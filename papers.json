    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest owing to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The development of [2 + 2] cyclases containing benzophenone triplet sensitizers highlights the potential of engineered enzymes as a platform for stereocontrolled energy transfer photocatalysis. However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (k\n            cat = 13 s−1, >1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As reactive intermediates and substructures of natural products and bioactive molecules, the smallest cyclic alkanes—cyclopropanes—are an attractive class of molecules for chemists. Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Engineered polyketide synthases (PKSs) have great potential as biocatalysts. These unnatural enzymes are capable of synthesizing molecules that are either not amenable to biosynthesis or are extremely challenging to access chemically. PKSs can thus be a powerful platform to expand the chemical landscape beyond the limits of conventional metabolic engineering. Here we employ a retrobiosynthesis approach to design and construct PKSs to produce δ-valerolactam (VL) and three enantiopure α-substituted VL analogues that have no known biosynthetic route. We introduce the engineered PKSs and pathways for various malonyl-CoA derivatives into Pseudomonas putida and use proteomics, metabolomics and culture condition optimization to improve the production of our target compounds. These α-substituted VLs are polymerized into polyamides (nylon-5) or converted into their N-acryloyl derivatives. RAFT polymerization produces bio-derived polymers with potential biomedical applications. Overall, this interdisciplinary effort highlights the versatility and effectiveness of a PKS-based retrobiosynthesis approach in exploring and developing innovative biomaterials."

The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)─O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high‐value‐added chemical feedstocks. Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)─O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)─O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging. This research advances the development of heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts as an option to enable organic transformations that have not yet been achieved using homogeneous catalysts."

During these preparations, the tetrylidynes [(Me3P)3Rh≡SnAr*] (4), and [(Me3P)3Rh≡PbAr*] (6), were also prepared in a one‐pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]‐fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar = Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (2–5) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me3P)3(CO)M‐E(η2‐O2CO‐κ2O)Ar*] [E = Ge, M = Rh (11); M = Ir (12); E = Sn, M = Rh (14), M = Ir (16)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the Group 14 element.

    "abstract": "AbstractHere, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono‐ or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals."

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as‐formed ROS by introducing Au SAs on CuOx/ZnO (Au1‐CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1‐CuOx/ZnO‐*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2‐pz and dxz/dyz‐px. This facilitated the dissociation of O−O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1‐CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C−H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4. Thus, Au1‐CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856 μmol·gcat.−1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions."

This ambient‐temperature approach significantly reduces aggregation, enhancing the exposure of catalytic active sites and delivering superior multi‐enzyme‐like activities (catalase, peroxidase, oxidase).

Inspired by the aesthetic configuration of negatively curved octagonal rings and the multiple resonance (MR) effect, we designed a novel diaza‐octagon heterocycle fused with PAHs, abbreviated as 8NN, and its phenyl‐substituted derivative 8NNP. Crystal data and theoretical calculations show that their peripheral PAHs exhibit significant rigidity, while the internal diaza‐octagon ring confers skeleton flexibility and flipping properties. Notably, owing to the strategic embedding and unique bonding form of nitrogen atoms, their MR effect is significantly enhanced. Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep‐blue emission peaking at 408 nm and 411 nm, with remarkably narrow full‐width at half‐maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm and 17 nm, respectively, and aggregation‐enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron‐functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461 nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31 nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively.

    "abstract": "Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (~4200 mAh g⁻¹). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion (~300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in‐situ conversed MgF₂ layer (with coating integrity of 94.6%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF₂ layer is in‐situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF₂‐1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000 mAh g⁻¹ at 10 C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9 mAh g‐1 after 500 cycles). Full‐cell based on the Si@MgF₂‐1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF‐rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon‐based LIBs."

    "abstract": "AbstractDFT calculations on β‐diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline‐earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae─Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(μ‐N2)Sr(BDI) with a side‐on bridging N22− dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI* = HC[(Me)C = N‐DIPeP]2, DIPeP = 2,6‐Et2CH‐phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6‐Sr); DIPePNN = DIPePN‐Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2‐NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6‐Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22− anion with side‐on bonding to Ae2+ and end‐on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms‐In‐Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6‐Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae = Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6‐Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon‐soluble reducing agents."

    "abstract": "AbstractAmmonia (NH3) emissions from industrial and agricultural activities pose severe environmental and health issues. Trace NH3 capture typically relies on chemisorption at Lewis acid sites or physisorption on porous adsorbents but usually suffers from irreversible binding, energy‐intensive regeneration, and structural degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a new hydration pathway as a promising solution. In a Cu(II)‐pyrazolate framework, BUT‐64(H2O), the bridging water molecules between adjacent Cu(II) ions serve as Brønsted acid sites to hydrate ammonia, achieving a remarkable NH3 packing density of 0.27 g cm−3 at 0.1 kPa and an adsorption capacity of 1.51 mmol g−1 for 1000 ppm NH3 under 80% relative humidity, among the leading adsorbents. The reversible hydration mechanism combines enhanced NH3 affinity with facile regeneration and mitigated moisture co‐adsorption, overcoming the inherent trade‐off. The remarkable alkaline stability of this material also highlights its potential as an energy‐efficient sorbent for trace NH3 capture."

    "abstract": "Nonadiabatic effects have been extensively studied in photoexcited processes, but their role in thermal process so far has neither been thoroughly studied nor appreciated, despite their significance. In this work, H2 and N2 activation mediated by a diuranium complex was studied from a nonadiabatic perspective using multi−configurational ab initio calculations combined with density functional theory. Stepwise electron transfer during the reaction enhances degeneracy between electronic states, enabling state‐to‐state transitions, i.e., spin downshift. The dual functionality of transition states acting as thermodynamic gateways and channels for nonadiabatic transitions was disclosed. The π and σ cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation. Bonding analysis reveals that U5f/6d orbitals mixing with H1s/N2p orbitals afford some degree of covalency to the primarily ionic U‐H/N interactions, with the 6d‐orbitals contributing more pronounced than the 5f‐orbitals in σ interactions, while the U‐N π bonding exhibits significant U5f contributions."

    "abstract": "AbstractScintillators featuring bright and fast‐response properties are essential for high‐speed and dynamic X‐ray imaging. Nevertheless, simultaneously possessing high light yields and fast‐response remains a significant challenge for most scintillators. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve the bright and fast‐response characteristics of scintillators by leveraging the combined effects of dielectric and molecular confinement in organic–inorganic hybrid scintillators (TPA)2MnBr4. Thereinto, large tetrapropylammonium cations (TPA+) surround [MnBr4]2− units, forming a zero‐dimensional (0D) molecular confinement structure that promotes electron localization and achieves a notable light yield of 56800 photons MeV−1. Meanwhile, the low dielectric constant of TPA+ can enhance dielectric confinement of [MnBr4]2− units, mitigating exciton capture by deep defects. These synergistic effects in the scintillators lead to a large exciton binding energy of 1028.8 meV and an ultrafast response time of 500 fs. Notably, under the irradiation of X‐rays, (TPA)2MnBr4 exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 18.7 nGyair s−1 and an exceptional spatial resolution of 21.0 lp mm−1. Given the bright and fast‐response features of scintillators, we demonstrate the potential applications in 3D dynamic and real‐time X‐ray imaging. These findings lay the groundwork for designing high‐performance scintillators and open avenues for innovative applications in high‐resolution and dynamic imaging."

    "abstract": "In the domain of polyolefin chemical recycling and upcycling, the economic viability of the resultant products is of utmost significance. Polysubstituted alkylbenzenes, especially those within the C9‐C12 alkylaromatic range, with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton, represent a high‐value segment with substantial yet unexploited potential for further development. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a co‐reactant, with the goal of achieving high‐yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 °C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low‐density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt % of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9‐C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope‐labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation‐mediated C‐C bond cleavage and self‐amplifying Friedel–Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway towards the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry."

Small‐molecule ligands can alter stability and folding of G4s, which can potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we investigate the interaction of telomeric DNA fragment from Tetrahymena thermophila (TET25, 5′‐G(TTGGGG)4‐3′) with a G4 ligand PyDH2 belonging to the bisquinolinium family. When alone, TET25 adopts a mixture of three conformations, with the most abundant being a four‐tetrad hybrid G4. In the presence of PyDH2, surprisingly, TET25 folds into an antiparallel chair G4, with PyDH2 intercalated between G‐tetrads 2 and 3, according to our crystal structure. The structure represents the second example, and the first crystallo­graphic evidence, of ligand intercalation into a G4. In solution, the interaction of PyDH2 and TET25 leads to a number of complexes differing by G4 topology and binding stoichiometry, strong stabilization of G4 (∆Tm = 12.4 °C in the presence of one equiv. of PyDH2) and large hysteresis of ∼ 10 °C, suggesting that ligand binding and G4 folding processes are complex."

Herein, the first microED study of Stryker's reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate. Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge‐ and face‐bridging hydrides."

Herein, we introduce a novel molecular design for amphiphilic supramolecular BBCPs that overcomes key challenges in the field. The resulting materials exhibit superior thermodynamic stability in weakly polar solvents. This enables the first demonstration of well‐controlled self‐assembly of supramolecular surfactants within a complex emulsion system, leading to the formation of photonic supraballs with homogenous porous structures. Critically, precise chain architectural engineering enables pore diameter tuning over an unprecedented nanometer‐to‐micrometer range (67 nm–1.92 µm), significantly surpassing the maximum domain sizes achievable with self‐assembled covalent BBCPs. This extends the photonic bandgap into the mid‐wave infrared range, paving the way for next‐generation materials with potential applications in thermal management."

Therefore, designing high‐molecular‐weight acceptors with well‐defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene‐tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g mol−1 and a well‐defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8‐IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high‐power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8‐BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state‐of‐the‐art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature (Tg), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high‐performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs."

    "abstract": "The redox non‐innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high‐valent metal ions and facilitating proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low‐valent metal centers, as high‐valent metal‐dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high‐valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)‐oxo complexes featuring hydrogen‐bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W‐oxo forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene‐sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen‐bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV→III reduction at –1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII‐OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV=O state would populate the dithiolene π* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal = –3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene‐S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV‐H catalytic species."

However, using this approach to create light‐responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, supramolecular polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross‐links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2‐(4‐methoxy­styryl)‐4,6‐bis(trichloromethyl)‐1,3,5‐triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self‐reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the supramolecular cross‐links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto‐rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding‐on‐demand adhesives was explored in proof‐of‐concept experiments."

However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in under achievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focusses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides towards capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides along with future directions are discussed."

    "abstract": "AbstractA facile, cost‐effective, and eco‐friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N‐codoped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal‐free and binder‐free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD‐B/N‐5, CPFD‐B/N‐10, and CPFD‐B/N‐15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol‐formaldehyde‐dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD‐N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder‐free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behavior. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD‐B/N‐10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22 Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00 W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid‐state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb."

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT•Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N‐dimethylformamide, and water, the UV‐visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50–100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 – 14 × 109 M−2). While the formation of charge‐transfer states through ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal‐bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine."

    "abstract": "Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl‐type reaction involving both 1,4‐aryl‐ and 1,2‐aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation‐ and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation‐ or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design."

    "abstract": "Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen‐based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C‐C=C‐C‐N framework along with C=C‐C=C‐C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E–Z photoisomerization but also the 6π‐photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes. The symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical diarylethenes and satisfied the Woodward‐Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in diarylethenes, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the 6π‐photocyclization."

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N‐alkyl‐N, N′‐diarylhydrazines by boronic acid‐catalyzed one‐pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N–N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation‐sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late‐stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Brønsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Brønsted acid and H‐bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate‐limiting step."

Herein, we disclose an unconventional intramolecular proton‐coupled electron transfer activation of α‐keto acids by photoredox catalysis to generate ketyl radicals toward accessing functionalizable lactones. These lactones serve as synthons for modular one‐pot syntheses of trifluoromethyl ketones in a net dicarbofunctionalization of electron‐rich olefins."

Advancements in on‐surface synthesis and in‐situ characterization techniques have emerged as powerful methods for the atomically precise fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in on‐surface synthesis of non‐hexagonal ring‐embedded GNRs via sophisticated design of precursors and optimized reaction pathways.

    "abstract": "AbstractCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine‐based COFs, yielding TFPT‐sp2c‐COF, with a C═C linkage and TFPT‐IM‐COF, with a C═N linkage. TFPT‐sp2c‐COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT‐IM‐COF. More importantly, the C═C linkage in TFPT‐sp2c‐COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C═N linkage in TFPT‐IM‐COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and π‐delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT‐sp2c‐COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT‐IM‐COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions."

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties which are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present novel approach for size‐tunable diameter separation of single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal‐coordinating supramolecular polymers (M‐PNB) consisting of phenanthroline‐based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M‐PNB is confirmed by TEM analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 – 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 – 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M‐PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)‐SWNTs. This method offers not only size‐tunable diameter selectivity, but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency, and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques."

It involves a one-pot sequential multicomponent reaction, which was carried out in two different approaches (with and without purification of 5-aminoisoxazole). The method forms five chemical bonds and offers advantages such as easy product purification, availability of raw materials, high reaction efficiency, and environmental friendliness. This synthetic strategy has the potential to advance developments in heterocyclic chemistry."

Control experiments highlight the superior reactivity of alkylzinc pivalates compared to the conversional alkylzinc halides. Moreover, this method is distinguished by its ample scope and facile derivatizations of the resulting products for increasing functional molecular complexity via sequence defluorinative strategy."

    "abstract": "AbstractWe present the first stereoselective synthesis of phosphonic and phosphinic analogues not only of (2S,3aS,6aS)-octahydrocyclopenta[b]pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, the pivotal intermediate in ramipril synthesis, but also of all its cis-fused stereoisomers. Key to this accomplishment is the highly diastereoselective synthesis of cis-fused bicyclic (3aS,6aS)- and (3aR,6aR)-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]pyrrol-2-one using Meyers’ tricyclic lactam methodology. The nucleophilic addition of trimethyl phosphite or dimethyl phenylphosphonite to chiral N-acyliminium ions affords the diastereoisomers, which are easily separated by column chromatography. The diastereoselectivity in the nucleophilic addition of the phosphorus reagents is completely consistent with our previous reports and all synthesized compounds were fully characterized."

    "abstract": "The incorporation of fluorine into organic molecules holds significant value. The three-component reaction provides a more convenient approach for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds. Radical monofluorination will be fully discussed in this review. Besides, other methods like transition metal-catalyzed, electrophilic, nucleophilic and carbine-mediated conditions will also be discussed. There are two main methods for producing monofluorinated compounds: forming C–F bonds using fluorinating agents, or creating C–C bonds with fluorinated substrates. The latter method boasts a wider range of applicable substrates. We will discuss reactions involving various substrates, including NFSI, KHF2, Selectfluor, FABI, Et3N·3HF, COF2, ICH2F, DAST and others. We will review the advancements made over the past decade (2014-2024) and offer explanations of the underlying mechanisms."

The arylfluorinative difunctionalization of cyclooctene-fused β-lactam, performed with phenylboronic acid, in the presence of Selectfluor, azacyclic ligands, and solvents, gave a separable mixture of various fluorinated and non-fluorinated products.

In this Review, we examine twenty case studies from the last two decades of R&D in the pharmaceutical industry where non-stereoselective routes identified during medicinal chemistry campaigns were revised and new solutions for the stereoselective API candidate syntheses were identified during process development."

    "abstract": "1,3-diols, which are a frequent motif in biologically active molecules, can be prepared from readily available allylic alcohols via formal anti-Markovnikov hydration. The commonly employed hydroboration-oxidation sequence for the synthesis of terminal alcohols is challenging for allylic alcohols, and O-protection of the alcohol can be necessary. To increase atom economy, we explored the use of silane protecting groups that can be engaged in intramolecular hydrosilylation. Oxidative cleavage of the cyclized product yields the desired 1,3-diol and obviates the need for super-stoichiometric borane reagents. Based on a detailed study of O-silylation conditions, a protocol is presented that furnishes quantitative yields of a wide range of O-silylated alcohols which contain Si–H bonds for further functionalization. We show that a MOF-based Rh(II) porphyrin can furnish efficient intramolecular hydrosilylation while the corresponding homogeneous analogue proved unreactive. Radical trapping studies suggest that silyl radicals constitute key intermediates in Rh(II) catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation. Preferential 5-endo-trig versus 6-exo-trig cyclization and 5-exo-trig versus 6-endo-trig cyclization of the silyl radical intermediates led to chemoselective 1,3-diol formation for substrates containing multiple olefins."

This review discusses the synthesis of ferrocene compounds potentially relevant to electrochemical applications, focusing on recent strategies for nondirected C–H functionalization of the ferrocene core and diverse reactions for side-chain modifications. Advances in C–H activation of ferrocenes have been facilitated by catalytic methods utilizing Pd, Ir, Au, In, and Fe catalysts, as well as through photoredox and electrochemical techniques. Furthermore, side chains are modified via a range of mild transformations compatible with the ferrocene core, including substitution and annulation.

One industrial application for HAT can be found in the tertiary benzylic C–H bond of cumene for producing phenol, a versatile chemical feedstock for various industries. However, the overall phenol yield remains low using the existing Hock process due to the poor selectivity towards the key reaction intermediate, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for phenol production through photooxidation of cumene to CHP using iron bromide under blue light irradiation, where bromine radicals (generated in situ via ligand-to-metal charge transfer) are used as hydrogen atom abstractors. Mechanistic studies revealed the cumene-to-CHP conversion occurred via a tertiary C–H bond abstraction by a radical mechanism, and the acetic acid and water additives increased CHP selectivity through stabilizing peroxides. The cumene-phenol process achieved up to 88% yield of CHP in 1 hour and could be used with a wide range of substrates. We thus developed a selective, mild, and efficient phenol production method using iron bromide under photooxidative conditions."

This article describes carbon dioxide fixation reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons promoted by Ni and Cu catalysts that we have recently developed. Notably, these reactions feature highly regio- and stereoselective C–C bond formation facilitated by key intermediates involving organometalloids."

However, the gaseous nature of these reagents, along with their intrinsic inertness due to their high bond-dissociation energies (99-105 kcal·mol-1), have rendered traditional strategies ineffective or lacking in selectivity. The use of flow chemistry technology, nonetheless, has made a tremendous impact in this field, improving the efficiency of multiphasic processes through improved mass transfer and larger interfacial areas. In this work, we report a new flow chemistry platform for the photocatalytic hydroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkenes with both isobutane and n-butane. The methodology provides an efficient alternative for the rapid obtention of trifluoromethyl alkanes, which are well-known for being important bioisosteres of several functional groups."

These radicals, acting as small molecular magnets, exhibit sensitivity to minute magnetic fields and can be tailored with diverse spin centers, making them ideal for spin-optical interfaces, representing key components in quantum communication systems. Furthermore, their ability to form organized, higher-dimensional assemblies presents a promising avenue for overcoming scalability challenges in quantum technologies. Despite their potential, achieving high luminescence quantum yields has largely been limited to donor-functionalized monoradicals, and a detailed understanding of the luminescent behavior of open-shell organic molecules remains elusive.

Most of these compounds are based on complex D–A–D structures or multi-D–A systems, such as 4CzIPN. Whereas these systems have been widely studied and applied as photocatalysts, simpler D–A structures remain less explored. Nevertheless, the simplicity of D–A structures makes them the ideal structures to further understand the structure–property relationship of D–A molecules for optimizing their photocatalytic performance by simpler modification of the different D–A subunits. In particular, D–A structures featuring sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors have gained increasing attention for their use as photoredox catalysts. This study introduces a new family of D–A molecules by exploring various sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors, including a novel tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) unit and 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine (IMD). Our findings demonstrate that these simple D–A structures exhibit promising photocatalytic properties, comparable to those of more complex D–A–D systems."

    "abstract": "The development of streamlined methodologies for the expeditious assembly of structurally diverse organic architectures represents a paramount objective in contemporary synthetic chemistry, with far-reaching implications across pharmaceutical development, advanced materials innovation, and fundamental molecular science research. In recent years, controllable/divergent synthetic strategies for organic functional molecules using common starting materials have garnered significant attention due to their high efficiency. This review categorizes recent literatures focusing on key regulatory factors for product divergent formation, in which controlling chemical selectivity primarily relies on ligands, metal catalysts, solvents, time, temperature, acids/bases, and subtle modifications of substrates. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying reaction activity and selectivity differentiation, the review provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms of critical steps through specific case studies. It is hoped that the controllable/divergent synthesis concept will spark the interest of practitioners and aficionados to delve deeper into the discipline and pursue novel advancements in the realm of chemical synthesis."

Host–dicarboxylate binding was investigated using 1H NMR titrations, revealing that B4aH exhibits strong binding affinities toward a series of dicarboxylates, with association constants reaching up to 6896 M−1. The selectivity for heptanedioate (C72−) was attributed to cooperative hydrogen bonding, anion–π interactions, and a size-matching effect, as supported by DFT optimizations."

We investigate the data practice of researchers publishing in specialist organic chemistry journals, by analyzing the outputs of 240 randomly selected research papers from 12 top-ranked journals published in early 2023. We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance. We suggest first steps that researchers can take to move towards a positive culture of data sharing in organic chemistry. Routine actions that we encourage as standard practice include deposition of raw and metadata to open repositories, and inclusion of machine-readable structure identifiers for all reported compounds."

Here, we disclose the photoactivation of simple alkenylboronic esters established using alkene scrambling as a rapid reaction probe to identify a suitable catalyst and boron motif. Cyclic voltammetry, UV–vis analysis, and control reactions support sensitization, enabling an intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition to be realized accessing 3D bicyclic fragments containing a boron handle."

Remarkably, Cs3PO4 exhibits the highest extraction efficiency, driven by strong cooperative interactions involving ion-dipole coordination between Cs+ and carbonyl (C=O) groups, as well as direct ion-pairing interactions between 18-crown-6-complexed Cs+ and hexaurea-bound PO43−. Single-crystal structural analysis corroborates these interactions, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and providing valuable guidance for the rational design of advanced dual-host systems for selective ion separation."

In this work, we synthesized novel N-acylpyrazole-based photoswitches and conducted a comparative study with 33 phenylazopyrazoles, comparing their photoswitching properties and the impact of electronic effects. Using UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy, we discovered that simple acylation of the pyrazole moiety leads to increased quantum yields of isomerization, long Z-isomer life-times, good spectral separation, and high photostability."

    "abstract": "Pyrrolidine-2,3-diones are important intermediates in the synthesis of numerous nitrogen-containing heterocycles which possess a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities. In this article, we report the synthesis of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,3-diones via a reversible transimination reaction between Schiff’ base (C=N) linkage-containing pyrrolidine-2,3-dione derivatives and methylamine with yields of 80 to 92%. In addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-diphenylpyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5a) was also verified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized molecules were evaluated for compliance with established drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, Egan, and Muegge), as well as ADMET properties. All compounds satisfied these criteria, indicating favorable oral bioavailability. Molecular docking analysis showed that compounds 5a–e act as ligands for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), especially with Cys200 and Ser242 via hydrogen bonds. In addition, van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the ligand–iNOS complexes. In particular, 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-5-phenyl-1-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5e) exhibited the strongest binding affinity (−9.51 kcal/mol) and demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production, with an IC50 value of 43.69 ± 5.26 µM. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (-NO2 group) on the benzene ring at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine-2,3-dione subunit in compound 5e may be responsible for the observed high inhibition activity due to the enhancement and optimization of hydrogen bonding with Cys200. These results underscore the potential of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidenepyrrolidine-2,3-diones, especially compound 5e, as promising scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting iNOS-related pathologies."

Herein, the first two‐step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase‐catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16 h using eco‐friendly t‐amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4 h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest."

In contrast, in the case of the 1,4‐diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron‐rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out."

    "abstract": "Chiral sulfinyl architectures have emerged as one of most important structural motifs in modern drug and agrochemical discovery due to their unique physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. They are also recognized as versatile platforms for novel chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Benefitting from the development of transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and biocatalysis technologies in recent years, attention has exploited to new tactics for the asymmetric construction of chiral sulfinyl compounds and their derivatives. This review highlights the advances in the field of catalytic preparation of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) since 2020, with an emphasis on the substrate scope, mechanistic aspect, unmet challenges, and future opportunities."

    "abstract": "Recently, an azine NNN–Pd(II) nonpalindromic pincer complex is generated, and its application in acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling is explored. This article establishes the application of the same pincer complex in the borrowing hydrogen process (BHP). Herein, the selective synthesis of C3 alkylated indoles (CAIs) is reported. Remarkably, this catalyst enables the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves BHP. The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage."

    "abstract": "para‐Terphenoquinone (pTPQ) in which a benzenoid ring has been replaced with a heterocycle is known as heteroterphenoquinone (HTPQ). While (H)TPQs are typically non‐emissive and potentially open‐shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the π‐conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium‐containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena‐hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO‐LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia‐analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) and thiaradialene (1.58 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low‐lying LUMO energy levels."

Herein we report a transition‐metal‐free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO. The use of cage‐shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates."

The results show that the introduction of thiophene and electron‐withdrawing end‐groups has resulted in the red‐shifted absorption of these complexes, with the absorption edge reaching 800 nm. These compounds have well solubility in organic solvents, more soluble than 8 mg mL−1 in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. The target molecules also have excellent photostability and thermal stability (Td > 325 °C)."

In this study, a series of chiral assemblies of porphyrin‐amino acid derivatives were prepared by linking different types of amino acids with terminal modifications to tetrakis(4‐carboxyphenyl)porphyrin via covalent bonding and their catalytic ability in enantioselective photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine was investigated. The results show that the amino acid type and terminal groups significantly affect the macroscopic assembly morphology and microscopic chiral space of the porphyrin‐amino acid derivatives, which is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations and further impacts on the rate and enantioselectivity of tyrosine chiral photocatalytic oxidation. These results provide new avenues for applying porphyrin derivatives in chiral photocatalysis."

The target saponins are synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions are performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provide excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3‐pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre‐activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3‐pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3‐pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre‐activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4‐disubstituted 3‐pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3‐pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations."

The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late‐stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs."

We have proposed a mechanism, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, where a hydrogen radical‐shuttle (HRS) process explains the chemical and stereochemical results. This work demonstrates the efficient stereoselective synthesis of structurally unique, highly functionalized nitrogen heterocyclic systems using simple protocols and affordable starting materials."

    "abstract": "AbstractA solid‐state Pd/Cu co‐catalyzed Sonogashira coupling facilitated by electromagnetic milling (EMM) was realized without solvent or additional heating. This strategy exhibited excellent substitutions tolerance and a wide substrate scope. The physical parameters were investigated, which proved both of magnetic field strength and frequency to be positive correlation to yields. Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh3, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by‐product from alkyne. The active catalyst complex for the Sonogashira coupling reaction in EMM is generated in situ. The EMM system offers a straightforward method for Sonogashira coupling and demonstrates significant potential for practical applications."

The method employs N‐Br aromatic amides as competent electrophilic halogenating agents that outpace other known reagents. The method works for glycosyl furans derived from the Garcia Gonzalez reactions of various active methylene compounds and unprotected sugars. Further functionalization of the C−Br bond of the 6‐bromo‐furo[3,2‐b]furans is explored as well."

A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co‐substrate H2O2. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an l‐amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide in situ at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95%."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe skeleton editing strategy has emerged as a transformative approach in drug discovery and agrochemical innovation, enabling precise modifications through the insertion, elimination, or substitution of specific atoms within the core carbon‐ or heterocyclic frameworks of molecules. Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single‐carbon‐atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five‐membered carbon‐ and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six‐membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven‐membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo‐ and electro‐catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single‐carbon‐atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology."

Nevertheless, thermal activation remains mandatory in most cases, which may decrease the compatibility with sensitive functional groups. In this context, improvements of conventional strategies must be an important source of research in order to enhance the applicability of such methods for building complex scaffolds. In this work, we contribute to this aim by implying visible‐light as the sole energy source in a Pd‐catalyzed rearrangement reaction involving N‐tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. These mild reaction conditions efficiently allow oxidative addition, aryl migration and β‐hydride elimination at room temperature, allowing the construction of various 1,1’ disubstituted olefins."

    "abstract": "AbstractAqueous solutions of nanoparticles are the cornerstones for applications in diagnostics, catalysis and more, where control over the nanoparticle's dispersion is pivotal to tailoring the final product properties. Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono‐disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra‐dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room‐temperature structural transformation‐induced in situ core‐shell self‐assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre‐core‐shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit >80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential >80 mV) even after >10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single‐photon emission with g(2)(0) M is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering."

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon‐based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium‐ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide‐based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double‐layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of π‐conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub‐graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon‐like large π‐conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen‐free edge C(sp2)–H sites, and well‐defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g−1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g−1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials. These findings provide a fundamental design strategy for carbon‐based cathodes in LICs that highlighting the role of π‐conjugation and edge chemistry in electrochemical performance, paving the way for next‐generation high‐capacity, high‐voltage energy storage devices."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid‐state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)‐vacancies (O‐LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐based CPEs (PEO@O‐LZO). The O‐LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O‐vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O‐vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O‐LZO at 40 °C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O‐LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40 °C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid‐state lithium metal batteries."

    "abstract": "AbstractSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non‐invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off‐target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic‐based Calibrated 5‐ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non‐pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5‐ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia‐inducible promoter regulating O‐acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post‐treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor‐specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5‐ALA‐based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor‐targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes."

    "abstract": "AbstractManipulating the crystal structure and microstructure is fundamentally paramount for designing advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. Kagome‐lattice metals attracted considerable attention due to desirable electronic and magnetic properties but are rarely considered for application as structural materials. In this study, a concept of kagome composite is proposed to realize mechanically zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy over a wide temperature window, exemplified by the Lu‐Fe‐Co ternary alloys prepared by two‐step synthesis. Using magnetic Co doping, the kagome lattice magnetic order is stabilized in the parent hexagonal Lu2Fe17 structure, and its thermal expansion regulated simultaneously. By in situ precipitation of the α‐(Fe/Co) phase in the matrix, a soft/hard heterogeneous structure emerges and an ultra‐wide temperature window axial ZTE composite (αl = +0.98 × 10−6 K−1, 110–800 K) with good compressive strength (1.11 GPa) is achieved. This work opens up the prospect of kagome intermetallic composite in the integration of structure and function."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe ability of cytokine receptors to mediate the internalization of targets in lysosomes positions them as specific and effective effectors for protein degradation strategies. However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell‐proliferation‐related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7‐targeting chimera (AP‐CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein‐targeting aptamer with a mutant‐CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP‐CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP‐CRTAC constructed with a 2′ F‐pyrimidine‐modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP‐CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR‐targeted therapies, to the third‐generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This research introduces an engineered CXCR7 inducer with high specificity and programmability for the targeted degradation of cell surface proteins, while minimizing unwanted side effects."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe silicon microparticles (SiMPs) offer a promising solution for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion battery systems. However, the inevitable volume expansion (>300%) of SiMPs during alloying often leads to particle breakage, interface rupture, and electrode separation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid–liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high‐energy‐density flexible lithium‐ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid‐phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid‐phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of >99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high‐voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm−2, high volumetric energy density of 500 Wh L−1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0 mm. This work provides a new electrode design approach to achieve high‐energy‐density flexible lithium‐ion batteries."

    "abstract": "AbstractAdvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon‐based single‐atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra‐effective and anti‐interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in‐depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro‐level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular‐oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state‐of‐the‐art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the “oxidant‐catalyst‐pollutants” internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC‐AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting‐edge laboratory devices and pilot‐scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs‐AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided. This review aims to promote the large‐scale potential of SACs‐based AOPs in practical water treatment by emphasizing the pivotal role of micro‐insights."

    "abstract": "AbstractSolar‐driven one‐step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber‐Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra‐low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co‐synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO‐Fe), enabling the formation spatially‐separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d‐electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO‐Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo‐photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi‐directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction."

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but existing photocatalysts often suffer from modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co‐activation, such as Mg‐activated water or non‐sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon‐nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox‐flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry."

By analyzing academic papers from the DEE field, the network identifies innovative, inexpensive, and sustainable Lewis bases to pair with Zn(BF4)2·xH2O. A Zn(BF4)2·xH2O‐ethylene carbonate (EC) system demonstrates high conductivity (10.6 mS cm−1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (2.37 V). The optimized electrolyte enables stable zinc stripping/plating, achieves outstanding rate performance (81 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), and supports 4000 cycles in Zn||polyaniline cells at 3 A g−1. Spectroscopic analyses and simulations reveal that EC coordinates to Zn2+, mitigating water‐induced corrosion, while a fluorine‐rich hybrid organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enhances stability.

    "abstract": "AbstractCyanogroup (‐CN) is a strongly electron‐withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high‐performance small‐molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN‐F, phCN‐Cl, 2phCN‐F, and 2phCN‐Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN‐F‐based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN‐F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85°C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record‐breaking SMAs."

    "abstract": "AbstractInorganic hydrogels have great potential in many applications as sustainable materials, but lack flexibility due to rigid network structures. Here, a novel strategy is proposed—an inorganic polymer hydrogel, prepared by crosslinking long‐chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+), which effectively address the rigidity and fragility issues commonly associated with traditional inorganic gels. With the most stable hydration shell among those ions, Ni2+ tends to interact indirectly with LPP through hydrogen bonds rather than coordination bonds. The unique Ni2+‐phosphate interaction endows the Ni‐LPP hydrogels with ultrahigh elongation at break (≈15 000×). Further experiments reveal that the Ni2+‐phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor. The highly extensible, good conductive (1.06 ± 0.08 S m−1), self‐healing (within 30 s and without stimulation), arbitrarily shapeable, and nonflammable Ni‐LPP inorganic hydrogel indicates a bright future in flexible electronics, environmental remediation, and beyond."

Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity‐related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light‐responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual‐targeting and multiple‐signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1‐like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low‐grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs‐mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long‐term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light‐sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems."

However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order–disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25 V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order–disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li‐rich cathode materials through a dedicated order–disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage."

Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy‐saving H₂ production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high‐value‐added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode.

In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure–performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part.

The need for enhanced contrast through improved tumor‐to‐background ratio (TBR) and the toxicity from repeated injections due to fading fluorescent signals further complicate the issue. Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface‐stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image‐guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin‐conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR ∼ 2), while enabling prolonged 3‐day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation. This innovative method offers substantial improvements over existing fluorescent contrast agents and holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer surgery."

Herein, this study distinct subgroups and two differentiation pathways associated with N1 and N2 polarization during AP by single‐cell sequencing. Inspired by this, a hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO2)‐based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) conjugated with neutrophil‐binding Ly‐6G antibody and loaded with porphyrin is developed for targeted and in situ modulation of neutrophil polarization. Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O2, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive single‐cell atlas of neutrophils in AP and proposes an innovative hitchhiking therapeutic strategy for AP by restricting ROS in neutrophils."

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping organic aggregation‐induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) excitable with the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) light, which offers enhanced tissue penetration and a high maximum permissible exposure to light, is highly advantageous for bioimaging applications but remains a significant challenge. In this work, the molecular lock strategy is employed to fuse two alkyl‐substituted thiophenes, leading to the design of alkyl‐substituted dithieno[3,2‐b:2′,3′‐d]pyrrole (aDTP). This novel π‐bridge features a planar structure with strong electron‐donating capability while suppressing intermolecular π–π interactions, enabling the construction of an NIR‐II absorption‐active AIEgen, named aDTP‐TPA. The enhanced π‐conjugation and donor‐acceptor interactions of aDTP‐TPA result in NIR‐II absorption and an increased molar extinction coefficient (ɛ), exhibiting superior photophysical properties compared to its thiophene‐based counterparts, C6T‐TPA and DC6T‐TPA. When formulated into water‐soluble nanoparticles (NPs), aDTP‐TPA NPs demonstrate remarkable tissue penetration depth and improved imaging resolution. In vivo studies, systemic blood vessel angiography, mesenteric circulation imaging, brain vasculature visualization, and NIR‐II‐guided tumor surgery underscore the exceptional imaging capabilities of these NPs for biomedical applications. This work highlights that the molecularly locked π‐bridge strategy holds great promise for developing AIEgens with NIR‐II excitation, paving the way for advanced NIR‐II bioimaging applications."

However, the necessity of an auxiliary field for achieving deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization is the critical bottleneck for practical application. Here, it is demonstrated that an unconventional spin current with perpendicular spin polarization can be generated by the alignment of uncompensated interfacial spins at the ultrathin IrMn/Ta(Ti) or PtMn/Ta(Ti) interfaces prepared with the presence of an in situ field, which allows field‐free switching. Furthermore, due to the pinned interfacial spins exerted by the bulk antiferromagnetic layers, the switching polarity remains unchanged after a disturbance field of 3000 Oe or higher, showing strong writing robustness against stray field disturbance. The work offers a strategy to address the critical bottleneck and promotes the advancement of SOT‐MRAM toward commercialization."

Despite significant progress, achieving field‐free switching of perpendicular magnetization with short current pulses, minimal incubation delay, and low energy consumption remains a critical obstacle for the practical realization of high‐speed SOT devices. Here, field‐free SOT switching is demonstrated at sub‐nanosecond timescales in a PtTe2/WTe2/CoFeB heterostructure that fulfills all above requirements. The unique combination of WTe2, with its low crystal symmetry, facilitates field‐free SOT switching at reduced current densities, while PtTe2, characterized by its high spin Hall conductivity, enhances energy efficiency. Moreover, the significant in‐plane spin Hall conductivity from PtTe2 contributes to shortening the incubation delay. The results establish a promising path toward energy‐efficient, high‐speed SOT memory devices, offering a practical field‐free solution to meet the performance demands of next‐generation memory technologies."

The easily formed stacking faults (SFs) in vdW layered materials hide the intrinsic optical/electrical properties, adverse to practical application. Here, a unique low‐temperature annealing strategy is adopted to eliminate the SFs in flexible γ‐InSe and optimize the crystal quality. The annihilation dynamics of the SFs are revealed by using the in situ heating observation on the state‐of‐the‐art spherical aberration‐corrected transmission electron microscopy. The annealed γ‐InSe not only exhibits intrinsic out‐of‐plane sliding ferroelectricity in a wide thickness range from a single unit cell (trilayer) to tens of nanometers, but also demonstrates efficient superlinear photoluminescence with higher beam quality and lower thresholds.

    "abstract": "AbstractPolar interfaces with broken inversion symmetry have garnered significant attention due to their profound influence on charge/spin distribution and propagation, leading to unconventional phenomena such as high‐mobility electron gas, polar skyrmions, and interfacial pyroelectric/pyro‐phototronic effects. Designing and controlling polar interfaces is crucial for developing advanced functional electronic devices. Here, a strategy of polar interface engineering is proposed by modulating the built‐in electric field in Schottky junctions to generate and tune the pyro‐phototronic effect in a centrosymmetric semiconductor (β‐Ga2O3). By varying the work functions of metal electrodes and doping concentrations, the built‐in electric field is effectively controlled, enabling modulation of the effective polarization and pyroelectric coefficient. Leveraging the pyro‐phototronic effect, the Ga2O3 Schottky junction‐based self‐powered photodetector achieves an ultrafast response of 0.2 µs to solar‐blind UV light, representing a 50‐fold improvement over the control device operating with the photoconductive effect. Furthermore, five optoelectronic logic gates are realized, enabled by the bidirectional pyro‐phototronic current during light switching. These findings provide a pathway for exploring novel pyro‐phototronic phenomena in polar‐interface‐engineered semiconductors and advancing ultrafast optoelectronic detection technologies."

Both materials exhibit multienzyme‐like (oxidase‐, peroxidase‐, superoxide dismutase‐, catalase‐like) activities, with Cu‐SLCDs showing higher activity levels. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that, compared to CuN‐CDs, the polyphenol p‐π conjugated structure creates a unique electron‐donating coordination environment, which increases the electron density of Cu‐SLCDs at the Fermi level, enhances electron transfer, and boosts multienzyme‐like activities. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Cu‐SLCDs effectively eliminate over 98.6% of bacteria at a concentration of 25 µg mL−1, while reducing reactive oxygen species levels in normal cells to promoting efficient wound healing.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe molecular weight of conjugated polymers profoundly influences organic solar cell (OSC) efficiency, yet the structural mechanisms driving this relationship remain unresolved. Here, it is demonstrated that polymer conformation, governed by backbone rigidity and persistence length, is the critical determinant of molecular weight dependent performance in bulk‐heterojunction OSCs. By analyzing the benchmark polymers PM6 and D18, opposing trends is uncovered: PM6 achieves peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.11% at low number‐average molecular weight (Mn∼51 kDa), 18.47% at medium‐Mn (68 kDa), and declining to 16.83% at high Mn (122 kDa), whereas D18 improves from 16.87% (41 kDa) to 17.75% (67 kDa) and 19.15% (83 kDa). Neutron scattering and computational modeling reveal that D18's bulky 2‐butyloctyl side chains impose high rotational barriers, stiffening the backbone and extending its persistence length. This rigidity enables high‐Mn D18 to form ordered crystalline domains that enhance charge transport. In contrast, PM6's flexible backbone shortens its persistence length, driving amorphous tie‐chain formation at high Mn that disrupts crystallinity and exacerbates recombination. These results establish polymer conformation and persistence length as universal descriptors linking Mn to microstructure, resolving long‐standing contradictions in polymer design."

    "abstract": "AbstractRespiratory infections are the major cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide, which impose a heavy burden on public healthcare. Many respiratory viruses induce indistinguishable clinical symptoms, making accurate detection and effective surveillance challenging. Here, a polarization‐sensitive multiplex biochip is presented utilizing self‐assembled anisotropic nanochains for simultaneous colorimetric detection of multiple pathogens in human nasal, throat, and serum samples. The biochip features a patterned wettability surface, wherein the hydrophobic pattern facilitates precise sample segmentation, blocking the detection interferences. The hydrophilic areas can be utilized not only to print functionalized nanochains for selective identifications of different respiratory viruses, but also to support target preconcentration through the coffee‐ring phenomenon, enhancing the efficiency of virus detection. Furthermore, strong light confinement is shown near the nanochain surface by tailoring incident polarization, which enlarges colorimetric response sensitivity to virus loading. Thus, the simultaneous quantification of various respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and adenovirus, is achieved with a detection limit of 10 PFU mL−1. In clinical tests, influenza patients are successfully distinguished from other volunteers with an accuracy of 96.2%. This method eliminates the need for extrinsic labels or preamplification, which is expected to expand at‐home diagnostic tools for respiratory pathogens."

A lentivirus carrying the triple‐fusion probe is prepared for stable transfection of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

Then, hiPSC‐derived neural progenitors and hCOs are transplanted into the mouse brains. Multimodal imaging is performed to trace the survival, distribution, integration, and functional activity of transplanted cells, providing multi‐scale data of exogenous cell behavior and fate in host brains.

Yet their practical use is hindered by structural damage under high pressure. Conventional strategies like thickening membranes, reducing interlayer spacing, or cross‐linking nanosheets improve pressure resistance but significantly reduce water permeability to impractical levels (e.g., 0.15 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 at 60 bar). Here, this dilemma is addressed by designing ultrathin GO/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid membranes. The CNT network reinforces the stacked GO nanosheets by reducing their free‐standing diameter while increasing membrane thickness and Young's modulus. The pressure resistance is achieved up to 60 bar, triple that of the pristine GO membranes. A maximum water flux of 966 ± 96 L m−2 h−1 is achieved by a 68 nm thick GO/CNT membrane with optimal GO nanosheet size and CNT loading amount, facilitating 1–3 orders of magnitude higher water flux per unit membrane thickness than all available membranes. This breakthrough resolves the critical trade‐offs among pressure resistance, flux, and membrane thickness, marking a transformative leap in GO‐based nanofiltration efficiency. The innovation holds immediate potential for applications in sustainable water remediation, pharmaceuticals, energy storage, and electronics."

Traditional therapies struggle to balance tumor elimination with bone preservation and functional restoration. This study presents a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing high‐purity biodegradable magnesium (Mg) implants, which induce dual‐mode bone tumor death orchestrated by the cGAS‐STING pathway. Released Mg ions trigger autophagic cell death through TRPM7‐mediated uptake, with cGAS‐STING promoting LC3 lipidation by supplying STING‐laden ERGIC membranes. Simultaneously, alkaline degradation byproducts disrupt tumor metabolism by suppressing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, with cGAS‐STING further targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2) to amplify metabolic collapse. This coordinated mechanism reshapes the tumor microenvironment, promoting M1 macrophage polarization, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and enhanced intratumoral IFN‐γ secretion, fostering a robust, sustained immune response. The therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of Mg implants are validated in murine osteosarcoma, patient‐derived xenografts, and VX2 rabbit bone tumor models, demonstrating significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival without systemic toxicity. This work highlights the multifunctional capabilities of biodegradable Mg implants, integrating autophagic death, metabolic suppression, and immune modulation through cGAS‐STING coordination, presenting a promising and clinically translatable strategy for advanced bone tumor therapy."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe efficient conversion of CO2 to light olefins via CO2‐modified Fischer‐Tropsch synthesis (CO2‐FTS) with high selectivity and yield remains a critical challenge. Here, the Fe3O4‐FeCo‐Fe5C2 ternary catalyst was successfully constructed. Notably, the different contents of Co doping optimized the heterogeneous catalytic interface of the FeCo alloy clusters, which promoted the targeted conversion of CO2 to light olefins in high yield (22.4%) and effectively suppressed the generation of CO (4.4%). The study shows that the formation of FeCo alloy clusters significantly promotes the forward progression of the Reverse Water‐Gas Reaction (RWGS), which can greatly enhance the conversion of CO2 and inhibit the formation of CO according to Le Chatelier's principle. Moreover, the FeCo alloy clusters significantly promoted the rapid formation of CHx and induced the chain growth of CHx on Fe5C2 phase. Hence, the clever construction of FeCo alloy clusters significantly strengthens the kinetic coupling between the RWGS and FTS reactions. Additionally, the in‐situ structural evolution of the catalysts, along with the real‐time formation process of the products, was monitored through in‐situ characterization. This work is promising to provide an effective strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to achieve high yields of light olefins over FeCo alloy clusters."

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to its unique combination of electrochemical and optical techniques, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) offers several advantages in biosensing and attracts extensive attention in diverse fields from bioanalysis to clinical diagnosis. The performance of biosensors significantly relies on effective signal transduction, making signal regulation crucial. Functional carbon‐containing materials show significant potential for modulating electronic structure, controlling their physiochemical properties, thus emerging as promising candidates for biosensing applications. While comprehensive reviews exist for PEC biosensors based on other materials, a dedicated review specifically focusing on carbon‐containing materials and strategies utilized to enhance their photoelectrochemical performance remains scarce. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the utilization of carbon‐containing materials in PEC biosensing, outlining the challenges and strategies used to enhance their performance. The key strategies include the electronic structure modulation (e.g., engineering doping and defects, enriching charge‐transfer pathway, and constructing built‐in electric field) and structural and surface control (e.g., improving light harvesting ability and constructing biocompatible interfaces). Furthermore, this review examines recent progress in carbon‐containing materials for PEC biosensing, highlighting the unique advantages and diverse applications. Finally, this review discusses the key challenges and future opportunities in this field, providing insights to guide the development of next‐generation, high‐performance PEC biosensors."

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular functionalization of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which unites tailorability of organic molecules and robustness of inorganic solids, is important for tuning their surface properties. While it is common to leverage the electronic effect of organic ligands to functionalize TMDs, the corresponding steric hinderance has remained elusive and underexplored. Herein N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) functionalization of WS2 is demonstrated via a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) route, which exploits both the electronic and steric effect for TMD functionalization. The Lewis base, 1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)imidazol‐2‐ylidene (IMes), is anchored to the sulfur vacancy sites (Lewis acid) of the WS2 nanostructures with the hybrid‐interface‐mediated steric hinderance, mimicking the FLP chemistry and enabling dihydrogen cleavage at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) results reveal the local chemical environment of the activated hydrogen species, which can be transferred for room‐temperature hydrogenation reactions. The insights are useful for designing weak, non‐covalent bonds to modify the 2D surface of TMDs for a broad scope of applications."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe high‐power‐density and high‐temperature operation of third‐generation power semiconductor devices (e.g., SiC/GaN) is limited by epoxy resin (EP)‐based packaging materials due to three key challenges: (1) Low thermal conductivity brings heat accumulation; (2) High interfacial stress from the ≈ 20 times higher thermal expansion coefficient of EP versus SiC/GaN causes thermal cycling‐induced interfacecracks, significant performance or lifespan degradation and even device failure; (3) The flammable nature of EP enhances the risk factor caused by thermal runaway. Herein, a thermal‐expansion offset and flame retardant Zn1.5Cu0.5P2O7 (ZCPO) is design with a negative thermal expansion coefficient of ‐20 × 10−6/ °C, within temperature ranges of 20 ∼ 190 °C, which enables to achieve a ceramic‐like thermal expansion coefficient (4 × 10−6/ °C) and UL‐94 V‐0 rating flame retardancy in ZCPO/EP‐61 composite for the first time. The perfectly matched thermal expansion coefficient minimizes the interfacial stress between EP and chips or thermoelectric cooler, thus a simple thermoelectric cooling architecture is designed for power semiconductor device without thermal interface material 2 (TIM2), which enables to achieve a cooling temperature of 26.85 °C, 8 °C lower than that with TIM2 (18.89 °C)."

    "abstract": "AbstractAltermagnetism and ferroelectricity are reported in certain materials. However, the possibility of their coexistence or interplay in a single‐material phase remains an open question. Here, the multiferroicity in hexagonal wurtzite MnSe (w‐MnSe) is explored via first‐principles calculations. The w‐MnSe exhibits an altermagnet semiconducting nature characterized by a direct bandgap of 1.98 eV and spin splitting of up to 245 meV in the valence band structure. The w‐MnSe has an in‐plane magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of −31 µeV per cell along the a‐direction and a Néel temperature (TN) of ≈405 K. Besides, the w‐MnSe exhibits a giant out‐of‐plane spontaneous electric polarization of 53 µC cm−2 and a moderate energy barrier of 0.37 eV f.u−1. The ferroelectric critical temperature (TC) of 965 K is obtained, and this may indicate excellent thermal stability. The correlation is postulated between altermagnetim and ferroelectricity to control spin orientation mediated by the rotation of polyhedra formed by nonmagnetic elements within the lattice structure. The finding implies that the w‐MnSe can be a potential material for future‐generation multiferroic devices that operate above room temperature."

    "abstract": "AbstractImpaired fracture healing in diabetic patients poses a persistent clinical challenge, with underlying mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated. These findings reveal that high glucose microenvironments generate excessive reactive oxygen species in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic impairment. These pathophysiological disruptions suppress osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs while driving pro‐inflammatory polarization in BMDMs, processes closely tied to high‐glucose‐induced inhibition of Adenosine 5′‐monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Restoration of AMPK phosphorylation emerges as a pivotal strategy to mitigate oxidative stress and restore cellular function. To address this, a dual‐targeted therapeutic system (DLNPs@HA hydrogel) is developed that combines anti‐CD105‐antibody‐modified nanoliposomes and phosphatidylserine‐modified nanoliposomes, both encapsulating the specific AMPK activator α‐lipoic acid. This hydrogel facilitates sustained nanoparticle release, enabling precise and effective delivery to BMSCs and BMDMs. In vitro, DLNPs@HA hydrogel successfully enhances osteogenic activity and suppresses inflammatory responses. In vivo, it accelerates fracture healing in diabetic mice. By precisely targeting BMSCs and BMDMs and reversing bicellular oxidative stress, this integrative medical‐engineering strategy provides a promising and translatable solution for diabetic fracture repair, seamlessly bridging mechanistic insights with therapeutic innovation."

Here an organic dye molecule is reported, 1,3,6,8‐tetrakis(4‐ethynylbenzoic acid)pyrene (TEBAPy), that exhibits two aggregate states in aqueous conditions: nanofibers or nanoparticles, depending on the charge‐screening conditions. The nanofibers promote sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen production (H2, 84 mmol g−1 h−1) while the nanoparticles produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 85 mmol g−1 h−1). Using a combination of structural and photophysical characterizations, it is shown that the photocatalytic activity is determined by the nature of the formed self‐assembled aggregate, demonstrating the potential of supramolecular nanostructures to tune their activity and switch their reactivity. It is shown clear correlation between the presence of fibrous nanostructures and photocatalytic H2 evolution, with spectroscopy showing mixing of excitonic states that enables efficient charge separation over multiple chromophore units. In the nanoparticular aggregates, on the contrary, the excitation is localized and leads to excimer formation that is involved in H2O2 production. The results demonstrate that the molecular packing of a single chromophore in self‐assembled organic nanostructures can not only optimize solar fuel production but also enable multiple and switchable photocatalytic functions."

    "abstract": "Global reliance on synthetic surfactants has led to significant environmental challenges, with current management and policy efforts proving to be largely ineffective. Sustainable and environment‐friendly surfactants offer a promising solution for mitigating these impacts. This study introduces an emulsifier composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and partially cation‐substituted hyaluronate (CHA), both of which are derived from abundant and cost‐effective natural polysaccharides. The synergistic interplay of electrostatic interactions and controlled molecular entanglement between these macromolecules significantly enhances the stability and ripening resistance of the water‐in‐oil emulsion. This optimized formulation demonstrates remarkable longevity, maintaining emulsion integrity for over 365 days while exhibiting exceptional salt tolerance and pH stability across various environmental conditions. Additionally, this entangled polysaccharide‐based Pickering emulsion demonstrated strong adhesion to leaf surfaces, resisting the effects of strong winds and the water‐repellent properties of the lotus leaves. These characteristics associated with microbial compatibility suggest that emulsifiers based on CNCs and CHA provide safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants, especially pertinent to the agrochemical sector."

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic CC coupling of 2,5‐dimethylfuran (DMF) derived from processing lignocellulosic biomasses coproduces drop‐in fuels and green hydrogen with a low‐carbon footprint. However, the high reaction barrier for CH bond breaking and uphill overall reaction lead to the slow kinetics of DMF coupling. Here, we reveal that [HSO4−] and water can collaboratively promote the rate‐limiting step of the CH bond breaking on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 catalyst. An in‐depth study suggests that water mediates hole transfer to the CH bond while [HSO4−] facilitates electron extraction, thus promoting electron and proton transfer on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 surface. Consequently, photocatalytic DMF coupling over Ru‐ZnIn2S4 produces diesel fuel precursors (DFPs) and H2 with benchmarking formation rates of 1.5 g gcatal.−1 h−1 and 9.7 mmol gcatal.−1 h−1, respectively. Moreover, the selectivity of branched‐chain DFPs reaches 55%. This work puts forward new insight and strategy for photocatalytic CC coupling for the synthesis of biofuels."

    "abstract": "Catalytic fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising technology for obtaining different fractions and the valorization of lignin. Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is one of these technologies in which catalysts play an essential role. In this work, the impact of impurities in catalysts on the output of RCF is investigated. It is found that the yield of phenolic monomers is almost not influenced by the residual chloride (Cl) ions in the commercially available Ru/C catalyst. However, the presence of Cl ions in the catalyst facilitated hemicellulose removal and delignification. Moreover, the enzymatic conversion rate of cellulose in the solid residue increases after RCF, attributed to the enhanced removal of lignin and hemicellulose in the presence of Cl ions. The impact of Cl ions can be eliminated by removing the Cl ions in the catalyst. This work provides an engineering perspective for upscaling RCF technology using large‐scale synthesized catalysts."

    "abstract": "Developing a selective lignin depolymerization process remains a daunting challenge due to lignin's inherent structural heterogeneity and chemical complexity. This study used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction to produce oligomeric lignin with controlled structural characteristics (narrow size distribution, lower molecular weight) and further subjected it to oxidative depolymerization using peracetic acid as an oxidant. Oxidation of lignin resulting from lactic acid/pyrazole and choline chloride/lactic acid extraction produces phenolic acids (Ph‐COOH) and dicarboxylic acid (DCA) as significant products. Our results show that the judicial choice of DES during extraction plays a critical role in determining the lignin chemical structure, which follows different oxidation pathways and results in different product selectivities. The generalization of this concept has been established with two different parent lignins, e.g., Douglas fir (D.fir) and wheat straw (WS). The overall process showed that the novel DES extraction not only provides a sustainable pathway for high‐purity lignin generation but also could be used as a tool to produce high‐value products selectively upon its oxidation, thus improving the overall lignin biorefinery process."

    "abstract": "The all‐iron redox flow battery (AIRFB) has garnered significant attention in the field of energy storage due to its advantages of cost, aqueous chemistry, safety, and sustainability. The traditional deposited AIRFB has a limited depth of discharge and is prone to metal dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution side reactions during operation. In contrast, the all‐soluble AIRFB, where the active substances are all fully soluble, offers flexible operation that is more conducive to industrial development of AIRFB. However, the all soluble AIRFB electrolyte still requires improvement of its solubility, long‐term stability, reactivity, and electrode potential. This review introduces the concepts for modification of the AIRFB electrolyte and presents the main ideas and methods for electrolyte improvement, as well as the challenges faced and possible research directions for the future."

    "abstract": "Pd‐catalyzed aminations, a powerful and commonly employed method of CN bond construction, often rely on unsustainable technologies that utilize egregious organic solvents, high temperatures, long reaction times, and high catalyst loadings, especially of palladium. Only recently there has been a shift toward far greener protocols based on recyclable aqueous media as well as nontraditional organic solvents. In addition, alternatives to batch methods for preparing the same amines have appeared, such as continuous flow and mechanochemistry, which also offer safe and sustainable means of chemical synthesis associated with targets in the fine chemicals industry."

However, both monomer and polymer syntheses typically require anaerobic and moisture‐free conditions, often employing hazardous reagents and solvents that limit scalability. Herein, efficient, scalable syntheses for poly(ethyl lipoate) and ethyl lipoate that incorporate Green Chemistry principles are disclosed. The synthesis of ethyl lipoate from lipoic acid on a 100‐gram scale (>80% yield) is optimized lowering the E‐factor (2.27) by an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Diphenyl phosphate, a nonhazardous commercial organic acid, is used to synthesize ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethyl lipoate) on a 50‐gram scale from cationic ROP (CROP). The polymerizations proceed under ambient atmosphere in low‐hazard and renewable solvents, and a mild depolymerization strategy to regenerate the monomer is developed. Due to their extreme molar mass, the materials possess unique mechanical and physical properties. Life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted on synthetic and recycling processes shows that the polydisulfide has competitive environmental impacts comparable to several commodity polymers, despite the latter having an efficiency advantage due to economies of scale. These discoveries establish an economical and scalable closed‐loop polymer platform that can be broadly applied to various polydisulfides sourced from 1,2‐dithiolanes such as lipoic acid."

This study introduces liquid humins as precursors for synthesizing innovative carbon materials tailored for Pd/C catalysts. These materials mitigate the “dead” metal issue, where inaccessible Pd particles hinder catalytic efficiency. By exploring methods to convert liquid humins into carbon materials with optimized porous structures and nitrogen doping, we developed Pd/C catalysts with significantly enhanced performance. A novel carbon support derived from a composite of thermally cured humins and melamine exhibited low microporosity and high nitrogen content, thereby minimizing Pd encapsulation. Catalytic applications of these Pd/C materials in Suzuki‐Miyaura, Mizoroki‐Heck, and nitroarene hydrogenation reactions demonstrated superior activity, surpassing many existing biomass‐derived Pd/C catalysts. The work highlights humins as a renewable resource for high‐performance catalyst development, addressing critical sustainability and efficiency challenges in catalysis. This approach opens new avenues in green chemistry and valorization of industrial by‐products, paving the way for cost‐effective and scalable applications in organic synthesis."

    "abstract": "This paper presents three sulfone‐ or cyano‐decorated photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with adjustable arm lengths and linkages for photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is found that, upon replacing imine linkage with cyanated vinylene, under the irrdation of visible light, the H2O2 production rates (HPR) considerably increases from 2261 μmol h‐1 g‐1 to 7613 μmol h‐1 g‐1 in pure water and O2 atmosphere without the assistance of any sacrificial agent. Even though in air atmosphere, its HPR value still reaches 6339 μmol h‐1 g‐1 with good recyclability. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to the the enhanced polarity through the incoporation of strong polar sulfone or cyano groups in the COF frameworks, which brings about the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, high photocurrent intensity and low charge resistance as well as the increased surface hydrophilicity. The photocatalytic mechanism is studied by means of the theoretical calculations and comparative experiments conducted under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of the various scavengers for electron, hole, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical in the reaction system."

    "abstract": "Plastics are indispensable in daily life, with both production and waste generation increasing annually. As the world strives for net‐zero emissions, advancing plastic recycling technologies has become a global priority. Pyrolytic liquefaction is a promising approach for recovering chemical feedstocks, including fuel fractions, from waste plastics, potentially substituting petroleum resources. Since the 1970s, research on pyrolytic liquefaction has progressed globally, and several industrial‐scale plants are now in operation. However, to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it is crucial to bridge the knowledge gap between lab‐scale research and industrial‐scale implementation of pyrolysis‐liquefaction technologies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of plastic recycling, the progress and challenges in cutting‐edge lab‐scale research on pyrolytic liquefaction, alongside the latest trends in industrial‐scale liquefaction projects. It reveals that pyrolytic liquefaction of a wide range of plastics–including halogenated plastics and poly(ethylene terephthalate)–has been extensively studied at the laboratory level. In contrast, industrial‐scale operations often focus on more common, easily pyrolyzed plastics and generally avoid the use of catalysts. This highlights the urgent need to develop robust, reusable, and cost‐effective catalysts, as well as optimized process designs, to expand the range of plastic feedstocks suitable for industrial‐scale pyrolysis plants."

    "abstract": "Molecular metal complexes form an important class of catalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) or formic acid (HCOOH), key processes in the context of the requested exploration of novel sources of carbon, alternative to fossil fuels. Research studies are most generally carried out with pure gas streams of CO2, while the available real sources of CO2 are gases coming out from industrial plants and containing a low share of CO2, and a great diversity of impurities including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Here, we show that a molecular catalyst, [Rh(bpy)(Cp*)Cl]Cl (bpy = bipyridine, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), catalyzes CO2RR to formic acid using a quasi flue gas (5‐10% CO2 and 100 ppm NO2 or 50 ppm SO2) with substantial selectivity. This is made possible thanks to the modification of the cathode surface with a positively charged imidazolium layer, which greatly favors CO2RR over competing reactions, proton, NO2 and SO2 reductions. These results highlight the potential of combining molecular catalysis and electrode surface modification for electroreduction of diluted CO2 without prior carbon capture or purification."

The resulting composite exhibits significant surface area, of ~41 m2 g‐1, which is considerably higher than the electrides prepared by solid‐state synthesis. Upon loading with ruthenium, the BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C composite demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis, achieving rates of 3090 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 0.6Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C, and 3737 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 1.1Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C at mild reaction conditions (400 °C and 1 bar). Comprehensive characterization through XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and STEM‐EDS confirmed the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, while iodometric titration method and EPR analysis confirmed the electride‐like nature of the resulting composite.

However, the slow degradation of PLA in natural environments and contamination of recycling streams due to incompatibility with other plastics highlight the need for efficient recycling techniques. This study reports a sustainable closed‐loop PLA recycling strategy by hydrolysis depolymerization under moist‐solid condition and recovery of the valuable monomer lactic acid. By employing ball milling and resonance acoustic mixing, the effects of milling speed, time, ball size, alkali type, and ageing on lactate yield are investigated, to optimize the performance and the efficiency of mechanical and moist‐solid conditions in polymer chain scission without bulk heating is demonstrated. Furthermore, a bipolar membrane electrodialysis process for conversion of lactate to lactic acid is integrated with simultaneous NaOH production, enhancing the sustainability of the recycling process. Life‐cycle assessment (LCA) is employed to assess the environmental impact of such PLA recycling approach for lactic acid production and provide recommendations for future improvements. This work demonstrates the effectiveness and environmental benefits of mechanically induced moist‐solid chemical recycling and integration with advanced membrane separation processes, offering a promising pathway for sustainable PLA waste management and lactic acid production."

Liquid catalytic fuel cells (LCFCs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to utilize complex biomass fuels directly. However, conventional LCFCs face challenges related to the cross‐membrane permeation of catalysts, which leads to electrolyte imbalance and cell failure. To address the issue, this study proposed a novel LCFC system using the same catalyst, molybdovanadophosphoric heteropolyacid (PMoV), on both the anode and cathode, effectively mitigating catalyst permeation. Under ambient conditions, the PMoV‐LCFC system achieved a maximum power density of 3.39 mW cm−2 using glucose as the fuel, and the system demonstrated stable performance over five days. Notably, cyclic discharge tests using expired bread as fuel further show the system's effectiveness. The total organic carbon degradation rate reached a maximum of 23.36%, and formic acid was the primary intermediate. The PMoV‐LCFC system effectively reduced catalyst crossover and maintained stable electrochemical performance, offering new insights for designing biomass fuel cells and significantly contributing to waste management."

    "abstract": "The removal of molecular iodine (I2/I3−) from aqueous environments are of great importance due to their biological relevance and environmental concerns, particularly in nuclear waste management. In this work, we have demonstrated a hydrophobic tetrapodal receptor Se4Me‐PF6, that exhibits iodine adsorption from an aqueous phase via chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction. In the solution phase, NMR studies reveal that Se4Me‐PF6 selectively recognizes iodide (I−) over other anions. On the other hand, in the solid state, selenoimidazolium building units of Se4Me‐PF6 facilitate self‐assembly into a porous 1D supramolecular ChB framework, enabling efficient iodine adsorption. Consequently, Se4Me‐PF6 has propelled the rapid adsorption of iodine, with a high kinetic rate of 2.10 × 10−3 g·mg−1·min−1, while maintaining its effectiveness under competitive environmental conditions, including pH variations and the presence of interfering anions. Mechanistic investigations using XPS, and DFT studies indicate that iodine capture occurs via a combination of ChB interactions and electrostatic forces provided by the selenoimidazolium motifs. Importantly, Se4Me‐PF6 demonstrates its potential as a stationary phase for column‐based iodine removal, highlighting its applicability in real‐world scenarios. Thus, these findings offer a promising approach for developing iodine adsorbent materials."

Alkali metals, budget friendly and commonly used as additives to optimize the performance of Pt‐based alloy catalysts, are extensively utilized in the PDH industry. Herein, the structure and catalytic performance of the commercial catalyst (PtK2/θ‐Al2O3) and contrast samples (Pt0.3K0.8/θ‐Al2O3‐N and Pt0.3/θ‐Al2O3) are analyzed. According to the catalytic test, the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 exhibits better catalytic performance, which achieves >95% propylene selectivity and maintaining a high propane yield (>36%) during stability testing. Observations reveal that the initial propylene selectivity of the Pt‐based catalysts is inversely correlated with the total acidity and strong acid site content. The introducing of K element significantly reduces the acidity of the catalyst and enhances the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the presence of Cl−, co‐introduced with K, improves the catalytic stability, while the slight increase in the acidity of catalysts decreases the propylene selectivity. The enrichment of the electron density of PtK2 nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggest that lower propylene adsorption energy and higher barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation reaction on the PtK2‐(100) surface enhance the propylene selectivity of the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 catalyst."

Nevertheless, the leakage risk and inferior electrode compatibility impede their further application toward high‐performance SMBs. Herein, a novel DEE based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSi) and ethyl‐2‐cyano‐3‐ethoxyacrylate (ECE) is developed through their Lewis acid–base interaction and the further ECE‐based deep eutectic gel electrolyte (GE) is constructed with cross‐linked ploy(vinylene carbonate) (PVC) as matrix network. It is demonstrated that incorporating electron‐withdrawing PVC polymer into the ECE‐based DEE changes the coordination environment of Na+ ions, thus facilitating the Na‐ions desolvation and transport and leading to a high transference number of Na‐ions (0.7). Moreover, the strong interaction between PVC chains and Na‐ions can induce the preferential reduction of PVC to form O‐rich inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thus promoting the electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability with superior long‐term cycling stability. Benefiting from the stable SEI layer, the Na3V2(PO4)3//Na cell with GE displays outstanding cycling (capacity retention of 94.5% after 300 cycles at 1C) and rate (high capacity of 75.5 mAh g−1 at 2 °C) performance than that of ECE‐based DEE cell, showcasing the promising application of advanced deep eutectic GE in high performance SMBs."

This reaction is a route to glycolic acid, which is a key component of biodegradable packaging. Using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, EDX and XRD analysis, we find that a 3:1 Pd:Ag ratio gives optimal results. We show that the oxidation of ethylene glycol on palladium occurs between 0.3 and 1.2 V vs. RHE, and depends on the presence of a Pd(0) active site. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy experiments show that the charge‐transfer resistance (RCT) follows the same trend as EGOPd activity, with the 3:1 Pd:Ag electrode having the lowest RCT. Electrolysis with this electrode at 0.705 V vs. RHE, where Pd is reduced, results in glycolate production with no overoxidation to formate or oxalate. We then move to a flow setup under industrial conditions, and show that the Pd‐Ni electrode yields >80% FE to glycolate for over 140 h. Long‐term electrode deactivation can be overcome in this system by a periodic self‐refresh cycle."

The results showed that doping with Fe improved the recovery performance of biochar and the N-doping enhanced the activity of PMS. Simultaneously, it achieved a high degradation efficiency for TC (93%) under optimized conditions within 30 min. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments indicated that the main active radicals present in the experiment were SO4•− and •OH. Additionally, FeN-BC demonstrated good catalytic performance in the TC degradation process in a real water environment after five cycles. This work presents a practical strategy for preparing magnetic biochar to degrade organic pollutants from wastewater."

    "abstract": "Metalloporphyrins, owing to their structural resemblance to natural enzyme active sites and highly tunable coordination environments, have emerged as promising catalysts for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation."

In order to increase the yield of the finished product, develop porosity, and improve the sorption characteristics of the buckwheat husk, methods for its physical and chemical modification are proposed. The effect of the modification modes on the parameters of the porous structure, as well as the sorption capacity of the developed materials for various types of oil products, was studied. The selection of the optimal parameters of the buckwheat husk modification was carried out, ensuring the production of effective unsinkable sorbents based on the buckwheat husk with a reserve buoyancy of more than 20 days and a high sorption capacity of sorbents for oil of up to 6.1 g/g and waste motor oil of up to 4.9 g/g. The use of the buckwheat husk as a sorbent allows not only the elimination of oil pollution on both water and surfaces but also solving the problem of the disposal of agricultural waste."

    "abstract": "Although calcium phosphate bone cement has some advantages (it is easy to form, self-curing, and does not produce heat), some disadvantages remain that limit its clinical application. Therefore, the question of how we can modify CPC and further improve the various properties of calcium phosphate bone cement is a current research hotspot. In this paper, the preparation conditions and technology of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) were optimized; chitosan oligosaccharide (COSM) with MW ≤ 3000 Da was added to the optimal formulation of biphasic calcium phosphate cement particles, and its physical and chemical properties were characterized. The results showed that BCP bone cement carrier for clinical operations was successfully constructed by the high-temperature solid-state reaction method, and COSM-BCP bone cement particles were obtained by loading COSM drugs with an angiogenesis effect. Its formula is biphasic calcium phosphate powder with the molar ratio of α-TCP/β-TCP of 1. The curing time of the prepared BCP particles is 24 ± 1 min, the compressive strength is 29.58 ± 1.89 MPa, and the porosity reaches 52.09%. The loaded COSM can be released continuously and stably in vitro, and has the effect of promoting angiogenesis. The safety evaluation of COSM-BCP bone cement particles and the preliminary pharmacodynamic study of its angiogenesis in vitro provide a promising clinical application basis for the development of drug-loaded biological bone substitute materials."

    "abstract": "Investigating the adsorption properties of emulsifiers at water–oil interfaces enables advances in the comprehension of the mechanisms governing emulsion ageing and stabilization. The utilization of natural compounds in emulsion formulations is increasingly relevant for those applications where it is challenging to maintain a low impact on the environment and health. We report here a study on saponin and chitosan at the interface between water and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil in relation to the properties of the corresponding emulsions. Complementary experimental approaches have been adopted to investigate interfacial properties and emulsion evolution, relying on drop tensiometry, optical and confocal microscopy, and light transmission/scattering analysis. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation has been undertaken as support for the interpretation of the experimental results. The multi-technique investigation adopted here enabled a better understanding of saponin adsorption properties and of the role of chitosan in emulsion evolution. In particular, the results evidence the formation of amphiphilic saponin–chitosan complexes, which adsorb at the liquid–liquid interface and improve the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Since the system investigated mainly consists of natural compounds, the results of this work can contribute to the development of new and efficient low-impact formulations."

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are important acidic subcellular organelles whose dysfunction can lead to some related diseases. The development of new lysosome-imaging-guided AIEgens for the photodynamic therapy of cancer cells is important. In this work, two novel organic compounds with AIE characteristics, namely, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3, were designed and synthesized by introducing the weakly basic morpholinyl moiety with lysosome-targeting ability into a triphenylamine-based luminogen. The distorted spatial feature of TPA and the D1-D2-π-A structure of these AIEgens prevented the aggregation-caused quenching of traditional fluorescent molecules and efficiently promoted the separation of the HOMO and LUMO. The outcomes were AIE features and a narrow single-triplet energy gap. Furthermore, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3 showed bright yellow fluorescence emission peaks at 577 and 601 nm; large Stokes shifts of 234 and 256 nm, respectively; and excellent lysosome-targeted imaging of HeLa cells (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.90). In addition to the good 1O2-generation ability under light irradiation, these AIEgens achieved the high-efficiency bright lysosome imaging-guided photodynamic killing of cancer cells under white-light irradiation."

This study assessed the effects of ovophospholipids on lymphocyte subsets in non-immunized mice and on the humoral immune response in sheep red blood cells (SRBC)-immunized mice. Ovophospholipids were administered orally for 14 days (once a day) at doses of 100, 10, and 1 mg/kg. Ovophospholipids increased the total lymphocyte count of in the lymphoid organs. At 10 and 1 mg/kg, ovophospholipids increased the subsets of CD4−CD8− and CD4+CD8+ thymocytes but decreased the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. A stimulating effect on splenocytes was particularly evident 24 h after administration of the 10 and 1 mg/kg doses. Ovophospholipids also elevated the absolute counts of CD3+ and CD19+ splenocytes. An increase in the absolute count of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes of the mesenteric lymph nodes was observed 24 h after administration of the lowest dose. The increase in the percentage and absolute count of CD19+ cells and in the absolute count of CD3+ cells was still observed after 72 h. At all doses, ovophospholipids elevated the number of plaque-forming cells on day 4 and increased 2-mercaptoethanol-resistant antibody titer on day 7 after priming. In conclusion, ovophospholipids can modulate the immune response in mice."

    "abstract": "The overconsumption of fossil energy sources has resulted in serious environmental impacts and an ensuing energy crisis. Therefore, the search for a new alternative energy technology has become a focus of attention. The long-established Fischer–Tropsch synthesis technology and the recent CO2 hydrogenation technology with unlimited potential seem to be among the ways to solve the above problems. Among them, the development of efficient Fe-based catalysts has become a key issue. Weaker interactions on carbon supports are more favourable for the formation of active phases in Fe-based catalysts than stronger metal–support interactions on conventional oxide supports. In this work, we systematically summarise the application of various types of carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, graphene, activated carbon, etc.) in COx hydrogenation reactions. The effects of different structural types of carriers on the dispersion of active sites are discussed. At the same time, the effects of different carrier preparation methods on catalytic performance are compared. In addition, the role of surface modifications to carbon materials in the promotion of active sites is discussed. Finally, we propose possible research directions based on the current problems in these catalytic systems. The aim is to provide a reference for the development of new carbon materials and their application in COx hydrogenation."

    "abstract": "Indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Previous studies in airway smooth muscle demonstrated that chronic exposure to testosterone (TES, 40 nM) enhances the relaxation induced by salbutamol and theophylline due to K+ channel increment, without modifying cyclooxygenase expression. This study examines how indomethacin, ibuprofen, and ASA affect K+ currents and the relaxation response to these bronchodilators. In organ baths, tracheas from young male guinea pigs chronically (48 h) treated with 40 nM TES showed increased relaxation to salbutamol and theophylline, which was completely abolished by indomethacin. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that TES increased salbutamol- and theophylline-induced K+ currents, and only indomethacin fully inhibited this potentiation; ibuprofen and ASA had partial effects. The involved currents included voltage-dependent K+ (KV) and high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. Our results demonstrate that indomethacin exerts a dual action, inhibiting K+ channel activity and PG synthesis, unlike ibuprofen and ASA. This dual mechanism explains its stronger inhibitory effect on TES-enhanced ASM relaxation. These findings suggest that indomethacin may counteract the protective effects of TES, which promotes anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle-relaxing states. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution when prescribing indomethacin to young males with asthma, as the protective role of TES may diminish, potentially resulting in an exacerbation of asthma symptoms."

    "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials (CMs) have gained great attention as heterogeneous catalysts in water treatment because of their high efficiency and potential contribution to achieving carbon neutrality. Expanded graphite (EG) is ideal for studying CMs because the reactivity in CMs largely depends on graphitic structures, and most surface of EG is exposed, minimizing mass transfer resistance. However, EG is poor in adsorption and catalysis. In this study, EG was modified by simple thermal treatment to investigate the effects of characteristics of graphitic structures on reactivity. Tetracycline (TC) removal rate via activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) by the EG treated at 550 °C (EG550) was more than 10 times that of EG. The thermal modification did not significantly increase surfaces but led to increases in damaged, rough surfaces, graphitization degree, C content, defects, and C=O. Radical and non-radical pathways, such as SO4•−, O2•−, 1O2, and electron transfer, were involved in TC removal in EG550+PDS. TC degradation in EG550+PDS was initiated by hydroxylation, followed by demethylation, dehydroxylation, decarbonylation, and ring-opening. The ions ubiquitous in water systems did not significantly affect the performance of EG550+PDS, except for H2PO4− and HCO3−, suggesting the high potential of practical applications. This study demonstrated that graphitic structure itself and surface area are not detrimental in the catalytic reactivity of CMs, which is different from previous studies. Rather, the reactivity is governed by the characteristics, i.e., defects and functional groups of the graphitic structure. It is thought that this study provides valuable insights into the development of highly reactive CMs and the catalytic systems using them."

The main treatment for cancer is surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Since the outcomes of treatment are unsatisfactory, the search for more effective drugs is crucial. Our previous study indicated that mephedrone, a synthetic cathinone, reduced neuron and astrocyte viability and oligodendrocyte proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of mephedrone on selected human glioblastoma (LN-18, LN-229, T98G) and human anaplastic astrocytoma (MOGGCCM) cell lines. The effects of mephedrone on cell viability and proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression and the type of cell death were studied. Our results showed that mephedrone possesses potential anticancer activity. The viability and proliferation of all four human glioblastoma and human anaplastic astrocytoma cell lines used were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Studies conducted on LN-18 and T98G cells confirmed the significant antiproliferative properties of mephedrone, which reduced DNA synthesis and affected cell cycle progression. Microscopic evaluation supported the antiproliferative effect of the tested compounds. Moreover, substantial cytoplasmic vacuolization in the LN-18 cell line was revealed. This finding may indicate the potential of mephedrone in anticancer therapy."

Here, we demonstrate energy collection by CsPbI3 QDs from a near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting upconversion system. The upconversion system consists of Pd-tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(p-methoxycarbonylphenyl)-tetraanthraporphyrin (PdTAP) as the sensitizer to harvest NIR photons and rubrene as the annihilator to generate upconverted photons via triplet fusion. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra reveal that CsPbI3 QDs are energized via radiative energy transfer from the singlet excited rubrene with photophysics fidelity of respective components. In addition, a volumetric display demo incorporating CsPbI3 QDs as light emitters employing triplet fusion upconversion was developed, showing bright luminescent images from CsPbI3 QDs. These results present the feasibility of integrating organic light-harvesting systems and perovskite QDs, enabling diverse light harvesting and activation of perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications."

    "abstract": "In the natural environment, mechanical energy is widely available as a sustainable and green energy source. In this paper, we successfully convert mechanical energy on ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 tribocatalysts via a friction route. Electrons were transferred across the contact interface when the catalyst particles and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-sealed magnetic bar rubbed against each other under magnetic stirring. At the same time, holes were left on the catalyst while the PTFE absorbed the electrons. Similar to photocatalysis, organic pollutants can be effectively oxidized by the holes in the valence band of sol-gel catalysts due to their strong oxidative ability. The tribocatalytic tests demonstrated that ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 could eliminate organic analgesics (paracetamol) under magnetic stirring in the dark. By controlling the quantity of rare earth elements (1, 2, and 3 mol%), stirring speed, and the number of magnetic rods, we could further enhance the tribocatalytic performance. In addition to developing a green tribocatalysis approach for the oxidative purification of organic pollutants, this work offers a potential route for converting environmental mechanical energy into chemical energy, which could be used in sustainable energy and environmental remediation."

    "abstract": "With the worsening global water pollution crisis, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments. The effective removal of PPCPs remains challenging for conventional water treatment technologies, whereas photocatalytic technology has shown distinct promise. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a ubiquitous component of aquatic ecosystems, exerts multifaceted effects on the photocatalytic oxidation of PPCPs. In this article, the influence of DOM on the performance of various photocatalysts in PPCP removal is systematically summarized and analyzed. This review highlights DOM’s role in altering the migration and transformation of PPCPs via processes including adsorption and complexation. The adsorption of PPCPs on photocatalysts is achieved by competitive adsorption or by providing more adsorption sites. DOM modifies the structural properties of photocatalysts through mechanisms such as ligand exchange, intermolecular forces, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions. DOM inhibits the formation of active species via light attenuation and shielding effects while simultaneously enhancing their generation through photosensitization and electron transfer facilitation. In this review, the interaction mechanism among DOM, PPCPs, and photocatalysts within the PPCP photocatalytic oxidation system is expounded on. These findings provide novel insights into optimizing photocatalytic reaction conditions and enhancing treatment efficiency, while providing a theoretical foundation for advancing efficient, eco-friendly PPCPs remediation technologies."

    "abstract": "Carbon nanofibrous materials from electrospinning are good candidate electrode materials for supercapacitor applications due to their straightforward processability, chemical stability, high porosity, and large surface area. In this research, a straightforward and effective way was revealed to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon nanofibrous electrode material from electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Fluorination of the electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNF) was studied by comparing two types of hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment, i.e., direct HF acid treatment on ECNF (Type I) vs. HF acid treatment on the stabilized PAN (Type II) followed by carbonization. The latter was found to be an advantageous way to introduce C-F bonds in the resultant carbon nanofibrous electrode material that contributed to pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the Type II HF acid treatment demonstrated exciting synergistic effects with ECNF aerogel formation on carbon structure and porosity development and generated a superior fluorinated electrospun carbon nanofibrous aerogel (ECNA-F) electrode material for supercapacitor uses. The resultant ECNA-F electrode material demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with great cyclic stability due to the large improvements in both pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance. ECNA-F achieved a specific capacitance of 372 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, and the device with ECNA-F and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte possessed an energy density of 29.1 Wh/kg at a power density of 275 W/kg.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed the formation of stable physical crosslinks between CS and CMC via hydrogen bonding. These interactions significantly enhanced mechanical properties (tensile strength: 46.08 MPa; elongation at break: 68%), improved thermal stability (maximum decomposition temperature: 304 °C), and superior barrier properties (water vapor transmission rate: 0.26 × 10−5 g/(m2·h·Pa); oxygen transmission rate: 1.12 × 10−4 g/(m2·s)).

Our study investigates metalloporphyrins with central 3d-metals from Sc to Cu and chalcogen containing anchoring groups such as -SH, -SeH, and -TeH substituted at the meso-position of the porphyrin rings. We carried out Density Function Theory (DFT)-based calculations to determine the ground state geometry, spin multiplicity, spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals, and electronic structure descriptors to gain insights into the reactivity trends and possible impact on factors influencing electron transport properties. The results suggest that the central metal shapes the spin multiplicity, while variations between sulfur, selenium, and tellurium play a role in charge distribution. This study provides insights into how the selection of the central metal and control of spin channels influence the electronic structure and reactivity of metalloporphyrin molecules. The knowledge provided here can play a role in the design of porphyrin-based molecular materials for diverse applications in molecular junctions, catalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing."

SOD1 mutations have a significant role in the pathophysiology and fast behavior of protopathic proteins in ALS illness. The E100K mutation may be useful in uncovering the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1 associated with ALS. According to several studies, giving small molecule inhibitors made from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds may be a viable treatment strategy for neurological conditions. Using molecular docking and MD simulations, we have identified a potential flavonoid drug that may successfully inhibit SOD1’s amyloidogenic activity. Puerarin, Fisetin, and Peonidin provided intriguing pharmacological hints during the initial screening of flavonoids. The Fisetin-E100K complex had a larger residual energy contribution and substantial binding than other flavonoid compounds. The findings showed that, unlike other materials, Fisetin increased the structural stability, hydrophobicity, and flexibility of the mutant while reducing the amount of β-sheets. Furthermore, to distinguish aggregation in the mutant (unbound/bound) states, we displayed modifications in the free energy landscape (FEL). As a result, Fisetin was identified as having therapeutic potential against the E100K, which might make it a viable pharmacological option for the creation of inhibitors that lower the chance of ALS death."

Both C27** and C7 revealed their significant chemical reactivity after their optimization with B3LYP 6-31G (d, p) using the density functional theory (DFT), in addition to large similarities to the candidate drugs with desired pharmacokinetic and physicochemical features and good levels of molecular stability towards the crystal structure of human acetylcholinesterase protein (PDB ID of 4EY7)."

The parasitological, biochemical, and immunological activities of the compounds were measured. The screened compounds were subjected to molecular docking in the active site of CpCDPK1, in addition to analyses based on Lipinski’s rule and SwissADME. The results showed that compounds 5a, 5b, and 7b demonstrated promising antiparasitic activity, characterized by high gastrointestinal absorption and favorable drug-likeness profiles. Furthermore, 5a and 7b exhibited higher binding affinities than that of the reference drug. In practical assessments, compound 7b exhibited the highest percentage reduction in oocyst counts (67%).

In order to address the European Commission (EC) recycling targets, this study aimed to develop flexible Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) recycled-paper-based substrates tested by using a new eco-friendly and nontoxic molecule probe. This study reports for the first time the implementation of the microbial dye violacein, obtained by Janthinobacterium lividum batch cultivation, as SERS probe, as a suitable substitutive to the most employed toxic chemical dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). The interaction of the proposed natural probe with the metal surface after the adsorption and the presence of local electromagnetic fields were evaluated by computational approach. The SERS devices developed were decorated by applying a single-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) decoration method and characterized using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The platform showed a remarkable sensitivity, achieving a detection limit of 10–7 M for violacein, allowing to point out the strong potential of this natural microbial dye as a sustainable probe molecule for low-concentration analytes detection on SERS-active substrates, making them suitable for several application fields, such as environmental monitoring, food safety, cultural heritage analysis and diagnostics. This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing eco-friendly materials in the development of chemical sensors as a sustainable innovation in environmental science by minimizing the ecological impact."

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation plays a pivotal role in human semen, influencing various processes, such as spermatogenesis, maturation, sperm motility, capacitation, and fertilization. Despite its importance, the specific details regarding N/O-glycosylation within human semen proteins have largely remained unknown. To address this challenge, an integrated glycoproteomic platform (termed GlycoIP) was developed, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both intact N- and O-glycopeptides directly from human semen samples. Characterizing these intact glycopeptides is particularly challenging, yet it provides invaluable insights into the structure and function of both glycans and their attachment sites. In this study, our platform enabled the identification of 1,833 unique N-glycopeptides and 720 unique O-glycopeptides. This approach revealed extensive and precise site-specific N/O-glycosylation data, highlighting 438 potential O-glycosylation sites from 148 distinct O-glycoproteins. Notably, we conducted site-specific N/O-glycosylation profiling on several unique glycoproteins, including sperm equatorial segment protein 1 (SPESP1), which is located on human sperm, and plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), which is presented in both sperm and seminal plasma. In summary, this platform provides a promising approach for comprehensive profiling of protein site-specific N/O-glycosylation within a single experiment. This advancement paves the way for further functional studies on glycoproteins and their roles in male infertility, enhancing our understanding of this complex field."

    "abstract": "In situ microemulsion has emerged as an advanced tertiary oil recovery technique that utilizes the injection of surfactant solutions to improve displacement efficiency through spontaneous microemulsification. This study presents a novel pore-scale numerical model to simulate the dynamic process of in situ microemulsion formation during surfactant-cosolvent-salt flooding in complex porous media. Through comprehensive numerical simulations based on realistic rock geometries, we systematically investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of phase distributions and identified critical mechanisms governing oil mobilization. The developed model incorporates four fundamental characteristics of microemulsion systems: interfacial tension reduction, viscosity modification, wettability alteration, and enhanced solubilization capacity. During the microemulsion-forming surfactant flooding in a realistic rock medium, the in situ formed microemulsion was observed at the interface between oil and aqueous. The in situ microemulsion flooding can significantly improve the recovery rate under the combined effect of multiple factors. Increasing the viscosity of the in situ formed microemulsion can enhance the oil recovery during the microemulsion-forming surfactant flooding in the complex porous media. Under water-wet conditions, the oil-water interface stays at the junction of the throat and the pore space, which contributes to the formation of microemulsions and thus to the enhancement of recovery. This study provides a better understanding of the in situ microemulsion formation and the mechanisms of enhanced oil recovery in complex porous media."

    "abstract": "IntroductionAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates for combating multidrug-resistant infections, but their clinical application is often limited by challenges such as poor selectivity and high cytotoxicity. This study aimed to optimize the therapeutic potential of brevinin-1pl, a frog-derived AMP with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities.MethodsMajor experimental approaches encompassed antibacterial activity evaluation, hemolytic potential assessment, bactericidal rate determination via time-kill kinetics, SYTOX Green-based membrane integrity analysis, and MTT assays for anti-proliferative effects.ResultsSubstitutions with arginine (brevinin-1pl-2R and brevinin-1pl-5R) enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria but reduced efficacy against Gram-negative strains. Lysine substitution (brevinin-1pl-6K) decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria due to reduced hydrophobicity. In contrast, histidine substitution (brevinin-1pl-3H) showed diminished activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., MRSA MIC increased from 2 µM to 4 µM) but reduced hemolysis, indicating improved selectivity. Mechanistic studies using SYTOX green assays confirmed membrane disruption as a primary mode of action, while suggesting alternative mechanisms for Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The brevinin-1pl and its analogues demonstrated significant inhibitory efficacy against both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and H838 non-small cell lung cancer cells at a concentration of 10–4 M. Notably, brevinin-1pl-3H exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal HaCaT cells despite its high hydrophobicity, suggesting potential for dermatological applications.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that strategic amino acid substitutions can optimize the therapeutic potential of AMPs, offering a promising approach to develop peptides with enhanced efficacy and reduced clinical side effects."

    "abstract": "IntroductionUnderground coal gasification (UCG) faces challenges in product quality control and combustion stability. While microwave heating enhances coal seam heat/mass transfer efficiency, existing studies prioritize focused microwaves, overlooking non-focusing radiation.MethodsTwo microwave systems were used to treat coal in this paper. Gasification experiments were conducted on the treated coal. Meanwhile, its microscopic properties were tested by industrial analysis, mercury pressure method and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method.ResultsFirstly, non-focusing microwaves achieve more stable gasification despite comparable gas production durations. Secondly, focused microwaves enhance energy absorption and reduce coal moisture, while non-focusing radiation alters coal composition by increasing volatile matter and decreasing fixed carbon. Finally, non-focusing modes improve coal combustibility and reduce particulate emissions with minimal environmental impact, contrasting with focused microwaves limited ecological effects. Both methods similarly reduce coal porosity and pore volume.DiscussionThis work compares gasification performance and physicochemical changes under both modalities, revealing three critical differences. These results provide critical insights for optimizing microwave-assisted UCG systems."

    "abstract": "The study of how energy undergoes changes in physio-chemical interactions involving Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 with water and C2H6O2 within converging and diverging channels is of great significance, given its potential applications in today’s advanced technology. We have used two types of oxide nanoparticles, namely, Al2O3 and γ- Al2O3, with water and C2H6O2. The purpose of this study is to investigate an innovative comparative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid flow and heat transport with the impact of thermal radiation on water and ethylene glycol (EG) suspended with Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. A novel comparison of concentration of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ Al2O3–C2H6O2 nanofluids is investigated under the influence of chemical reactions. The system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was obtained via a similarity transformation and then solved using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) in Mathematica. The temperature and velocity profiles are obtained numerically for a range of controlling parameter values, including the volume percentage φ of nanomaterials, the magnetic effect parameter M, the radiation parameter Rd, and Eckert number Ec in convergent/divergent channels. The concentration profiles of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 tri-nanofluids are calculated numerically for governing parameter values, including those accounting for chemical reactions. The investigation’s findings indicate that there is greater heat transport in γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 and γ-Al2O3–H2O than in Al2O3–H2O. We have demonstrated that there is good agreement between the current results and those found in the literature for various values of the magnetic field parameter, thermal radiation parameter, and nanoparticle volume fraction."

    "abstract": "Trifluoromethylation stands as a pivotal technology in modern synthetic chemistry, playing an indispensable role in drug design, functional material development, and agrochemical innovation. With the growing emphasis on green chemistry principles, the pursuit of environmentally benign trifluoromethylation strategies has emerged as a critical research frontier. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), characterized by its cost-effectiveness, stability, and low toxicity, has become a promising alternative to conventional trifluoromethylation reagents. This review systematically summarizes advancements in photocatalytic decarboxylative trifluoromethylation using TFA and its derivatives over the past decade, focusing on three key activation mechanisms: single-electron transfer (SET), electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-mediated pathways, and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This paradigm shift is driven by the intrinsic limitations of conventional thermal decarboxylation, particularly its reliance on harsh conditions and significant environmental burdens. In contrast, photocatalytic strategies enable efficient C–CF3 bond construction under mild conditions, offering a modular platform for synthesizing fluorinated functional molecules. Strategic research priorities should focus on overcoming fundamental challenges, including but not limited to optimizing photosensitizer catalytic efficiency, establishing regioselective manipulation strategies, and engineering multicomponent tandem reaction systems to achieve trifluoromethylation methodologies under mild conditions. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic investigations with artificial intelligence-driven reaction prediction will accelerate the advancement of precision trifluoromethylation technologies. This progress is anticipated to provide sustainable synthetic solutions for next-generation fluorinated pharmaceuticals and advanced functional materials, effectively bridging the innovation gap between academic research and industrial implementation."

The resulting series (4a–c to 9a–c) was evaluated for antihypertensive and calcium channel-blocking activities in male and female rats, administered intraperitoneally. Among the synthesized compounds, the ortho-substituted derivatives (4a, 7a, 8a, and 9a) demonstrated the highest antihypertensive activity, exhibiting approximately 30% efficacy relative to nifedipine. These compounds also displayed IC50 values comparable to nifedipine and were further assessed for binding affinity with 6M7H and 4MS2 through molecular docking studies. The final DHP derivatives were amides, synthesized through reactions with aniline, 4-methylaniline, and 4-nitroaniline. Notably, compound 9a exhibited the highest docking score against both tested receptor proteins, highlighting its potential for further investigation."

    "abstract": "Today, wastewater treatment is essential and inevitable due to the water crisis caused by climate change and population growth. Although numerous methods and synthetic compounds have been successful in practical and laboratory applications, developing novel multifunctional compounds remains of interest to scientists. For this purpose, a new nanofiber containing Cobalt-MOF (metal-organic framework), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which are known environmentally friendly polymers, was synthesized. After characterization and structure determination, the nanofiber was investigated for its ability to adsorb Congo Red dye and inhibit known microbial species in wastewater. This study showed that 91% of the 400 mg/L Congo red solution was absorbed by 0.06 g/L of the synthesized Cobalt-MOF/PVA-PVP Nanofibers at 1 h. Additionally, seven well-known strains (including Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Giardia lamblia) in wastewater were inhibited (with MIC of 8 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL) to the extent that some antibiotics could not affect them. This performance of the newly synthesized nanofiber can be attributed to its physical, chemical, and structural characteristics, such as compounds with biological properties present in its structure, as well as its high specific surface area. Therefore, researching and synthesizing similar compounds using the method presented in this study can lead to their development and application in wastewater treatment processes."

However, full agonists such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have limitations in terms of side effects. Selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARγMs) that target alternative binding pockets offer the potential for safer partial agonists. Here, we employed six computational algorithms (Fpocket, DeepSite, CavityPlus, DoGSiteScorer, CASTpFold, POCASA) to identify a novel allosteric pocket (pocket 6–5) in the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD), localized at the helix 3 (H3), helix 2 (H2), helix 2'(H2′), and β-sheet interface. A virtual screening of 4,097 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) libraries was conducted, which led to the identification of ginsenoside Rg5 (TWSZ-5) as a top hit. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) dynamics revealed TWSZ-5 stabilizes pocket 6–5 through hydrogen bonds with Ser342, Gln345, Lys261, and Lys263. TWSZ-5 promoted beige adipocyte differentiation in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in vitro, upregulating Ucp1, Prdm16, Cpt1α, and Pgc1α. The present study identifies TWSZ-5 as a novel SPPARγM that utilizes an allosteric binding pocket to enhance thermogenesis while mitigating adverse effects. These findings emphasize the potential of TCM derivatives and structure-based screening strategies to develop safer antidiabetic therapies with precision pharmacology."

    "abstract": "The development of highly efficient, recyclable adsorbents for heavy metal remediation remains a critical challenge in environmental engineering. This study introduces a novel cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized magnesium silicate (CTAB/MS) nano-adsorbent was synthesized through a multi-step surface modification of serpentinite involving intercalation with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol treatment, and CTAB incorporation. The resulting nanostructure was extensively characterized and applied for the removal of cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), and copper (Cu2+) ions from contaminated water. The characterization findings confirmed significant morphological and structural modifications, including enhanced surface area, functional group availability, and mesoporosity, which contributed to enhanced adsorption performance. The kinetic modeling confirmed that the process predominantly followed a pseudo-first-order model, suggesting that rapid physisorption mechanisms controlled the initial adsorption phase. Equilibrium studies revealed that adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous active sites, with maximum adsorption capacities of 491.9 mg/g (Cd2+), 481.8 mg/g (Co2+), and 434.3 mg/g (Cu2+) at 303 K. Furthermore, statistical physics-based isotherm model incorporating steric and energetic parameters provided deeper mechanistic insights. The adsorption energy (ΔE) values remained below 12.66 kJ/mol, confirming a predominantly physical adsorption process, while thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic and spontaneous nature, as evidenced by negative free enthalpy (G) and internal energy (Eint) values. The recyclability assessment demonstrated that CTAB/MS retained over 70% of its adsorption efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles, underscoring its long-term applicability in water treatment. This highlights the potential of CTAB/MS as an advanced, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for large-scale water purification."

Hedysari Radix (HR) was categorized under the AR entry in ‘SHENNONG BENCAO JING’. HR is still an alternative to AR paired with CR clinically in northwest China. Hedysari Radix Praeparata Cum Melle (HRPCM) is a product that HR fries with honey to enhance the therapeutic effect. However, the mechanism of HRPCM paired with CR (HRCR) in CAC needs to be further elucidated.MethodsHRCR-MIAS were prepared using the eversion intestinal sac method. UHPLC Q-Exactive-MS investigated the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. Then, the mechanism of HRCR in CAC mice was predicted based on network pharmacology analysis in combination with the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. The pharmacodynamic effects of HRCR-MIAS for SW620 colon cancer cells were invested in vitro. The efficacies of HRCR low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (HRCR-L, 3.413 g/kg; HRCR-M, 6.825 g/kg; HRCR-H, 13.650 g/kg) in CAC mice were explored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to assay The inflammatory factors levels, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum. The expressions of the intestinal permeability proteins, such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1, were detected via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Finally, the predicted signalling was verified by Western blot (WB).Results855 common components were identified in HRCR and HRCR-MIAS, and 25 specific components in HRCR-MIAS were pointed out. Based on network pharmacology analysis, the inflammatory response and the cross-linked MAPK signalling and NF-kB signalling were predicted to be the main reasons for HRCR in CAC. HRCR-MIAS inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, regulated the cell cycle progression, and restrained the SW620 cells’ ability to migrate and invade in vitro. The outcomes of the WB experiment exhibited that HRCR-MIAS inhibited the expression of key proteins such as MEKK1, RAS, ERK, IKB and NF-kB in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling pathway of SW620 cells. The study in vivo found that the different doses of HRCR recovered the loss of body weight, the shortened colon length, the increased tumour counts, the abnormal changes in spleen and thymus indices, the colonic lesions, the unbalanced inflammatory factors levels like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, and the down-regulated intestinal permeability proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Experimental validation by WB confirmed that HRCR inhibited the expression of the key proteins, including MEKK1 RAS, ERK, IKB, and NF-kB, in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling in CAC mice.DiscussionHRCR not only suppresses the process of colonic inflammation and improves intestinal permeability but also relieves CAC by inhibiting the activated MAPK/NF-kB signalling cascade to alleviate CAC."

Studies have demonstrated that CatS plays a pivotal role in antigen presentation and is associated with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity, positioning it as a potential target in related disorders. Consequently, the development of a selective and straightforward method for detecting CatS is crucial. In this study, we introduce a colorimetric approach utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and CatS‐specific peptides for the detection of CatS activity. The CatS enzyme cleavage peptides, PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2, can stabilize AuNPs in a hydrosaline solution without aggregation. Upon hydrolysis of PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 by CatS, the AuNPs aggregate with a color change from red to blue. After optimizing the size of the AuNPs and the concentration of the peptides, the limits of detection for CatS were both to be 10 nM, when PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 were used to protect the AuNPs. Therefore, this colorimetric assay, which employs peptides and AuNPs, enables not only a selective but also a simple detection of CatS, visible to the naked eye."

Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have emerged as market leaders in numerous sectors, including consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and the integration of renewable energy sources. When compared to other rechargeable battery types, LIBs have a greater energy‐to‐volume ratio, surpassing even nickel‐metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. Although LIBs' green revolution is in its infancy, it might prove to be a game‐changer in the battle against global warming. Because of this, they are suitable for incorporation in mobile devices, which often prioritize their portability and lightweight design. Therefore, important aspects of this review study have been emphasized, including, the LIBs eco‐innovative advancements, environmental implications, life cycle evaluation, recycling, and potential future research to mitigate these impacts. Since clean energy can replace power from fossil fuels, the future studies will undoubtedly focus on the environmental acceptability and sustainability of LIBs."

However, their highly symmetric structures and localized aromaticity typically result in low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we incorporate a perylene unit into the kekulene framework and synthesize a π‐extended kekulene derivative (1) via macrocy‐clization using Suzuki coupling, followed by bismuth(III) triflate‐catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ethers. X‐ray crystallography reveals a slightly distorted extended kekulene backbone, while peripheral aryl substituents effectively suppress intermolecular π–π stacking. Notably, 1 retains the frontier molecular orbital characteristics of perylene and exhibits high oscillator strengths for frontier electronic transitions, achieving a PLQY of up to 60% in solution."

    "abstract": "AbstractEnveloped viruses utilize membrane fusion to enter the host cell and cause viral diseases. Most conventional inhibitors are target‐specific and ineffective against broad‐spectrum viral infections. Therefore, the current scenario demands developing inhibitors to attenuate the membrane properties instead of targeting the viral proteins. In the present work, we have designed a new WD‐containing peptide (dmTG‐23) by introducing a WD repeat at the center of the peptide sequence using mTG‐23 peptide as a template and a 14‐amino acid peptide with seven WD repeats (WD‐14), and tested their efficacies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐induced fusion assay. Our findings show that both dmTG‐23 and WD‐14 prevent PEG‐induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol concentrations, with a higher effect for dmTG‐23. Moreover, we have compared our results with our previous observations on TG‐23 and mTG‐23 to evaluate the importance of the number and position of WD repeats in the peptide sequence to impart the highest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that three WD repeat‐containing dmTG‐23 shows the highest efficacy against the PEG‐induced fusion of SUVs by enhancing the membrane order at the acyl chain region. This result is significantly important in designing peptide‐based broad‐spectrum fusion inhibitors."

It was shown that a larger strong Brønsted acidity enhanced the total aromatics formation with an increased light arenes content (especially at elevated WHSV). At low WHSV, excess Brønsted acidity leads to the declined aromatics yield due to its high cracking ability. On the contrary, a higher Lewis acidity and extensive mesoporosity promoted the heavier aromatics production accelerating the coke formation and shortening the catalyst lifetime. An improved aromatization performance and a prolonged durability of the zeolite catalyst were controlled by a balanced Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio and the ratio of WHSV to acid site concentration."

The precise manipulation and elimination of these detrimental defects are particularly crucial for improving the photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) reaction, though this remains a considerable challenge. In a recent study, Wang and colleagues introduced an innovative “in‐situ salt flux” copolymerization technique to synthesize poly(triazine imide) (PTI) with high crystallinity and minimal defects. This approach resulted in a record apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 37.8% at 380 nm. This strategy effectively balances the impact of two types of vacancies (carbon and nitrogen) on OWS performance and establishes clear structure‐property‐activity relationships for the photocatalytic OWS process."

    "abstract": "AbstractEnantioenriched propargylic and allenic derivatives of silicon, germanium, and tin are versatile building blocks for stereoselective synthesis. Consequently, considerable efforts toward their efficient and selective synthesis have been made, both through classical approaches for chirality transfer and catalytic enantioselective strategies that employ the latest developments in transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and photoredox catalysis. In this review, we survey broadly applicable synthetic strategies and discuss the scope and mechanistic details for specific protocols that afford these compounds in a regio‐ and stereoselective manner."

    "abstract": "AbstractTo elucidate the emergence and amplification of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral molecules and their assemblies, we designed positionally isomeric chiral V‐shaped Schiff base ligands and their corresponding bis(boron difluoride) complexes. The ligands were synthesized by condensing chiral cyclohexanediamine with either 1‐hydroxy‐2‐naphthaldehyde or 2‐hydroxy‐1‐naphthaldehyde, followed by complexation with boron difluoride (BF2) to yield CNB1 and CNB2, respectively. While the parent Schiff bases exhibited no CPL, BF2 coordination induced strong CPL signals in solution. Remarkably, upon aggregation in a mixed solvent system, CNB2 displayed enhanced and inverted CPL, whereas its isomer CNB1 showed attenuated emission. Through comprehensive characterization and singlecrystal analysis, we attribute this divergent behavior to distinct molecular packing modes: CNB2 forms tightly stacked aggregates with efficient π─π interactions, while CNB1 adopts a less ordered arrangement. This study establishes a clear correlation between subtle structural modifications, supramolecular packing, and CPL performance, offering a rational strategy for tailoring chiroptical properties through precise molecular design and controlled self‐assembly."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe growing global population and rising demand for pharmaceuticals highlight the need for efficient drug synthesis and detection methods. This study presents a bifunctional imidazole‐functionalized Hf(IV)‐based metal–organic framework (MOF), 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesizing 1,4‐dihydropyridines (1,4‐DHPs), which are key moieties in the synthesis of drugs used for cardiovascular treatments. The solvent‐free activated form of 1, labeled as 1′ catalyzes both Biginelli and Hantzsch reactions under mild conditions. The Biginelli reaction using aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea proceeded at 80 °C in 0.5 h with a 99% yield, while the Hantzsch reaction with aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate occurred at room temperature in ethanol within 1 h, also achieving a 99% yield. Compound 1′ showed broad substrate compatibility in both reactions. Additionally, the MOF exhibited excellent sensing ability for the anticancer drug raloxifene (RLX), showing a fast turn‐off fluorescence response (within 5 s), a low detection limit (9 nM), and a high Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv, 2 × 106 M⁻¹), enabling sensitive detection in diverse environments, including wastewater and biofluids. Detailed investigations into catalytic mechanisms and detection capabilities provide valuable insights for advancing drug synthesis and analytical methodologies. The study provides valuable insights into both the catalytic and sensing capabilities of 1′, demonstrating its potential for advanced pharmaceutical synthesis and real‐time drug monitoring."

In this study, we introduce N‐confused porphyrin (NCP) as a highly active ligand scaffold for transition metal‐based catalysts in CO2 reduction reactions. By breaking the D4h symmetry inherent in conventional porphyrin structures, NCP promotes enhanced electron delocalization around corresponding metal complex, improving the catalytic efficiency. A comprehensive study demonstrates that NCP‐based metal complexes (Fe, Co, and Ni) significantly outperform their parent metal‐porphyrin counterparts. These results provide new insights into the design of more effective catalysts for CO2 reduction."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe increasing demand for green and clean energy harvesting and their judicious storage call for pursuing new energy storage technologies. Building better batteries has drawn significant attention to fulfilling the energy demand by delivering the stored electrical energy at the anticipated time and minimal cost. Li‐ion batteries play a crucial role in transitioning to a sustainable energy landscape. However, their safety and environmental issues are of concern. Zn‐based batteries provide more sustainable solutions due to their low cost, enhanced safety, and environmental benignity. Still, poor thermodynamic reversibility and stability of Zn anode in the aqueous electrolytes prevent its practical application. Significant efforts such as Zn anode surface engineering and electrolyte and/or interface modification alleviate these issues. However, in‐depth studies of the root causes associated with the reversibility and stability issues of Zn electrodes are still deficient. Hence, this review focuses on the underlying causes of the major issues (dendrite, hydrogen evolution, corrosion, and passivation) associated with Zn anodes. Furthermore, we have summarized the technological advances that have been made to address these issues. Finally, some promising future directions and perspectives are provided for a further in‐depth understanding of thermodynamic irreversibility and to improve the overall performance of the Zn anode."

    "abstract": "AbstractAdsorption of silver ions onto natural biopolymers like cellulose offers dual benefits: (i) recovery of precious metals from waste and (ii) application as antibacterial agents, including water treatment. In this work, cellulose is derivatized with a thiol‐containing amino acid, cysteine, via two approaches to enhance silver anchoring by exploiting the high affinity between thiol groups and soft metals. The first method involves direct esterification to produce Cel‐Cys‐Est, while the second uses periodate oxidation to form dialdehyde cellulose (DAC), followed by linking with cysteine via a Schiff base reaction, creating DAC‐Cys. After confirming the successful cysteine derivatization using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the adsorption characteristics towards silver ions have been optimized for parameters like pH, adsorbent dosage, and ion concentration. The kinetic studies have shown the pseudo‐second‐order model for silver ion adsorption over both materials, while the isotherm studies have indicated Langmuir‐type monolayer adsorption. The silver‐loaded DAC‐Cys, having higher adsorption capacity, has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work highlights the versatility of cysteine‐derivatized cellulose as an effective, eco‐friendly material for silver ion sequestration and its promising application in antimicrobial domains."

Notably, the dendritic Zn(II) complex demonstrated significantly enhanced gelation capabilities compared to their ligand precursors, achieving gel formation in various organic solvents at remarkably low critical gelation concentrations. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the formation of stable metallogels is facilitated by a synergistic combination of multiple noncovalent interactions, including Zn(II)‐hydrazide coordination, solvophobic effects, and π─π stacking interactions. These dendritic metallogels exhibited intelligent stimuli‐responsive behavior, undergoing reversible gel–sol phase transitions in response to various external stimuli, such as temperature and chemical inputs. Furthermore, the dendritic metallogel, particularly in its xerogel form, demonstrated exceptional efficacy (>94% within 10 hours) and outstanding adsorption capacity (800 mg/g) in the removal of Hg2⁺ ions from aqueous solutions, highlighting its potential for environmental remediation applications."

Here, we present a simple, universal method for constructing metal nanoparticle (MNP) microarray electrodes—Au, Ag, and Pd—via in situ reduction on polydopamine (PDA) microarrays patterned by microcontact printing (µCP). Because each microdisk allows for nearly independent spherical diffusion, the system benefits from significantly enhanced mass transport conditions. Using AuNPs microdisk array electrodes, nitrite determination was achieved, which demonstrates a 4‐fold enhancement in current density and improved sensitivity (LOD = 2.5 µM) compared to conventional randomly modified electrodes. The sensor also demonstrated successful detection of nitrite in real food samples. This versatile platform allows tunable array geometry and composition, offering broad potential for electroanalytical and electrocatalytic applications."

The series of CNTTs was combined with a [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4‐e]thieno[2'',3'':4',5']thieno[2',3':4,5]pyrrolo[3,2‐g]thieno[2',3':4,5]thieno[3,2‐b]indole (BTP) unit, the electron‐donating core of Y6, a representative NFA, to afford a series of NFAs (BTP‐CNTTs). The BTP‐CNTTs, particularly the ones with α‐chlorinated or brominated CNTT units, exhibit longer absorption wavelengths than that of Y6 and have low‐lying LUMO energy levels comparable to that of Y6. Bulk heterojunction OPV devices based on the BTP‐CNTTs blended with a representative donor polymer, PBDB‐T, exhibited power conversion efficiencies of over 10% under AM1.5 irradiation. These results suggest that the CNTTs are good candidates as electron acceptor building units for NFAs or n‐type organic semiconductors."
