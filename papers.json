    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest owing to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The development of [2 + 2] cyclases containing benzophenone triplet sensitizers highlights the potential of engineered enzymes as a platform for stereocontrolled energy transfer photocatalysis. However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (k\n            cat = 13 s−1, >1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As reactive intermediates and substructures of natural products and bioactive molecules, the smallest cyclic alkanes—cyclopropanes—are an attractive class of molecules for chemists. Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Engineered polyketide synthases (PKSs) have great potential as biocatalysts. These unnatural enzymes are capable of synthesizing molecules that are either not amenable to biosynthesis or are extremely challenging to access chemically. PKSs can thus be a powerful platform to expand the chemical landscape beyond the limits of conventional metabolic engineering. Here we employ a retrobiosynthesis approach to design and construct PKSs to produce δ-valerolactam (VL) and three enantiopure α-substituted VL analogues that have no known biosynthetic route. We introduce the engineered PKSs and pathways for various malonyl-CoA derivatives into Pseudomonas putida and use proteomics, metabolomics and culture condition optimization to improve the production of our target compounds. These α-substituted VLs are polymerized into polyamides (nylon-5) or converted into their N-acryloyl derivatives. RAFT polymerization produces bio-derived polymers with potential biomedical applications. Overall, this interdisciplinary effort highlights the versatility and effectiveness of a PKS-based retrobiosynthesis approach in exploring and developing innovative biomaterials."

The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)─O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high‐value‐added chemical feedstocks. Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)─O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)─O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging. This research advances the development of heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts as an option to enable organic transformations that have not yet been achieved using homogeneous catalysts."

In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]‐fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar = Ar*, Tbb).

    "abstract": "AbstractHere, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono‐ or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals."

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as‐formed ROS by introducing Au SAs on CuOx/ZnO (Au1‐CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1‐CuOx/ZnO‐*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2‐pz and dxz/dyz‐px. This facilitated the dissociation of O−O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1‐CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C−H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4. Thus, Au1‐CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856 μmol·gcat.−1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions."

This ambient‐temperature approach significantly reduces aggregation, enhancing the exposure of catalytic active sites and delivering superior multi‐enzyme‐like activities (catalase, peroxidase, oxidase).

    "abstract": "Developing new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) skeletons with narrowband emission is crucial for advancing ultra‐high‐definition displays. Inspired by the aesthetic configuration of negatively curved octagonal rings and the multiple resonance (MR) effect, we designed a novel diaza‐octagon heterocycle fused with PAHs, abbreviated as 8NN, and its phenyl‐substituted derivative 8NNP. Crystal data and theoretical calculations show that their peripheral PAHs exhibit significant rigidity, while the internal diaza‐octagon ring confers skeleton flexibility and flipping properties. Notably, owing to the strategic embedding and unique bonding form of nitrogen atoms, their MR effect is significantly enhanced. Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep‐blue emission peaking at 408 nm and 411 nm, with remarkably narrow full‐width at half‐maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm and 17 nm, respectively, and aggregation‐enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron‐functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461 nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31 nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively.

    "abstract": "Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (~4200 mAh g⁻¹). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion (~300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in‐situ conversed MgF₂ layer (with coating integrity of 94.6%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF₂ layer is in‐situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF₂‐1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000 mAh g⁻¹ at 10 C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9 mAh g‐1 after 500 cycles). Full‐cell based on the Si@MgF₂‐1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF‐rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon‐based LIBs."

However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(μ‐N2)Sr(BDI) with a side‐on bridging N22− dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI* = HC[(Me)C = N‐DIPeP]2, DIPeP = 2,6‐Et2CH‐phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6‐Sr); DIPePNN = DIPePN‐Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2‐NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6‐Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22− anion with side‐on bonding to Ae2+ and end‐on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms‐In‐Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6‐Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae = Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6‐Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon‐soluble reducing agents."

In a Cu(II)‐pyrazolate framework, BUT‐64(H2O), the bridging water molecules between adjacent Cu(II) ions serve as Brønsted acid sites to hydrate ammonia, achieving a remarkable NH3 packing density of 0.27 g cm−3 at 0.1 kPa and an adsorption capacity of 1.51 mmol g−1 for 1000 ppm NH3 under 80% relative humidity, among the leading adsorbents. The reversible hydration mechanism combines enhanced NH3 affinity with facile regeneration and mitigated moisture co‐adsorption, overcoming the inherent trade‐off.

In this work, H2 and N2 activation mediated by a diuranium complex was studied from a nonadiabatic perspective using multi−configurational ab initio calculations combined with density functional theory. Stepwise electron transfer during the reaction enhances degeneracy between electronic states, enabling state‐to‐state transitions, i.e., spin downshift. The dual functionality of transition states acting as thermodynamic gateways and channels for nonadiabatic transitions was disclosed. The π and σ cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation. Bonding analysis reveals that U5f/6d orbitals mixing with H1s/N2p orbitals afford some degree of covalency to the primarily ionic U‐H/N interactions, with the 6d‐orbitals contributing more pronounced than the 5f‐orbitals in σ interactions, while the U‐N π bonding exhibits significant U5f contributions."

    "abstract": "AbstractScintillators featuring bright and fast‐response properties are essential for high‐speed and dynamic X‐ray imaging. Nevertheless, simultaneously possessing high light yields and fast‐response remains a significant challenge for most scintillators. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve the bright and fast‐response characteristics of scintillators by leveraging the combined effects of dielectric and molecular confinement in organic–inorganic hybrid scintillators (TPA)2MnBr4. Thereinto, large tetrapropylammonium cations (TPA+) surround [MnBr4]2− units, forming a zero‐dimensional (0D) molecular confinement structure that promotes electron localization and achieves a notable light yield of 56800 photons MeV−1. Meanwhile, the low dielectric constant of TPA+ can enhance dielectric confinement of [MnBr4]2− units, mitigating exciton capture by deep defects. These synergistic effects in the scintillators lead to a large exciton binding energy of 1028.8 meV and an ultrafast response time of 500 fs. Notably, under the irradiation of X‐rays, (TPA)2MnBr4 exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 18.7 nGyair s−1 and an exceptional spatial resolution of 21.0 lp mm−1. Given the bright and fast‐response features of scintillators, we demonstrate the potential applications in 3D dynamic and real‐time X‐ray imaging. These findings lay the groundwork for designing high‐performance scintillators and open avenues for innovative applications in high‐resolution and dynamic imaging."

Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a co‐reactant, with the goal of achieving high‐yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 °C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low‐density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt % of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9‐C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope‐labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation‐mediated C‐C bond cleavage and self‐amplifying Friedel–Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway towards the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry."

    "abstract": "G‐quadruplexes (G4s) are non‐canonical DNA structures implicated in a number of biological processes. Small‐molecule ligands can alter stability and folding of G4s, which can potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we investigate the interaction of telomeric DNA fragment from Tetrahymena thermophila (TET25, 5′‐G(TTGGGG)4‐3′) with a G4 ligand PyDH2 belonging to the bisquinolinium family. When alone, TET25 adopts a mixture of three conformations, with the most abundant being a four‐tetrad hybrid G4. In the presence of PyDH2, surprisingly, TET25 folds into an antiparallel chair G4, with PyDH2 intercalated between G‐tetrads 2 and 3, according to our crystal structure. The structure represents the second example, and the first crystallo­graphic evidence, of ligand intercalation into a G4. In solution, the interaction of PyDH2 and TET25 leads to a number of complexes differing by G4 topology and binding stoichiometry, strong stabilization of G4 (∆Tm = 12.4 °C in the presence of one equiv. of PyDH2) and large hysteresis of ∼ 10 °C, suggesting that ligand binding and G4 folding processes are complex."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long‐standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it's increased sensitivity toward hydrogen atoms relative to X‐ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker's reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate. Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge‐ and face‐bridging hydrides."

However, the dynamic nature of non‐covalent interactions hinders precise control over their chain architecture, resulting in poorly controlled self‐assembly, unpredictable morphologies, and limited utility. Herein, we introduce a novel molecular design for amphiphilic supramolecular BBCPs that overcomes key challenges in the field. The resulting materials exhibit superior thermodynamic stability in weakly polar solvents. This enables the first demonstration of well‐controlled self‐assembly of supramolecular surfactants within a complex emulsion system, leading to the formation of photonic supraballs with homogenous porous structures. Critically, precise chain architectural engineering enables pore diameter tuning over an unprecedented nanometer‐to‐micrometer range (67 nm–1.92 µm), significantly surpassing the maximum domain sizes achievable with self‐assembled covalent BBCPs. This extends the photonic bandgap into the mid‐wave infrared range, paving the way for next‐generation materials with potential applications in thermal management."

Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirms its hoop‐shaped structure and the existence of planar chirality arising from stereochemically distinct substituent orientations. The resolved pS and pR enantiomers display mirror‐imaged circular dichroism (CD) signals and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum| = 2.6 × 10⁻2).

    "abstract": "AbstractIncreasing the molecular weight of the acceptor is an effective strategy to suppress excessive crystallization and molecular diffusion, thereby addressing morphological challenges in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, designing high‐molecular‐weight acceptors with well‐defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene‐tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g mol−1 and a well‐defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8‐IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high‐power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8‐BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state‐of‐the‐art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature (Tg), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high‐performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs."

    "abstract": "The redox non‐innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high‐valent metal ions and facilitating proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low‐valent metal centers, as high‐valent metal‐dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high‐valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)‐oxo complexes featuring hydrogen‐bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W‐oxo forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene‐sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen‐bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV→III reduction at –1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII‐OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV=O state would populate the dithiolene π* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal = –3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene‐S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV‐H catalytic species."

    "abstract": "The introduction of supramolecular motifs allows the design of stimuli‐responsive polymers whose physical properties can be changed by external triggers that affect the supramolecular binding. However, using this approach to create light‐responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, supramolecular polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross‐links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2‐(4‐methoxy­styryl)‐4,6‐bis(trichloromethyl)‐1,3,5‐triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self‐reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the supramolecular cross‐links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto‐rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding‐on‐demand adhesives was explored in proof‐of‐concept experiments."

Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen‐doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultra‐low overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20 mV at 10 mA cm⁻² in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N‐doping of Ru clusters self‐optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self‐powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn‐H₂O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demoinstrating its practicability."

    "abstract": "Lithium‐sulfur batteries emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in under achievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focusses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides towards capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides along with future directions are discussed."

A set of samples, CPFD‐B/N‐5, CPFD‐B/N‐10, and CPFD‐B/N‐15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol‐formaldehyde‐dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD‐N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder‐free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behavior. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD‐B/N‐10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22 Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00 W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid‐state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb."

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT•Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N‐dimethylformamide, and water, the UV‐visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50–100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 – 14 × 109 M−2). While the formation of charge‐transfer states through ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal‐bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine."

    "abstract": "Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl‐type reaction involving both 1,4‐aryl‐ and 1,2‐aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation‐ and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation‐ or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design."

    "abstract": "Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen‐based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C‐C=C‐C‐N framework along with C=C‐C=C‐C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E–Z photoisomerization but also the 6π‐photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes. The symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical diarylethenes and satisfied the Woodward‐Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in diarylethenes, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the 6π‐photocyclization."

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N‐alkyl‐N, N′‐diarylhydrazines by boronic acid‐catalyzed one‐pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N–N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation‐sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late‐stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Brønsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Brønsted acid and H‐bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate‐limiting step."

Herein, we disclose an unconventional intramolecular proton‐coupled electron transfer activation of α‐keto acids by photoredox catalysis to generate ketyl radicals toward accessing functionalizable lactones. These lactones serve as synthons for modular one‐pot syntheses of trifluoromethyl ketones in a net dicarbofunctionalization of electron‐rich olefins."

However, synthesis of GNRs incorporating non‐hexagonal rings remains challenging, due to the thermodynamic instability compared to their hexagonal counterparts. Advancements in on‐surface synthesis and in‐situ characterization techniques have emerged as powerful methods for the atomically precise fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in on‐surface synthesis of non‐hexagonal ring‐embedded GNRs via sophisticated design of precursors and optimized reaction pathways.

    "abstract": "AbstractCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine‐based COFs, yielding TFPT‐sp2c‐COF, with a C═C linkage and TFPT‐IM‐COF, with a C═N linkage. TFPT‐sp2c‐COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT‐IM‐COF. More importantly, the C═C linkage in TFPT‐sp2c‐COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C═N linkage in TFPT‐IM‐COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and π‐delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT‐sp2c‐COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT‐IM‐COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions."

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties which are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present novel approach for size‐tunable diameter separation of single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal‐coordinating supramolecular polymers (M‐PNB) consisting of phenanthroline‐based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M‐PNB is confirmed by TEM analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 – 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 – 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M‐PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)‐SWNTs. This method offers not only size‐tunable diameter selectivity, but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency, and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques."

It involves a one-pot sequential multicomponent reaction, which was carried out in two different approaches (with and without purification of 5-aminoisoxazole). The method forms five chemical bonds and offers advantages such as easy product purification, availability of raw materials, high reaction efficiency, and environmental friendliness. This synthetic strategy has the potential to advance developments in heterocyclic chemistry."

These diazonium salts reacted with α,β-unsaturated functionalized compounds under Meerwein reaction conditions to yield pyrazole-containing building blocks, which subsequently allowed cyclization reactions with bisnucleophiles for the synthesis of pyrazol-3-yl-containing heterocyclic systems. In this way, pyrazole-containing heterocyclic compounds with 2-aminothiazole, 2-aminoselenazole, thiazolidin-4-one, selenazolidin-4-one, 3-hydroxythiophene, and 3-aminothiophene rings were efficiently prepared."

Key to this accomplishment is the highly diastereoselective synthesis of cis-fused bicyclic (3aS,6aS)- and (3aR,6aR)-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]pyrrol-2-one using Meyers’ tricyclic lactam methodology. The nucleophilic addition of trimethyl phosphite or dimethyl phenylphosphonite to chiral N-acyliminium ions affords the diastereoisomers, which are easily separated by column chromatography. The diastereoselectivity in the nucleophilic addition of the phosphorus reagents is completely consistent with our previous reports and all synthesized compounds were fully characterized."

There are two main methods for producing monofluorinated compounds: forming C–F bonds using fluorinating agents, or creating C–C bonds with fluorinated substrates. The latter method boasts a wider range of applicable substrates. We will discuss reactions involving various substrates, including NFSI, KHF2, Selectfluor, FABI, Et3N·3HF, COF2, ICH2F, DAST and others. We will review the advancements made over the past decade (2014-2024) and offer explanations of the underlying mechanisms."

In this Review, we examine twenty case studies from the last two decades of R&D in the pharmaceutical industry where non-stereoselective routes identified during medicinal chemistry campaigns were revised and new solutions for the stereoselective API candidate syntheses were identified during process development."

    "abstract": "1,3-diols, which are a frequent motif in biologically active molecules, can be prepared from readily available allylic alcohols via formal anti-Markovnikov hydration. The commonly employed hydroboration-oxidation sequence for the synthesis of terminal alcohols is challenging for allylic alcohols, and O-protection of the alcohol can be necessary. To increase atom economy, we explored the use of silane protecting groups that can be engaged in intramolecular hydrosilylation. Oxidative cleavage of the cyclized product yields the desired 1,3-diol and obviates the need for super-stoichiometric borane reagents. Based on a detailed study of O-silylation conditions, a protocol is presented that furnishes quantitative yields of a wide range of O-silylated alcohols which contain Si–H bonds for further functionalization. We show that a MOF-based Rh(II) porphyrin can furnish efficient intramolecular hydrosilylation while the corresponding homogeneous analogue proved unreactive. Radical trapping studies suggest that silyl radicals constitute key intermediates in Rh(II) catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation. Preferential 5-endo-trig versus 6-exo-trig cyclization and 5-exo-trig versus 6-endo-trig cyclization of the silyl radical intermediates led to chemoselective 1,3-diol formation for substrates containing multiple olefins."

This review discusses the synthesis of ferrocene compounds potentially relevant to electrochemical applications, focusing on recent strategies for nondirected C–H functionalization of the ferrocene core and diverse reactions for side-chain modifications. Advances in C–H activation of ferrocenes have been facilitated by catalytic methods utilizing Pd, Ir, Au, In, and Fe catalysts, as well as through photoredox and electrochemical techniques. Furthermore, side chains are modified via a range of mild transformations compatible with the ferrocene core, including substitution and annulation.

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective C–H activation via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has gained significant interest recently. One industrial application for HAT can be found in the tertiary benzylic C–H bond of cumene for producing phenol, a versatile chemical feedstock for various industries. However, the overall phenol yield remains low using the existing Hock process due to the poor selectivity towards the key reaction intermediate, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for phenol production through photooxidation of cumene to CHP using iron bromide under blue light irradiation, where bromine radicals (generated in situ via ligand-to-metal charge transfer) are used as hydrogen atom abstractors. Mechanistic studies revealed the cumene-to-CHP conversion occurred via a tertiary C–H bond abstraction by a radical mechanism, and the acetic acid and water additives increased CHP selectivity through stabilizing peroxides. The cumene-phenol process achieved up to 88% yield of CHP in 1 hour and could be used with a wide range of substrates. We thus developed a selective, mild, and efficient phenol production method using iron bromide under photooxidative conditions."

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and reducing carbon emissions to mitigate global warming poses a major challenge. The efficient utilization of carbon dioxide as a carbon resource requires the development of effective and straightforward synthetic strategies for C–C bond transformations. Recent studies have focused on transition-metal-catalyzed coupling reactions of carbon dioxide with soft nucleophiles such as alkynes, conjugated dienes, and various unsaturated hydrocarbons, demonstrating the formation of unsaturated carboxylic acids. This article describes carbon dioxide fixation reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons promoted by Ni and Cu catalysts that we have recently developed. Notably, these reactions feature highly regio- and stereoselective C–C bond formation facilitated by key intermediates involving organometalloids."

However, the gaseous nature of these reagents, along with their intrinsic inertness due to their high bond-dissociation energies (99-105 kcal·mol-1), have rendered traditional strategies ineffective or lacking in selectivity. The use of flow chemistry technology, nonetheless, has made a tremendous impact in this field, improving the efficiency of multiphasic processes through improved mass transfer and larger interfacial areas. In this work, we report a new flow chemistry platform for the photocatalytic hydroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkenes with both isobutane and n-butane. The methodology provides an efficient alternative for the rapid obtention of trifluoromethyl alkanes, which are well-known for being important bioisosteres of several functional groups."

Most of these compounds are based on complex D–A–D structures or multi-D–A systems, such as 4CzIPN. Whereas these systems have been widely studied and applied as photocatalysts, simpler D–A structures remain less explored. Nevertheless, the simplicity of D–A structures makes them the ideal structures to further understand the structure–property relationship of D–A molecules for optimizing their photocatalytic performance by simpler modification of the different D–A subunits. In particular, D–A structures featuring sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors have gained increasing attention for their use as photoredox catalysts. This study introduces a new family of D–A molecules by exploring various sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors, including a novel tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) unit and 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine (IMD). Our findings demonstrate that these simple D–A structures exhibit promising photocatalytic properties, comparable to those of more complex D–A–D systems."

    "abstract": "The development of streamlined methodologies for the expeditious assembly of structurally diverse organic architectures represents a paramount objective in contemporary synthetic chemistry, with far-reaching implications across pharmaceutical development, advanced materials innovation, and fundamental molecular science research. In recent years, controllable/divergent synthetic strategies for organic functional molecules using common starting materials have garnered significant attention due to their high efficiency. This review categorizes recent literatures focusing on key regulatory factors for product divergent formation, in which controlling chemical selectivity primarily relies on ligands, metal catalysts, solvents, time, temperature, acids/bases, and subtle modifications of substrates. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying reaction activity and selectivity differentiation, the review provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms of critical steps through specific case studies. It is hoped that the controllable/divergent synthesis concept will spark the interest of practitioners and aficionados to delve deeper into the discipline and pursue novel advancements in the realm of chemical synthesis."

The selectivity for heptanedioate (C72−) was attributed to cooperative hydrogen bonding, anion–π interactions, and a size-matching effect, as supported by DFT optimizations."

We investigate the data practice of researchers publishing in specialist organic chemistry journals, by analyzing the outputs of 240 randomly selected research papers from 12 top-ranked journals published in early 2023. We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance. We suggest first steps that researchers can take to move towards a positive culture of data sharing in organic chemistry. Routine actions that we encourage as standard practice include deposition of raw and metadata to open repositories, and inclusion of machine-readable structure identifiers for all reported compounds."

Here, we disclose the photoactivation of simple alkenylboronic esters established using alkene scrambling as a rapid reaction probe to identify a suitable catalyst and boron motif. Cyclic voltammetry, UV–vis analysis, and control reactions support sensitization, enabling an intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition to be realized accessing 3D bicyclic fragments containing a boron handle."

Remarkably, Cs3PO4 exhibits the highest extraction efficiency, driven by strong cooperative interactions involving ion-dipole coordination between Cs+ and carbonyl (C=O) groups, as well as direct ion-pairing interactions between 18-crown-6-complexed Cs+ and hexaurea-bound PO43−. Single-crystal structural analysis corroborates these interactions, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and providing valuable guidance for the rational design of advanced dual-host systems for selective ion separation."

In this work, we synthesized novel N-acylpyrazole-based photoswitches and conducted a comparative study with 33 phenylazopyrazoles, comparing their photoswitching properties and the impact of electronic effects. Using UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy, we discovered that simple acylation of the pyrazole moiety leads to increased quantum yields of isomerization, long Z-isomer life-times, good spectral separation, and high photostability."

    "abstract": "Pyrrolidine-2,3-diones are important intermediates in the synthesis of numerous nitrogen-containing heterocycles which possess a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities. In this article, we report the synthesis of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,3-diones via a reversible transimination reaction between Schiff’ base (C=N) linkage-containing pyrrolidine-2,3-dione derivatives and methylamine with yields of 80 to 92%. In addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-diphenylpyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5a) was also verified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized molecules were evaluated for compliance with established drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, Egan, and Muegge), as well as ADMET properties. All compounds satisfied these criteria, indicating favorable oral bioavailability. Molecular docking analysis showed that compounds 5a–e act as ligands for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), especially with Cys200 and Ser242 via hydrogen bonds. In addition, van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the ligand–iNOS complexes. In particular, 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-5-phenyl-1-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5e) exhibited the strongest binding affinity (−9.51 kcal/mol) and demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production, with an IC50 value of 43.69 ± 5.26 µM. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (-NO2 group) on the benzene ring at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine-2,3-dione subunit in compound 5e may be responsible for the observed high inhibition activity due to the enhancement and optimization of hydrogen bonding with Cys200. These results underscore the potential of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidenepyrrolidine-2,3-diones, especially compound 5e, as promising scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting iNOS-related pathologies."

Herein, the first two‐step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase‐catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16 h using eco‐friendly t‐amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4 h while keeping the same final yield.

In contrast, in the case of the 1,4‐diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron‐rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out."

This concept of redox‐convertible substituents has been successfully applied to expand the substrate scope for the pentafluorosulfanylation of α‐phenyl and α‐methyl styrenes by using SF6."

They are also recognized as versatile platforms for novel chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Benefitting from the development of transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and biocatalysis technologies in recent years, attention has exploited to new tactics for the asymmetric construction of chiral sulfinyl compounds and their derivatives. This review highlights the advances in the field of catalytic preparation of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) since 2020, with an emphasis on the substrate scope, mechanistic aspect, unmet challenges, and future opportunities."

Remarkably, this catalyst enables the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves BHP. The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage."

While (H)TPQs are typically non‐emissive and potentially open‐shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the π‐conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium‐containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena‐hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO‐LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia‐analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) and thiaradialene (1.58 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low‐lying LUMO energy levels."

The use of cage‐shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3‐pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre‐activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3‐pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3‐pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre‐activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4‐disubstituted 3‐pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide.

    "abstract": "AbstractGlycosyl furans represent versatile chiral platform molecules that can be readily accessed via the Garcia Gonzalez reaction. Herein, we report a dearomative, intramolecular bromoetherification of carbohydrate‐derived glycosyl furans to generate enantiopure 6‐bromo‐furo[3,2‐b]furans in up to 69% yield. The method employs N‐Br aromatic amides as competent electrophilic halogenating agents that outpace other known reagents. The method works for glycosyl furans derived from the Garcia Gonzalez reactions of various active methylene compounds and unprotected sugars. Further functionalization of the C−Br bond of the 6‐bromo‐furo[3,2‐b]furans is explored as well."

    "abstract": "AbstractUnspecific Peroxygenases have been the subject of a lot of research in the recent past as they offer opportunities for green hydroxylation reactions using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as donor. A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co‐substrate H2O2. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an l‐amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide in situ at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95%."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe skeleton editing strategy has emerged as a transformative approach in drug discovery and agrochemical innovation, enabling precise modifications through the insertion, elimination, or substitution of specific atoms within the core carbon‐ or heterocyclic frameworks of molecules. Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single‐carbon‐atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five‐membered carbon‐ and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six‐membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven‐membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo‐ and electro‐catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single‐carbon‐atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology."

Nevertheless, thermal activation remains mandatory in most cases, which may decrease the compatibility with sensitive functional groups. In this context, improvements of conventional strategies must be an important source of research in order to enhance the applicability of such methods for building complex scaffolds. In this work, we contribute to this aim by implying visible‐light as the sole energy source in a Pd‐catalyzed rearrangement reaction involving N‐tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. These mild reaction conditions efficiently allow oxidative addition, aryl migration and β‐hydride elimination at room temperature, allowing the construction of various 1,1’ disubstituted olefins."

This strategy uses synthetically upstream nitroarenes as viable aniline surrogates and B2(pin)2 as an enabling organic reductant, producing a wide range of 4‐quinolones bearing different functional groups in a step‐economical fashion.

    "abstract": "AbstractAqueous solutions of nanoparticles are the cornerstones for applications in diagnostics, catalysis and more, where control over the nanoparticle's dispersion is pivotal to tailoring the final product properties. Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono‐disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra‐dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room‐temperature structural transformation‐induced in situ core‐shell self‐assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre‐core‐shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit >80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential >80 mV) even after >10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single‐photon emission with g(2)(0) M is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering."

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon‐based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium‐ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide‐based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double‐layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of π‐conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub‐graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon‐like large π‐conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen‐free edge C(sp2)–H sites, and well‐defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g−1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g−1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials. These findings provide a fundamental design strategy for carbon‐based cathodes in LICs that highlighting the role of π‐conjugation and edge chemistry in electrochemical performance, paving the way for next‐generation high‐capacity, high‐voltage energy storage devices."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid‐state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)‐vacancies (O‐LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐based CPEs (PEO@O‐LZO). The O‐LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O‐vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O‐vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O‐LZO at 40 °C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O‐LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40 °C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid‐state lithium metal batteries."

    "abstract": "AbstractSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non‐invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off‐target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic‐based Calibrated 5‐ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non‐pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5‐ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia‐inducible promoter regulating O‐acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post‐treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor‐specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5‐ALA‐based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor‐targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes."

    "abstract": "AbstractManipulating the crystal structure and microstructure is fundamentally paramount for designing advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. Kagome‐lattice metals attracted considerable attention due to desirable electronic and magnetic properties but are rarely considered for application as structural materials. In this study, a concept of kagome composite is proposed to realize mechanically zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy over a wide temperature window, exemplified by the Lu‐Fe‐Co ternary alloys prepared by two‐step synthesis. Using magnetic Co doping, the kagome lattice magnetic order is stabilized in the parent hexagonal Lu2Fe17 structure, and its thermal expansion regulated simultaneously. By in situ precipitation of the α‐(Fe/Co) phase in the matrix, a soft/hard heterogeneous structure emerges and an ultra‐wide temperature window axial ZTE composite (αl = +0.98 × 10−6 K−1, 110–800 K) with good compressive strength (1.11 GPa) is achieved. This work opens up the prospect of kagome intermetallic composite in the integration of structure and function."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe ability of cytokine receptors to mediate the internalization of targets in lysosomes positions them as specific and effective effectors for protein degradation strategies. However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell‐proliferation‐related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7‐targeting chimera (AP‐CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein‐targeting aptamer with a mutant‐CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP‐CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP‐CRTAC constructed with a 2′ F‐pyrimidine‐modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP‐CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR‐targeted therapies, to the third‐generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This research introduces an engineered CXCR7 inducer with high specificity and programmability for the targeted degradation of cell surface proteins, while minimizing unwanted side effects."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe silicon microparticles (SiMPs) offer a promising solution for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion battery systems. However, the inevitable volume expansion (>300%) of SiMPs during alloying often leads to particle breakage, interface rupture, and electrode separation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid–liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high‐energy‐density flexible lithium‐ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid‐phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid‐phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of >99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high‐voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm−2, high volumetric energy density of 500 Wh L−1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0 mm. This work provides a new electrode design approach to achieve high‐energy‐density flexible lithium‐ion batteries."

    "abstract": "AbstractAdvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon‐based single‐atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra‐effective and anti‐interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in‐depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro‐level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular‐oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state‐of‐the‐art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the “oxidant‐catalyst‐pollutants” internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC‐AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting‐edge laboratory devices and pilot‐scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs‐AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided. This review aims to promote the large‐scale potential of SACs‐based AOPs in practical water treatment by emphasizing the pivotal role of micro‐insights."

    "abstract": "AbstractSolar‐driven one‐step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber‐Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra‐low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co‐synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO‐Fe), enabling the formation spatially‐separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d‐electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO‐Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo‐photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi‐directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction."

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but existing photocatalysts often suffer from modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co‐activation, such as Mg‐activated water or non‐sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon‐nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox‐flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry."

    "abstract": "AbstractAqueous deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) offer great potential for low‐cost zinc‐ion batteries but often have limited performance. Discovering new electrolytes is therefore crucial, yet time‐consuming and resource‐intensive. In response, this work presents a Large Language Model (LLM)‐based multi‐agent network that proposes DEE compositions for zinc‐ion batteries. By analyzing academic papers from the DEE field, the network identifies innovative, inexpensive, and sustainable Lewis bases to pair with Zn(BF4)2·xH2O. A Zn(BF4)2·xH2O‐ethylene carbonate (EC) system demonstrates high conductivity (10.6 mS cm−1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (2.37 V). The optimized electrolyte enables stable zinc stripping/plating, achieves outstanding rate performance (81 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), and supports 4000 cycles in Zn||polyaniline cells at 3 A g−1. Spectroscopic analyses and simulations reveal that EC coordinates to Zn2+, mitigating water‐induced corrosion, while a fluorine‐rich hybrid organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enhances stability. This work showcases a pioneering LLM‐driven approach to electrolyte development, establishing a new paradigm in materials research."

    "abstract": "AbstractCyanogroup (‐CN) is a strongly electron‐withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high‐performance small‐molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN‐F, phCN‐Cl, 2phCN‐F, and 2phCN‐Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN‐F‐based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN‐F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85°C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record‐breaking SMAs."

    "abstract": "AbstractInorganic hydrogels have great potential in many applications as sustainable materials, but lack flexibility due to rigid network structures. Here, a novel strategy is proposed—an inorganic polymer hydrogel, prepared by crosslinking long‐chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+), which effectively address the rigidity and fragility issues commonly associated with traditional inorganic gels. With the most stable hydration shell among those ions, Ni2+ tends to interact indirectly with LPP through hydrogen bonds rather than coordination bonds. The unique Ni2+‐phosphate interaction endows the Ni‐LPP hydrogels with ultrahigh elongation at break (≈15 000×). Further experiments reveal that the Ni2+‐phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor. The highly extensible, good conductive (1.06 ± 0.08 S m−1), self‐healing (within 30 s and without stimulation), arbitrarily shapeable, and nonflammable Ni‐LPP inorganic hydrogel indicates a bright future in flexible electronics, environmental remediation, and beyond."

    "abstract": "AbstractObesity‐induced insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, and chronic low‐grade inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance through the activation of tissue‐infiltrating immune cells. Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity‐related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light‐responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual‐targeting and multiple‐signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1‐like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low‐grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs‐mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long‐term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light‐sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems."

    "abstract": "AbstractLi‐rich Mn‐based layered (LMR) cathodes with anionic redox chemistry show great potential for next‐generation sustainable Li‐ion battery (LIB) applications due to the low cost and high energy density. However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order–disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25 V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order–disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li‐rich cathode materials through a dedicated order–disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage."

Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self‐healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200 ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real‐time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R‐TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote‐controlling platforms, paving the way for large‐scale, multi‐scenario applications."

However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four‐electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy‐saving H₂ production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high‐value‐added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure–performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research."

The need for enhanced contrast through improved tumor‐to‐background ratio (TBR) and the toxicity from repeated injections due to fading fluorescent signals further complicate the issue. Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface‐stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image‐guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin‐conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR ∼ 2), while enabling prolonged 3‐day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation. This innovative method offers substantial improvements over existing fluorescent contrast agents and holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer surgery."

Herein, this study distinct subgroups and two differentiation pathways associated with N1 and N2 polarization during AP by single‐cell sequencing. Inspired by this, a hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO2)‐based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) conjugated with neutrophil‐binding Ly‐6G antibody and loaded with porphyrin is developed for targeted and in situ modulation of neutrophil polarization. Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O2, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive single‐cell atlas of neutrophils in AP and proposes an innovative hitchhiking therapeutic strategy for AP by restricting ROS in neutrophils."

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping organic aggregation‐induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) excitable with the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) light, which offers enhanced tissue penetration and a high maximum permissible exposure to light, is highly advantageous for bioimaging applications but remains a significant challenge. In this work, the molecular lock strategy is employed to fuse two alkyl‐substituted thiophenes, leading to the design of alkyl‐substituted dithieno[3,2‐b:2′,3′‐d]pyrrole (aDTP). This novel π‐bridge features a planar structure with strong electron‐donating capability while suppressing intermolecular π–π interactions, enabling the construction of an NIR‐II absorption‐active AIEgen, named aDTP‐TPA. The enhanced π‐conjugation and donor‐acceptor interactions of aDTP‐TPA result in NIR‐II absorption and an increased molar extinction coefficient (ɛ), exhibiting superior photophysical properties compared to its thiophene‐based counterparts, C6T‐TPA and DC6T‐TPA. When formulated into water‐soluble nanoparticles (NPs), aDTP‐TPA NPs demonstrate remarkable tissue penetration depth and improved imaging resolution. In vivo studies, systemic blood vessel angiography, mesenteric circulation imaging, brain vasculature visualization, and NIR‐II‐guided tumor surgery underscore the exceptional imaging capabilities of these NPs for biomedical applications. This work highlights that the molecularly locked π‐bridge strategy holds great promise for developing AIEgens with NIR‐II excitation, paving the way for advanced NIR‐II bioimaging applications."

However, the necessity of an auxiliary field for achieving deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization is the critical bottleneck for practical application. Here, it is demonstrated that an unconventional spin current with perpendicular spin polarization can be generated by the alignment of uncompensated interfacial spins at the ultrathin IrMn/Ta(Ti) or PtMn/Ta(Ti) interfaces prepared with the presence of an in situ field, which allows field‐free switching. Furthermore, due to the pinned interfacial spins exerted by the bulk antiferromagnetic layers, the switching polarity remains unchanged after a disturbance field of 3000 Oe or higher, showing strong writing robustness against stray field disturbance. The work offers a strategy to address the critical bottleneck and promotes the advancement of SOT‐MRAM toward commercialization."

Despite significant progress, achieving field‐free switching of perpendicular magnetization with short current pulses, minimal incubation delay, and low energy consumption remains a critical obstacle for the practical realization of high‐speed SOT devices. Here, field‐free SOT switching is demonstrated at sub‐nanosecond timescales in a PtTe2/WTe2/CoFeB heterostructure that fulfills all above requirements. The unique combination of WTe2, with its low crystal symmetry, facilitates field‐free SOT switching at reduced current densities, while PtTe2, characterized by its high spin Hall conductivity, enhances energy efficiency. Moreover, the significant in‐plane spin Hall conductivity from PtTe2 contributes to shortening the incubation delay. The results establish a promising path toward energy‐efficient, high‐speed SOT memory devices, offering a practical field‐free solution to meet the performance demands of next‐generation memory technologies."

Here, a unique low‐temperature annealing strategy is adopted to eliminate the SFs in flexible γ‐InSe and optimize the crystal quality. The annihilation dynamics of the SFs are revealed by using the in situ heating observation on the state‐of‐the‐art spherical aberration‐corrected transmission electron microscopy. The annealed γ‐InSe not only exhibits intrinsic out‐of‐plane sliding ferroelectricity in a wide thickness range from a single unit cell (trilayer) to tens of nanometers, but also demonstrates efficient superlinear photoluminescence with higher beam quality and lower thresholds.

    "abstract": "AbstractPolar interfaces with broken inversion symmetry have garnered significant attention due to their profound influence on charge/spin distribution and propagation, leading to unconventional phenomena such as high‐mobility electron gas, polar skyrmions, and interfacial pyroelectric/pyro‐phototronic effects. Designing and controlling polar interfaces is crucial for developing advanced functional electronic devices. Here, a strategy of polar interface engineering is proposed by modulating the built‐in electric field in Schottky junctions to generate and tune the pyro‐phototronic effect in a centrosymmetric semiconductor (β‐Ga2O3). By varying the work functions of metal electrodes and doping concentrations, the built‐in electric field is effectively controlled, enabling modulation of the effective polarization and pyroelectric coefficient. Leveraging the pyro‐phototronic effect, the Ga2O3 Schottky junction‐based self‐powered photodetector achieves an ultrafast response of 0.2 µs to solar‐blind UV light, representing a 50‐fold improvement over the control device operating with the photoconductive effect. Furthermore, five optoelectronic logic gates are realized, enabled by the bidirectional pyro‐phototronic current during light switching. These findings provide a pathway for exploring novel pyro‐phototronic phenomena in polar‐interface‐engineered semiconductors and advancing ultrafast optoelectronic detection technologies."

Both materials exhibit multienzyme‐like (oxidase‐, peroxidase‐, superoxide dismutase‐, catalase‐like) activities, with Cu‐SLCDs showing higher activity levels.

In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Cu‐SLCDs effectively eliminate over 98.6% of bacteria at a concentration of 25 µg mL−1, while reducing reactive oxygen species levels in normal cells to promoting efficient wound healing.

Here, it is demonstrated that polymer conformation, governed by backbone rigidity and persistence length, is the critical determinant of molecular weight dependent performance in bulk‐heterojunction OSCs. By analyzing the benchmark polymers PM6 and D18, opposing trends is uncovered: PM6 achieves peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.11% at low number‐average molecular weight (Mn∼51 kDa), 18.47% at medium‐Mn (68 kDa), and declining to 16.83% at high Mn (122 kDa), whereas D18 improves from 16.87% (41 kDa) to 17.75% (67 kDa) and 19.15% (83 kDa). Neutron scattering and computational modeling reveal that D18's bulky 2‐butyloctyl side chains impose high rotational barriers, stiffening the backbone and extending its persistence length. This rigidity enables high‐Mn D18 to form ordered crystalline domains that enhance charge transport. In contrast, PM6's flexible backbone shortens its persistence length, driving amorphous tie‐chain formation at high Mn that disrupts crystallinity and exacerbates recombination. These results establish polymer conformation and persistence length as universal descriptors linking Mn to microstructure, resolving long‐standing contradictions in polymer design."

    "abstract": "AbstractRespiratory infections are the major cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide, which impose a heavy burden on public healthcare. Many respiratory viruses induce indistinguishable clinical symptoms, making accurate detection and effective surveillance challenging. Here, a polarization‐sensitive multiplex biochip is presented utilizing self‐assembled anisotropic nanochains for simultaneous colorimetric detection of multiple pathogens in human nasal, throat, and serum samples. The biochip features a patterned wettability surface, wherein the hydrophobic pattern facilitates precise sample segmentation, blocking the detection interferences. The hydrophilic areas can be utilized not only to print functionalized nanochains for selective identifications of different respiratory viruses, but also to support target preconcentration through the coffee‐ring phenomenon, enhancing the efficiency of virus detection. Furthermore, strong light confinement is shown near the nanochain surface by tailoring incident polarization, which enlarges colorimetric response sensitivity to virus loading. Thus, the simultaneous quantification of various respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and adenovirus, is achieved with a detection limit of 10 PFU mL−1. In clinical tests, influenza patients are successfully distinguished from other volunteers with an accuracy of 96.2%. This method eliminates the need for extrinsic labels or preamplification, which is expected to expand at‐home diagnostic tools for respiratory pathogens."

A lentivirus carrying the triple‐fusion probe is prepared for stable transfection of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

Then, hiPSC‐derived neural progenitors and hCOs are transplanted into the mouse brains. Multimodal imaging is performed to trace the survival, distribution, integration, and functional activity of transplanted cells, providing multi‐scale data of exogenous cell behavior and fate in host brains.

Yet their practical use is hindered by structural damage under high pressure. Conventional strategies like thickening membranes, reducing interlayer spacing, or cross‐linking nanosheets improve pressure resistance but significantly reduce water permeability to impractical levels (e.g., 0.15 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 at 60 bar). Here, this dilemma is addressed by designing ultrathin GO/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid membranes. The CNT network reinforces the stacked GO nanosheets by reducing their free‐standing diameter while increasing membrane thickness and Young's modulus. The pressure resistance is achieved up to 60 bar, triple that of the pristine GO membranes. A maximum water flux of 966 ± 96 L m−2 h−1 is achieved by a 68 nm thick GO/CNT membrane with optimal GO nanosheet size and CNT loading amount, facilitating 1–3 orders of magnitude higher water flux per unit membrane thickness than all available membranes. This breakthrough resolves the critical trade‐offs among pressure resistance, flux, and membrane thickness, marking a transformative leap in GO‐based nanofiltration efficiency. The innovation holds immediate potential for applications in sustainable water remediation, pharmaceuticals, energy storage, and electronics."

Traditional therapies struggle to balance tumor elimination with bone preservation and functional restoration. This study presents a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing high‐purity biodegradable magnesium (Mg) implants, which induce dual‐mode bone tumor death orchestrated by the cGAS‐STING pathway. Released Mg ions trigger autophagic cell death through TRPM7‐mediated uptake, with cGAS‐STING promoting LC3 lipidation by supplying STING‐laden ERGIC membranes. Simultaneously, alkaline degradation byproducts disrupt tumor metabolism by suppressing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, with cGAS‐STING further targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2) to amplify metabolic collapse. This coordinated mechanism reshapes the tumor microenvironment, promoting M1 macrophage polarization, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and enhanced intratumoral IFN‐γ secretion, fostering a robust, sustained immune response. The therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of Mg implants are validated in murine osteosarcoma, patient‐derived xenografts, and VX2 rabbit bone tumor models, demonstrating significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival without systemic toxicity. This work highlights the multifunctional capabilities of biodegradable Mg implants, integrating autophagic death, metabolic suppression, and immune modulation through cGAS‐STING coordination, presenting a promising and clinically translatable strategy for advanced bone tumor therapy."

Here, the Fe3O4‐FeCo‐Fe5C2 ternary catalyst was successfully constructed. Notably, the different contents of Co doping optimized the heterogeneous catalytic interface of the FeCo alloy clusters, which promoted the targeted conversion of CO2 to light olefins in high yield (22.4%) and effectively suppressed the generation of CO (4.4%). The study shows that the formation of FeCo alloy clusters significantly promotes the forward progression of the Reverse Water‐Gas Reaction (RWGS), which can greatly enhance the conversion of CO2 and inhibit the formation of CO according to Le Chatelier's principle. Moreover, the FeCo alloy clusters significantly promoted the rapid formation of CHx and induced the chain growth of CHx on Fe5C2 phase. Hence, the clever construction of FeCo alloy clusters significantly strengthens the kinetic coupling between the RWGS and FTS reactions. Additionally, the in‐situ structural evolution of the catalysts, along with the real‐time formation process of the products, was monitored through in‐situ characterization. This work is promising to provide an effective strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to achieve high yields of light olefins over FeCo alloy clusters."

While it is common to leverage the electronic effect of organic ligands to functionalize TMDs, the corresponding steric hinderance has remained elusive and underexplored. Herein N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) functionalization of WS2 is demonstrated via a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) route, which exploits both the electronic and steric effect for TMD functionalization. The Lewis base, 1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)imidazol‐2‐ylidene (IMes), is anchored to the sulfur vacancy sites (Lewis acid) of the WS2 nanostructures with the hybrid‐interface‐mediated steric hinderance, mimicking the FLP chemistry and enabling dihydrogen cleavage at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) results reveal the local chemical environment of the activated hydrogen species, which can be transferred for room‐temperature hydrogenation reactions. The insights are useful for designing weak, non‐covalent bonds to modify the 2D surface of TMDs for a broad scope of applications."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe high‐power‐density and high‐temperature operation of third‐generation power semiconductor devices (e.g., SiC/GaN) is limited by epoxy resin (EP)‐based packaging materials due to three key challenges: (1) Low thermal conductivity brings heat accumulation; (2) High interfacial stress from the ≈ 20 times higher thermal expansion coefficient of EP versus SiC/GaN causes thermal cycling‐induced interfacecracks, significant performance or lifespan degradation and even device failure; (3) The flammable nature of EP enhances the risk factor caused by thermal runaway. Herein, a thermal‐expansion offset and flame retardant Zn1.5Cu0.5P2O7 (ZCPO) is design with a negative thermal expansion coefficient of ‐20 × 10−6/ °C, within temperature ranges of 20 ∼ 190 °C, which enables to achieve a ceramic‐like thermal expansion coefficient (4 × 10−6/ °C) and UL‐94 V‐0 rating flame retardancy in ZCPO/EP‐61 composite for the first time. The perfectly matched thermal expansion coefficient minimizes the interfacial stress between EP and chips or thermoelectric cooler, thus a simple thermoelectric cooling architecture is designed for power semiconductor device without thermal interface material 2 (TIM2), which enables to achieve a cooling temperature of 26.85 °C, 8 °C lower than that with TIM2 (18.89 °C)."

    "abstract": "AbstractAltermagnetism and ferroelectricity are reported in certain materials. However, the possibility of their coexistence or interplay in a single‐material phase remains an open question. Here, the multiferroicity in hexagonal wurtzite MnSe (w‐MnSe) is explored via first‐principles calculations. The w‐MnSe exhibits an altermagnet semiconducting nature characterized by a direct bandgap of 1.98 eV and spin splitting of up to 245 meV in the valence band structure. The w‐MnSe has an in‐plane magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of −31 µeV per cell along the a‐direction and a Néel temperature (TN) of ≈405 K. Besides, the w‐MnSe exhibits a giant out‐of‐plane spontaneous electric polarization of 53 µC cm−2 and a moderate energy barrier of 0.37 eV f.u−1. The ferroelectric critical temperature (TC) of 965 K is obtained, and this may indicate excellent thermal stability. The correlation is postulated between altermagnetim and ferroelectricity to control spin orientation mediated by the rotation of polyhedra formed by nonmagnetic elements within the lattice structure. The finding implies that the w‐MnSe can be a potential material for future‐generation multiferroic devices that operate above room temperature."

    "abstract": "AbstractImpaired fracture healing in diabetic patients poses a persistent clinical challenge, with underlying mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated. These findings reveal that high glucose microenvironments generate excessive reactive oxygen species in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic impairment. These pathophysiological disruptions suppress osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs while driving pro‐inflammatory polarization in BMDMs, processes closely tied to high‐glucose‐induced inhibition of Adenosine 5′‐monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Restoration of AMPK phosphorylation emerges as a pivotal strategy to mitigate oxidative stress and restore cellular function. To address this, a dual‐targeted therapeutic system (DLNPs@HA hydrogel) is developed that combines anti‐CD105‐antibody‐modified nanoliposomes and phosphatidylserine‐modified nanoliposomes, both encapsulating the specific AMPK activator α‐lipoic acid. This hydrogel facilitates sustained nanoparticle release, enabling precise and effective delivery to BMSCs and BMDMs. In vitro, DLNPs@HA hydrogel successfully enhances osteogenic activity and suppresses inflammatory responses. In vivo, it accelerates fracture healing in diabetic mice. By precisely targeting BMSCs and BMDMs and reversing bicellular oxidative stress, this integrative medical‐engineering strategy provides a promising and translatable solution for diabetic fracture repair, seamlessly bridging mechanistic insights with therapeutic innovation."

    "abstract": "AbstractSelf‐assembled organic chromophores form nanostructures in solutions, with their molecular packing determining the optoelectronic properties and photocatalytic activity. Here an organic dye molecule is reported, 1,3,6,8‐tetrakis(4‐ethynylbenzoic acid)pyrene (TEBAPy), that exhibits two aggregate states in aqueous conditions: nanofibers or nanoparticles, depending on the charge‐screening conditions. The nanofibers promote sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen production (H2, 84 mmol g−1 h−1) while the nanoparticles produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 85 mmol g−1 h−1). Using a combination of structural and photophysical characterizations, it is shown that the photocatalytic activity is determined by the nature of the formed self‐assembled aggregate, demonstrating the potential of supramolecular nanostructures to tune their activity and switch their reactivity. It is shown clear correlation between the presence of fibrous nanostructures and photocatalytic H2 evolution, with spectroscopy showing mixing of excitonic states that enables efficient charge separation over multiple chromophore units. In the nanoparticular aggregates, on the contrary, the excitation is localized and leads to excimer formation that is involved in H2O2 production. The results demonstrate that the molecular packing of a single chromophore in self‐assembled organic nanostructures can not only optimize solar fuel production but also enable multiple and switchable photocatalytic functions."

    "abstract": "Global reliance on synthetic surfactants has led to significant environmental challenges, with current management and policy efforts proving to be largely ineffective. Sustainable and environment‐friendly surfactants offer a promising solution for mitigating these impacts. This study introduces an emulsifier composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and partially cation‐substituted hyaluronate (CHA), both of which are derived from abundant and cost‐effective natural polysaccharides. The synergistic interplay of electrostatic interactions and controlled molecular entanglement between these macromolecules significantly enhances the stability and ripening resistance of the water‐in‐oil emulsion. This optimized formulation demonstrates remarkable longevity, maintaining emulsion integrity for over 365 days while exhibiting exceptional salt tolerance and pH stability across various environmental conditions. Additionally, this entangled polysaccharide‐based Pickering emulsion demonstrated strong adhesion to leaf surfaces, resisting the effects of strong winds and the water‐repellent properties of the lotus leaves. These characteristics associated with microbial compatibility suggest that emulsifiers based on CNCs and CHA provide safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants, especially pertinent to the agrochemical sector."

However, the high reaction barrier for CH bond breaking and uphill overall reaction lead to the slow kinetics of DMF coupling. Here, we reveal that [HSO4−] and water can collaboratively promote the rate‐limiting step of the CH bond breaking on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 catalyst. An in‐depth study suggests that water mediates hole transfer to the CH bond while [HSO4−] facilitates electron extraction, thus promoting electron and proton transfer on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 surface. Consequently, photocatalytic DMF coupling over Ru‐ZnIn2S4 produces diesel fuel precursors (DFPs) and H2 with benchmarking formation rates of 1.5 g gcatal.−1 h−1 and 9.7 mmol gcatal.−1 h−1, respectively. Moreover, the selectivity of branched‐chain DFPs reaches 55%. This work puts forward new insight and strategy for photocatalytic CC coupling for the synthesis of biofuels."

    "abstract": "Catalytic fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising technology for obtaining different fractions and the valorization of lignin. Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is one of these technologies in which catalysts play an essential role. In this work, the impact of impurities in catalysts on the output of RCF is investigated. It is found that the yield of phenolic monomers is almost not influenced by the residual chloride (Cl) ions in the commercially available Ru/C catalyst. However, the presence of Cl ions in the catalyst facilitated hemicellulose removal and delignification. Moreover, the enzymatic conversion rate of cellulose in the solid residue increases after RCF, attributed to the enhanced removal of lignin and hemicellulose in the presence of Cl ions. The impact of Cl ions can be eliminated by removing the Cl ions in the catalyst. This work provides an engineering perspective for upscaling RCF technology using large‐scale synthesized catalysts."

    "abstract": "Developing a selective lignin depolymerization process remains a daunting challenge due to lignin's inherent structural heterogeneity and chemical complexity. This study used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction to produce oligomeric lignin with controlled structural characteristics (narrow size distribution, lower molecular weight) and further subjected it to oxidative depolymerization using peracetic acid as an oxidant. Oxidation of lignin resulting from lactic acid/pyrazole and choline chloride/lactic acid extraction produces phenolic acids (Ph‐COOH) and dicarboxylic acid (DCA) as significant products. Our results show that the judicial choice of DES during extraction plays a critical role in determining the lignin chemical structure, which follows different oxidation pathways and results in different product selectivities. The generalization of this concept has been established with two different parent lignins, e.g., Douglas fir (D.fir) and wheat straw (WS). The overall process showed that the novel DES extraction not only provides a sustainable pathway for high‐purity lignin generation but also could be used as a tool to produce high‐value products selectively upon its oxidation, thus improving the overall lignin biorefinery process."

The traditional deposited AIRFB has a limited depth of discharge and is prone to metal dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution side reactions during operation. In contrast, the all‐soluble AIRFB, where the active substances are all fully soluble, offers flexible operation that is more conducive to industrial development of AIRFB. However, the all soluble AIRFB electrolyte still requires improvement of its solubility, long‐term stability, reactivity, and electrode potential. This review introduces the concepts for modification of the AIRFB electrolyte and presents the main ideas and methods for electrolyte improvement, as well as the challenges faced and possible research directions for the future."

However, both monomer and polymer syntheses typically require anaerobic and moisture‐free conditions, often employing hazardous reagents and solvents that limit scalability. Herein, efficient, scalable syntheses for poly(ethyl lipoate) and ethyl lipoate that incorporate Green Chemistry principles are disclosed. The synthesis of ethyl lipoate from lipoic acid on a 100‐gram scale (>80% yield) is optimized lowering the E‐factor (2.27) by an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Diphenyl phosphate, a nonhazardous commercial organic acid, is used to synthesize ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethyl lipoate) on a 50‐gram scale from cationic ROP (CROP). The polymerizations proceed under ambient atmosphere in low‐hazard and renewable solvents, and a mild depolymerization strategy to regenerate the monomer is developed. Due to their extreme molar mass, the materials possess unique mechanical and physical properties. Life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted on synthetic and recycling processes shows that the polydisulfide has competitive environmental impacts comparable to several commodity polymers, despite the latter having an efficiency advantage due to economies of scale. These discoveries establish an economical and scalable closed‐loop polymer platform that can be broadly applied to various polydisulfides sourced from 1,2‐dithiolanes such as lipoic acid."

This study introduces liquid humins as precursors for synthesizing innovative carbon materials tailored for Pd/C catalysts. These materials mitigate the “dead” metal issue, where inaccessible Pd particles hinder catalytic efficiency. By exploring methods to convert liquid humins into carbon materials with optimized porous structures and nitrogen doping, we developed Pd/C catalysts with significantly enhanced performance. A novel carbon support derived from a composite of thermally cured humins and melamine exhibited low microporosity and high nitrogen content, thereby minimizing Pd encapsulation. Catalytic applications of these Pd/C materials in Suzuki‐Miyaura, Mizoroki‐Heck, and nitroarene hydrogenation reactions demonstrated superior activity, surpassing many existing biomass‐derived Pd/C catalysts. The work highlights humins as a renewable resource for high‐performance catalyst development, addressing critical sustainability and efficiency challenges in catalysis. This approach opens new avenues in green chemistry and valorization of industrial by‐products, paving the way for cost‐effective and scalable applications in organic synthesis."

    "abstract": "This paper presents three sulfone‐ or cyano‐decorated photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with adjustable arm lengths and linkages for photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is found that, upon replacing imine linkage with cyanated vinylene, under the irrdation of visible light, the H2O2 production rates (HPR) considerably increases from 2261 μmol h‐1 g‐1 to 7613 μmol h‐1 g‐1 in pure water and O2 atmosphere without the assistance of any sacrificial agent. Even though in air atmosphere, its HPR value still reaches 6339 μmol h‐1 g‐1 with good recyclability. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to the the enhanced polarity through the incoporation of strong polar sulfone or cyano groups in the COF frameworks, which brings about the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, high photocurrent intensity and low charge resistance as well as the increased surface hydrophilicity. The photocatalytic mechanism is studied by means of the theoretical calculations and comparative experiments conducted under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of the various scavengers for electron, hole, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical in the reaction system."

    "abstract": "Plastics are indispensable in daily life, with both production and waste generation increasing annually. As the world strives for net‐zero emissions, advancing plastic recycling technologies has become a global priority. Pyrolytic liquefaction is a promising approach for recovering chemical feedstocks, including fuel fractions, from waste plastics, potentially substituting petroleum resources. Since the 1970s, research on pyrolytic liquefaction has progressed globally, and several industrial‐scale plants are now in operation. However, to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it is crucial to bridge the knowledge gap between lab‐scale research and industrial‐scale implementation of pyrolysis‐liquefaction technologies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of plastic recycling, the progress and challenges in cutting‐edge lab‐scale research on pyrolytic liquefaction, alongside the latest trends in industrial‐scale liquefaction projects. It reveals that pyrolytic liquefaction of a wide range of plastics–including halogenated plastics and poly(ethylene terephthalate)–has been extensively studied at the laboratory level. In contrast, industrial‐scale operations often focus on more common, easily pyrolyzed plastics and generally avoid the use of catalysts. This highlights the urgent need to develop robust, reusable, and cost‐effective catalysts, as well as optimized process designs, to expand the range of plastic feedstocks suitable for industrial‐scale pyrolysis plants."

Research studies are most generally carried out with pure gas streams of CO2, while the available real sources of CO2 are gases coming out from industrial plants and containing a low share of CO2, and a great diversity of impurities including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Here, we show that a molecular catalyst, [Rh(bpy)(Cp*)Cl]Cl (bpy = bipyridine, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), catalyzes CO2RR to formic acid using a quasi flue gas (5‐10% CO2 and 100 ppm NO2 or 50 ppm SO2) with substantial selectivity. This is made possible thanks to the modification of the cathode surface with a positively charged imidazolium layer, which greatly favors CO2RR over competing reactions, proton, NO2 and SO2 reductions. These results highlight the potential of combining molecular catalysis and electrode surface modification for electroreduction of diluted CO2 without prior carbon capture or purification."

    "abstract": "Electride based materials are among the most active catalysts for ammonia synthesis, with a strong potential for application in the development of green ammonia synthesis. However, their synthesis often requires complicated reaction conditions limiting their scalability. In this study, we present a straightforward and scalable synthesis method for a BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C oxy‐electride composite via carboxylic acid complexation (pseudo‐Pechini) followed by carbothermal reduction. The resulting composite exhibits significant surface area, of ~41 m2 g‐1, which is considerably higher than the electrides prepared by solid‐state synthesis. Upon loading with ruthenium, the BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C composite demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis, achieving rates of 3090 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 0.6Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C, and 3737 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 1.1Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C at mild reaction conditions (400 °C and 1 bar). Comprehensive characterization through XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and STEM‐EDS confirmed the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, while iodometric titration method and EPR analysis confirmed the electride‐like nature of the resulting composite. The results reported in this work highlight a straightforward approach for the design of electride‐based composite material displaying superior catalytic properties for green ammonia synthesis."

    "abstract": "Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a biodegradable plastic derived from starch, has gained prominence as a sustainable alternative to petroleum‐based plastics. However, the slow degradation of PLA in natural environments and contamination of recycling streams due to incompatibility with other plastics highlight the need for efficient recycling techniques. This study reports a sustainable closed‐loop PLA recycling strategy by hydrolysis depolymerization under moist‐solid condition and recovery of the valuable monomer lactic acid. By employing ball milling and resonance acoustic mixing, the effects of milling speed, time, ball size, alkali type, and ageing on lactate yield are investigated, to optimize the performance and the efficiency of mechanical and moist‐solid conditions in polymer chain scission without bulk heating is demonstrated. Furthermore, a bipolar membrane electrodialysis process for conversion of lactate to lactic acid is integrated with simultaneous NaOH production, enhancing the sustainability of the recycling process. Life‐cycle assessment (LCA) is employed to assess the environmental impact of such PLA recycling approach for lactic acid production and provide recommendations for future improvements. This work demonstrates the effectiveness and environmental benefits of mechanically induced moist‐solid chemical recycling and integration with advanced membrane separation processes, offering a promising pathway for sustainable PLA waste management and lactic acid production."

    "abstract": "Biomass waste, a renewable energy source, can be converted into electricity through electrochemical processes. Liquid catalytic fuel cells (LCFCs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to utilize complex biomass fuels directly. However, conventional LCFCs face challenges related to the cross‐membrane permeation of catalysts, which leads to electrolyte imbalance and cell failure. To address the issue, this study proposed a novel LCFC system using the same catalyst, molybdovanadophosphoric heteropolyacid (PMoV), on both the anode and cathode, effectively mitigating catalyst permeation. Under ambient conditions, the PMoV‐LCFC system achieved a maximum power density of 3.39 mW cm−2 using glucose as the fuel, and the system demonstrated stable performance over five days. Notably, cyclic discharge tests using expired bread as fuel further show the system's effectiveness. The total organic carbon degradation rate reached a maximum of 23.36%, and formic acid was the primary intermediate. The PMoV‐LCFC system effectively reduced catalyst crossover and maintained stable electrochemical performance, offering new insights for designing biomass fuel cells and significantly contributing to waste management."

    "abstract": "The removal of molecular iodine (I2/I3−) from aqueous environments are of great importance due to their biological relevance and environmental concerns, particularly in nuclear waste management. In this work, we have demonstrated a hydrophobic tetrapodal receptor Se4Me‐PF6, that exhibits iodine adsorption from an aqueous phase via chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction. In the solution phase, NMR studies reveal that Se4Me‐PF6 selectively recognizes iodide (I−) over other anions. On the other hand, in the solid state, selenoimidazolium building units of Se4Me‐PF6 facilitate self‐assembly into a porous 1D supramolecular ChB framework, enabling efficient iodine adsorption. Consequently, Se4Me‐PF6 has propelled the rapid adsorption of iodine, with a high kinetic rate of 2.10 × 10−3 g·mg−1·min−1, while maintaining its effectiveness under competitive environmental conditions, including pH variations and the presence of interfering anions. Mechanistic investigations using XPS, and DFT studies indicate that iodine capture occurs via a combination of ChB interactions and electrostatic forces provided by the selenoimidazolium motifs. Importantly, Se4Me‐PF6 demonstrates its potential as a stationary phase for column‐based iodine removal, highlighting its applicability in real‐world scenarios. Thus, these findings offer a promising approach for developing iodine adsorbent materials."

    "abstract": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which produces propylene and by‐produces hydrogen, attracts considerable attention in the chemical industry. Alkali metals, budget friendly and commonly used as additives to optimize the performance of Pt‐based alloy catalysts, are extensively utilized in the PDH industry. Herein, the structure and catalytic performance of the commercial catalyst (PtK2/θ‐Al2O3) and contrast samples (Pt0.3K0.8/θ‐Al2O3‐N and Pt0.3/θ‐Al2O3) are analyzed. According to the catalytic test, the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 exhibits better catalytic performance, which achieves >95% propylene selectivity and maintaining a high propane yield (>36%) during stability testing. Observations reveal that the initial propylene selectivity of the Pt‐based catalysts is inversely correlated with the total acidity and strong acid site content. The introducing of K element significantly reduces the acidity of the catalyst and enhances the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the presence of Cl−, co‐introduced with K, improves the catalytic stability, while the slight increase in the acidity of catalysts decreases the propylene selectivity. The enrichment of the electron density of PtK2 nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggest that lower propylene adsorption energy and higher barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation reaction on the PtK2‐(100) surface enhance the propylene selectivity of the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 catalyst."

However, its current practical commercial application is still constrained by short cycle life and low coulombic efficiency. This review focuses on the latest research advances in the design of AFSMBs structures and systems in recent years，including the fundamentals of the operation and the problems that exist. Strategies for the design of current collectors and electrolytes as well as some advanced characterization methods are highlighted. Finally, the summary and outlook on this emerging field are further discussed, with a view to providing guidance for the future design of high energy density AFSMBs."

    "abstract": "Deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) with intrinsic nonflammability is deemed as a promising electrolyte candidate for high safety sodium‐metal batteries (SMBs). Nevertheless, the leakage risk and inferior electrode compatibility impede their further application toward high‐performance SMBs. Herein, a novel DEE based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSi) and ethyl‐2‐cyano‐3‐ethoxyacrylate (ECE) is developed through their Lewis acid–base interaction and the further ECE‐based deep eutectic gel electrolyte (GE) is constructed with cross‐linked ploy(vinylene carbonate) (PVC) as matrix network. It is demonstrated that incorporating electron‐withdrawing PVC polymer into the ECE‐based DEE changes the coordination environment of Na+ ions, thus facilitating the Na‐ions desolvation and transport and leading to a high transference number of Na‐ions (0.7). Moreover, the strong interaction between PVC chains and Na‐ions can induce the preferential reduction of PVC to form O‐rich inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thus promoting the electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability with superior long‐term cycling stability. Benefiting from the stable SEI layer, the Na3V2(PO4)3//Na cell with GE displays outstanding cycling (capacity retention of 94.5% after 300 cycles at 1C) and rate (high capacity of 75.5 mAh g−1 at 2 °C) performance than that of ECE‐based DEE cell, showcasing the promising application of advanced deep eutectic GE in high performance SMBs."

    "abstract": "We study the synthesis and properties of PdAg electrodes coated on Ni foam and their application in the selective electro‐oxidation of ethylene glycol to glycolate. This reaction is a route to glycolic acid, which is a key component of biodegradable packaging. Using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, EDX and XRD analysis, we find that a 3:1 Pd:Ag ratio gives optimal results. We show that the oxidation of ethylene glycol on palladium occurs between 0.3 and 1.2 V vs. RHE, and depends on the presence of a Pd(0) active site. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy experiments show that the charge‐transfer resistance (RCT) follows the same trend as EGOPd activity, with the 3:1 Pd:Ag electrode having the lowest RCT. Electrolysis with this electrode at 0.705 V vs. RHE, where Pd is reduced, results in glycolate production with no overoxidation to formate or oxalate. We then move to a flow setup under industrial conditions, and show that the Pd‐Ni electrode yields >80% FE to glycolate for over 140 h. Long‐term electrode deactivation can be overcome in this system by a periodic self‐refresh cycle."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Fe and N-doped biochar (FeN-BC) was synthesized from waste bamboo through microwave pyrolysis and used as a catalyst for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) with peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The results showed that doping with Fe improved the recovery performance of biochar and the N-doping enhanced the activity of PMS. Simultaneously, it achieved a high degradation efficiency for TC (93%) under optimized conditions within 30 min. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments indicated that the main active radicals present in the experiment were SO4•− and •OH. Additionally, FeN-BC demonstrated good catalytic performance in the TC degradation process in a real water environment after five cycles. This work presents a practical strategy for preparing magnetic biochar to degrade organic pollutants from wastewater."

    "abstract": "Metalloporphyrins, owing to their structural resemblance to natural enzyme active sites and highly tunable coordination environments, have emerged as promising catalysts for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation."

In order to increase the yield of the finished product, develop porosity, and improve the sorption characteristics of the buckwheat husk, methods for its physical and chemical modification are proposed. The effect of the modification modes on the parameters of the porous structure, as well as the sorption capacity of the developed materials for various types of oil products, was studied. The selection of the optimal parameters of the buckwheat husk modification was carried out, ensuring the production of effective unsinkable sorbents based on the buckwheat husk with a reserve buoyancy of more than 20 days and a high sorption capacity of sorbents for oil of up to 6.1 g/g and waste motor oil of up to 4.9 g/g. The use of the buckwheat husk as a sorbent allows not only the elimination of oil pollution on both water and surfaces but also solving the problem of the disposal of agricultural waste."

    "abstract": "Although calcium phosphate bone cement has some advantages (it is easy to form, self-curing, and does not produce heat), some disadvantages remain that limit its clinical application. Therefore, the question of how we can modify CPC and further improve the various properties of calcium phosphate bone cement is a current research hotspot. In this paper, the preparation conditions and technology of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) were optimized; chitosan oligosaccharide (COSM) with MW ≤ 3000 Da was added to the optimal formulation of biphasic calcium phosphate cement particles, and its physical and chemical properties were characterized. The results showed that BCP bone cement carrier for clinical operations was successfully constructed by the high-temperature solid-state reaction method, and COSM-BCP bone cement particles were obtained by loading COSM drugs with an angiogenesis effect. Its formula is biphasic calcium phosphate powder with the molar ratio of α-TCP/β-TCP of 1. The curing time of the prepared BCP particles is 24 ± 1 min, the compressive strength is 29.58 ± 1.89 MPa, and the porosity reaches 52.09%. The loaded COSM can be released continuously and stably in vitro, and has the effect of promoting angiogenesis. The safety evaluation of COSM-BCP bone cement particles and the preliminary pharmacodynamic study of its angiogenesis in vitro provide a promising clinical application basis for the development of drug-loaded biological bone substitute materials."

    "abstract": "Investigating the adsorption properties of emulsifiers at water–oil interfaces enables advances in the comprehension of the mechanisms governing emulsion ageing and stabilization. The utilization of natural compounds in emulsion formulations is increasingly relevant for those applications where it is challenging to maintain a low impact on the environment and health. We report here a study on saponin and chitosan at the interface between water and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil in relation to the properties of the corresponding emulsions. Complementary experimental approaches have been adopted to investigate interfacial properties and emulsion evolution, relying on drop tensiometry, optical and confocal microscopy, and light transmission/scattering analysis. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation has been undertaken as support for the interpretation of the experimental results. The multi-technique investigation adopted here enabled a better understanding of saponin adsorption properties and of the role of chitosan in emulsion evolution. In particular, the results evidence the formation of amphiphilic saponin–chitosan complexes, which adsorb at the liquid–liquid interface and improve the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Since the system investigated mainly consists of natural compounds, the results of this work can contribute to the development of new and efficient low-impact formulations."

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are important acidic subcellular organelles whose dysfunction can lead to some related diseases. The development of new lysosome-imaging-guided AIEgens for the photodynamic therapy of cancer cells is important. In this work, two novel organic compounds with AIE characteristics, namely, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3, were designed and synthesized by introducing the weakly basic morpholinyl moiety with lysosome-targeting ability into a triphenylamine-based luminogen. The distorted spatial feature of TPA and the D1-D2-π-A structure of these AIEgens prevented the aggregation-caused quenching of traditional fluorescent molecules and efficiently promoted the separation of the HOMO and LUMO. The outcomes were AIE features and a narrow single-triplet energy gap. Furthermore, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3 showed bright yellow fluorescence emission peaks at 577 and 601 nm; large Stokes shifts of 234 and 256 nm, respectively; and excellent lysosome-targeted imaging of HeLa cells (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.90). In addition to the good 1O2-generation ability under light irradiation, these AIEgens achieved the high-efficiency bright lysosome imaging-guided photodynamic killing of cancer cells under white-light irradiation."

This study assessed the effects of ovophospholipids on lymphocyte subsets in non-immunized mice and on the humoral immune response in sheep red blood cells (SRBC)-immunized mice. Ovophospholipids were administered orally for 14 days (once a day) at doses of 100, 10, and 1 mg/kg. Ovophospholipids increased the total lymphocyte count of in the lymphoid organs. At 10 and 1 mg/kg, ovophospholipids increased the subsets of CD4−CD8− and CD4+CD8+ thymocytes but decreased the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. A stimulating effect on splenocytes was particularly evident 24 h after administration of the 10 and 1 mg/kg doses. Ovophospholipids also elevated the absolute counts of CD3+ and CD19+ splenocytes. An increase in the absolute count of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes of the mesenteric lymph nodes was observed 24 h after administration of the lowest dose. The increase in the percentage and absolute count of CD19+ cells and in the absolute count of CD3+ cells was still observed after 72 h. At all doses, ovophospholipids elevated the number of plaque-forming cells on day 4 and increased 2-mercaptoethanol-resistant antibody titer on day 7 after priming. In conclusion, ovophospholipids can modulate the immune response in mice."

    "abstract": "The overconsumption of fossil energy sources has resulted in serious environmental impacts and an ensuing energy crisis. Therefore, the search for a new alternative energy technology has become a focus of attention. The long-established Fischer–Tropsch synthesis technology and the recent CO2 hydrogenation technology with unlimited potential seem to be among the ways to solve the above problems. Among them, the development of efficient Fe-based catalysts has become a key issue. Weaker interactions on carbon supports are more favourable for the formation of active phases in Fe-based catalysts than stronger metal–support interactions on conventional oxide supports. In this work, we systematically summarise the application of various types of carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, graphene, activated carbon, etc.) in COx hydrogenation reactions. The effects of different structural types of carriers on the dispersion of active sites are discussed. At the same time, the effects of different carrier preparation methods on catalytic performance are compared. In addition, the role of surface modifications to carbon materials in the promotion of active sites is discussed. Finally, we propose possible research directions based on the current problems in these catalytic systems. The aim is to provide a reference for the development of new carbon materials and their application in COx hydrogenation."

    "abstract": "Indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Previous studies in airway smooth muscle demonstrated that chronic exposure to testosterone (TES, 40 nM) enhances the relaxation induced by salbutamol and theophylline due to K+ channel increment, without modifying cyclooxygenase expression. This study examines how indomethacin, ibuprofen, and ASA affect K+ currents and the relaxation response to these bronchodilators. In organ baths, tracheas from young male guinea pigs chronically (48 h) treated with 40 nM TES showed increased relaxation to salbutamol and theophylline, which was completely abolished by indomethacin. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that TES increased salbutamol- and theophylline-induced K+ currents, and only indomethacin fully inhibited this potentiation; ibuprofen and ASA had partial effects. The involved currents included voltage-dependent K+ (KV) and high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. Our results demonstrate that indomethacin exerts a dual action, inhibiting K+ channel activity and PG synthesis, unlike ibuprofen and ASA. This dual mechanism explains its stronger inhibitory effect on TES-enhanced ASM relaxation. These findings suggest that indomethacin may counteract the protective effects of TES, which promotes anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle-relaxing states. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution when prescribing indomethacin to young males with asthma, as the protective role of TES may diminish, potentially resulting in an exacerbation of asthma symptoms."

    "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials (CMs) have gained great attention as heterogeneous catalysts in water treatment because of their high efficiency and potential contribution to achieving carbon neutrality. Expanded graphite (EG) is ideal for studying CMs because the reactivity in CMs largely depends on graphitic structures, and most surface of EG is exposed, minimizing mass transfer resistance. However, EG is poor in adsorption and catalysis. In this study, EG was modified by simple thermal treatment to investigate the effects of characteristics of graphitic structures on reactivity. Tetracycline (TC) removal rate via activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) by the EG treated at 550 °C (EG550) was more than 10 times that of EG. The thermal modification did not significantly increase surfaces but led to increases in damaged, rough surfaces, graphitization degree, C content, defects, and C=O. Radical and non-radical pathways, such as SO4•−, O2•−, 1O2, and electron transfer, were involved in TC removal in EG550+PDS. TC degradation in EG550+PDS was initiated by hydroxylation, followed by demethylation, dehydroxylation, decarbonylation, and ring-opening. The ions ubiquitous in water systems did not significantly affect the performance of EG550+PDS, except for H2PO4− and HCO3−, suggesting the high potential of practical applications. This study demonstrated that graphitic structure itself and surface area are not detrimental in the catalytic reactivity of CMs, which is different from previous studies. Rather, the reactivity is governed by the characteristics, i.e., defects and functional groups of the graphitic structure. It is thought that this study provides valuable insights into the development of highly reactive CMs and the catalytic systems using them."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of mephedrone on selected human glioblastoma (LN-18, LN-229, T98G) and human anaplastic astrocytoma (MOGGCCM) cell lines. The effects of mephedrone on cell viability and proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression and the type of cell death were studied. Our results showed that mephedrone possesses potential anticancer activity. The viability and proliferation of all four human glioblastoma and human anaplastic astrocytoma cell lines used were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Studies conducted on LN-18 and T98G cells confirmed the significant antiproliferative properties of mephedrone, which reduced DNA synthesis and affected cell cycle progression. Microscopic evaluation supported the antiproliferative effect of the tested compounds. Moreover, substantial cytoplasmic vacuolization in the LN-18 cell line was revealed. This finding may indicate the potential of mephedrone in anticancer therapy."

The upconversion system consists of Pd-tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(p-methoxycarbonylphenyl)-tetraanthraporphyrin (PdTAP) as the sensitizer to harvest NIR photons and rubrene as the annihilator to generate upconverted photons via triplet fusion. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra reveal that CsPbI3 QDs are energized via radiative energy transfer from the singlet excited rubrene with photophysics fidelity of respective components. In addition, a volumetric display demo incorporating CsPbI3 QDs as light emitters employing triplet fusion upconversion was developed, showing bright luminescent images from CsPbI3 QDs. These results present the feasibility of integrating organic light-harvesting systems and perovskite QDs, enabling diverse light harvesting and activation of perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications."

    "abstract": "In the natural environment, mechanical energy is widely available as a sustainable and green energy source. In this paper, we successfully convert mechanical energy on ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 tribocatalysts via a friction route. Electrons were transferred across the contact interface when the catalyst particles and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-sealed magnetic bar rubbed against each other under magnetic stirring. At the same time, holes were left on the catalyst while the PTFE absorbed the electrons. Similar to photocatalysis, organic pollutants can be effectively oxidized by the holes in the valence band of sol-gel catalysts due to their strong oxidative ability. The tribocatalytic tests demonstrated that ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 could eliminate organic analgesics (paracetamol) under magnetic stirring in the dark. By controlling the quantity of rare earth elements (1, 2, and 3 mol%), stirring speed, and the number of magnetic rods, we could further enhance the tribocatalytic performance. In addition to developing a green tribocatalysis approach for the oxidative purification of organic pollutants, this work offers a potential route for converting environmental mechanical energy into chemical energy, which could be used in sustainable energy and environmental remediation."

    "abstract": "With the worsening global water pollution crisis, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments. The effective removal of PPCPs remains challenging for conventional water treatment technologies, whereas photocatalytic technology has shown distinct promise. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a ubiquitous component of aquatic ecosystems, exerts multifaceted effects on the photocatalytic oxidation of PPCPs. In this article, the influence of DOM on the performance of various photocatalysts in PPCP removal is systematically summarized and analyzed. This review highlights DOM’s role in altering the migration and transformation of PPCPs via processes including adsorption and complexation. The adsorption of PPCPs on photocatalysts is achieved by competitive adsorption or by providing more adsorption sites. DOM modifies the structural properties of photocatalysts through mechanisms such as ligand exchange, intermolecular forces, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions. DOM inhibits the formation of active species via light attenuation and shielding effects while simultaneously enhancing their generation through photosensitization and electron transfer facilitation. In this review, the interaction mechanism among DOM, PPCPs, and photocatalysts within the PPCP photocatalytic oxidation system is expounded on. These findings provide novel insights into optimizing photocatalytic reaction conditions and enhancing treatment efficiency, while providing a theoretical foundation for advancing efficient, eco-friendly PPCPs remediation technologies."

    "abstract": "Carbon nanofibrous materials from electrospinning are good candidate electrode materials for supercapacitor applications due to their straightforward processability, chemical stability, high porosity, and large surface area. In this research, a straightforward and effective way was revealed to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon nanofibrous electrode material from electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Fluorination of the electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNF) was studied by comparing two types of hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment, i.e., direct HF acid treatment on ECNF (Type I) vs. HF acid treatment on the stabilized PAN (Type II) followed by carbonization. The latter was found to be an advantageous way to introduce C-F bonds in the resultant carbon nanofibrous electrode material that contributed to pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the Type II HF acid treatment demonstrated exciting synergistic effects with ECNF aerogel formation on carbon structure and porosity development and generated a superior fluorinated electrospun carbon nanofibrous aerogel (ECNA-F) electrode material for supercapacitor uses. The resultant ECNA-F electrode material demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with great cyclic stability due to the large improvements in both pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance. ECNA-F achieved a specific capacitance of 372 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, and the device with ECNA-F and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte possessed an energy density of 29.1 Wh/kg at a power density of 275 W/kg. This study provided insight into developing high-performance and stable carbon nanofibrous electrode materials for supercapacitors."

    "abstract": "Chitosan (CS)-based films have demonstrated significant potential as biodegradable packaging materials, but their suboptimal barrier and mechanical properties limit practical applications. In this study, CS/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) composite films were prepared using a NaOH/urea-based alkaline system. Optimal ratios (1.5% CS, 2% CMC, 2.5% NaOH, and 4% urea) were determined through an L16(44) orthogonal array design. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed the formation of stable physical crosslinks between CS and CMC via hydrogen bonding. These interactions significantly enhanced mechanical properties (tensile strength: 46.08 MPa; elongation at break: 68%), improved thermal stability (maximum decomposition temperature: 304 °C), and superior barrier properties (water vapor transmission rate: 0.26 × 10−5 g/(m2·h·Pa); oxygen transmission rate: 1.12 × 10−4 g/(m2·s)). NaOH concentration exhibited the most pronounced influence on film performance. The composite film combines inherent biodegradability with excellent functional properties, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional petroleum-based packaging materials."

Recent studies have found that electronic structure calculations are important factors in controlling the performance of MPs as building blocks for single-molecule devices. Our study investigates metalloporphyrins with central 3d-metals from Sc to Cu and chalcogen containing anchoring groups such as -SH, -SeH, and -TeH substituted at the meso-position of the porphyrin rings. We carried out Density Function Theory (DFT)-based calculations to determine the ground state geometry, spin multiplicity, spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals, and electronic structure descriptors to gain insights into the reactivity trends and possible impact on factors influencing electron transport properties. The results suggest that the central metal shapes the spin multiplicity, while variations between sulfur, selenium, and tellurium play a role in charge distribution. This study provides insights into how the selection of the central metal and control of spin channels influence the electronic structure and reactivity of metalloporphyrin molecules. The knowledge provided here can play a role in the design of porphyrin-based molecular materials for diverse applications in molecular junctions, catalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing."

SOD1 mutations have a significant role in the pathophysiology and fast behavior of protopathic proteins in ALS illness. The E100K mutation may be useful in uncovering the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1 associated with ALS. According to several studies, giving small molecule inhibitors made from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds may be a viable treatment strategy for neurological conditions. Using molecular docking and MD simulations, we have identified a potential flavonoid drug that may successfully inhibit SOD1’s amyloidogenic activity. Puerarin, Fisetin, and Peonidin provided intriguing pharmacological hints during the initial screening of flavonoids. The Fisetin-E100K complex had a larger residual energy contribution and substantial binding than other flavonoid compounds. The findings showed that, unlike other materials, Fisetin increased the structural stability, hydrophobicity, and flexibility of the mutant while reducing the amount of β-sheets. Furthermore, to distinguish aggregation in the mutant (unbound/bound) states, we displayed modifications in the free energy landscape (FEL). As a result, Fisetin was identified as having therapeutic potential against the E100K, which might make it a viable pharmacological option for the creation of inhibitors that lower the chance of ALS death."

This study reports for the first time the implementation of the microbial dye violacein, obtained by Janthinobacterium lividum batch cultivation, as SERS probe, as a suitable substitutive to the most employed toxic chemical dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G).

The SERS devices developed were decorated by applying a single-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) decoration method and characterized using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The platform showed a remarkable sensitivity, achieving a detection limit of 10–7 M for violacein, allowing to point out the strong potential of this natural microbial dye as a sustainable probe molecule for low-concentration analytes detection on SERS-active substrates, making them suitable for several application fields, such as environmental monitoring, food safety, cultural heritage analysis and diagnostics.

Despite its importance, the specific details regarding N/O-glycosylation within human semen proteins have largely remained unknown. To address this challenge, an integrated glycoproteomic platform (termed GlycoIP) was developed, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both intact N- and O-glycopeptides directly from human semen samples. Characterizing these intact glycopeptides is particularly challenging, yet it provides invaluable insights into the structure and function of both glycans and their attachment sites. In this study, our platform enabled the identification of 1,833 unique N-glycopeptides and 720 unique O-glycopeptides. This approach revealed extensive and precise site-specific N/O-glycosylation data, highlighting 438 potential O-glycosylation sites from 148 distinct O-glycoproteins. Notably, we conducted site-specific N/O-glycosylation profiling on several unique glycoproteins, including sperm equatorial segment protein 1 (SPESP1), which is located on human sperm, and plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), which is presented in both sperm and seminal plasma. In summary, this platform provides a promising approach for comprehensive profiling of protein site-specific N/O-glycosylation within a single experiment. This advancement paves the way for further functional studies on glycoproteins and their roles in male infertility, enhancing our understanding of this complex field."

This study presents a novel pore-scale numerical model to simulate the dynamic process of in situ microemulsion formation during surfactant-cosolvent-salt flooding in complex porous media. Through comprehensive numerical simulations based on realistic rock geometries, we systematically investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of phase distributions and identified critical mechanisms governing oil mobilization. The developed model incorporates four fundamental characteristics of microemulsion systems: interfacial tension reduction, viscosity modification, wettability alteration, and enhanced solubilization capacity. During the microemulsion-forming surfactant flooding in a realistic rock medium, the in situ formed microemulsion was observed at the interface between oil and aqueous. The in situ microemulsion flooding can significantly improve the recovery rate under the combined effect of multiple factors. Increasing the viscosity of the in situ formed microemulsion can enhance the oil recovery during the microemulsion-forming surfactant flooding in the complex porous media. Under water-wet conditions, the oil-water interface stays at the junction of the throat and the pore space, which contributes to the formation of microemulsions and thus to the enhancement of recovery. This study provides a better understanding of the in situ microemulsion formation and the mechanisms of enhanced oil recovery in complex porous media."

Lysine substitution (brevinin-1pl-6K) decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria due to reduced hydrophobicity. In contrast, histidine substitution (brevinin-1pl-3H) showed diminished activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., MRSA MIC increased from 2 µM to 4 µM) but reduced hemolysis, indicating improved selectivity. Mechanistic studies using SYTOX green assays confirmed membrane disruption as a primary mode of action, while suggesting alternative mechanisms for Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The brevinin-1pl and its analogues demonstrated significant inhibitory efficacy against both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and H838 non-small cell lung cancer cells at a concentration of 10–4 M. Notably, brevinin-1pl-3H exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal HaCaT cells despite its high hydrophobicity, suggesting potential for dermatological applications.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that strategic amino acid substitutions can optimize the therapeutic potential of AMPs, offering a promising approach to develop peptides with enhanced efficacy and reduced clinical side effects."

Gasification experiments were conducted on the treated coal. Meanwhile, its microscopic properties were tested by industrial analysis, mercury pressure method and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method.ResultsFirstly, non-focusing microwaves achieve more stable gasification despite comparable gas production durations. Secondly, focused microwaves enhance energy absorption and reduce coal moisture, while non-focusing radiation alters coal composition by increasing volatile matter and decreasing fixed carbon. Finally, non-focusing modes improve coal combustibility and reduce particulate emissions with minimal environmental impact, contrasting with focused microwaves limited ecological effects. Both methods similarly reduce coal porosity and pore volume.DiscussionThis work compares gasification performance and physicochemical changes under both modalities, revealing three critical differences.

We have used two types of oxide nanoparticles, namely, Al2O3 and γ- Al2O3, with water and C2H6O2. The purpose of this study is to investigate an innovative comparative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid flow and heat transport with the impact of thermal radiation on water and ethylene glycol (EG) suspended with Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. A novel comparison of concentration of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ Al2O3–C2H6O2 nanofluids is investigated under the influence of chemical reactions. The system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was obtained via a similarity transformation and then solved using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) in Mathematica. The temperature and velocity profiles are obtained numerically for a range of controlling parameter values, including the volume percentage φ of nanomaterials, the magnetic effect parameter M, the radiation parameter Rd, and Eckert number Ec in convergent/divergent channels. The concentration profiles of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 tri-nanofluids are calculated numerically for governing parameter values, including those accounting for chemical reactions. The investigation’s findings indicate that there is greater heat transport in γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 and γ-Al2O3–H2O than in Al2O3–H2O. We have demonstrated that there is good agreement between the current results and those found in the literature for various values of the magnetic field parameter, thermal radiation parameter, and nanoparticle volume fraction."

    "abstract": "Trifluoromethylation stands as a pivotal technology in modern synthetic chemistry, playing an indispensable role in drug design, functional material development, and agrochemical innovation. With the growing emphasis on green chemistry principles, the pursuit of environmentally benign trifluoromethylation strategies has emerged as a critical research frontier. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), characterized by its cost-effectiveness, stability, and low toxicity, has become a promising alternative to conventional trifluoromethylation reagents. This review systematically summarizes advancements in photocatalytic decarboxylative trifluoromethylation using TFA and its derivatives over the past decade, focusing on three key activation mechanisms: single-electron transfer (SET), electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-mediated pathways, and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This paradigm shift is driven by the intrinsic limitations of conventional thermal decarboxylation, particularly its reliance on harsh conditions and significant environmental burdens. In contrast, photocatalytic strategies enable efficient C–CF3 bond construction under mild conditions, offering a modular platform for synthesizing fluorinated functional molecules. Strategic research priorities should focus on overcoming fundamental challenges, including but not limited to optimizing photosensitizer catalytic efficiency, establishing regioselective manipulation strategies, and engineering multicomponent tandem reaction systems to achieve trifluoromethylation methodologies under mild conditions. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic investigations with artificial intelligence-driven reaction prediction will accelerate the advancement of precision trifluoromethylation technologies. This progress is anticipated to provide sustainable synthetic solutions for next-generation fluorinated pharmaceuticals and advanced functional materials, effectively bridging the innovation gap between academic research and industrial implementation."

    "abstract": "IntroductionAlcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is a common consequence of chronic alcohol consumption, characterized by lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes play essential roles in metabolizing alcohol and other compounds. However, the specific long-term effects of alcohol on these enzymes remain unclear.MethodsThis study the examines influence of prolonged ethanol exposure on CYP450 activity and expression in AFLD using a rat model. Key enzymes such as CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1 were assessed in relation to lipid accumulation and oxidative stress.ResultsSignificant alterations were identified in the expression and activity of CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1, which were associated with increased lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Additionally, the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was elevated, suggesting that chronic alcohol intake may impact drug transport and excretion.DiscussionThese findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AFLD and highlight the potential of CYP450 modulation as a therapeutic target. By elucidating how long-term ethanol exposure disrupts hepatic CYP450 enzyme profiles, this research lays the groundwork for developing personalized therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients with AFLD."

The core dihydropyridine (DHP) scaffold, an isostere of nifedipine, was synthesized using three aldehydes incorporated with trifluoromethyl (–CF3) substitutions at the ortho, meta, and para positions. The resulting series (4a–c to 9a–c) was evaluated for antihypertensive and calcium channel-blocking activities in male and female rats, administered intraperitoneally. Among the synthesized compounds, the ortho-substituted derivatives (4a, 7a, 8a, and 9a) demonstrated the highest antihypertensive activity, exhibiting approximately 30% efficacy relative to nifedipine. These compounds also displayed IC50 values comparable to nifedipine and were further assessed for binding affinity with 6M7H and 4MS2 through molecular docking studies. The final DHP derivatives were amides, synthesized through reactions with aniline, 4-methylaniline, and 4-nitroaniline. Notably, compound 9a exhibited the highest docking score against both tested receptor proteins, highlighting its potential for further investigation."

    "abstract": "Today, wastewater treatment is essential and inevitable due to the water crisis caused by climate change and population growth. Although numerous methods and synthetic compounds have been successful in practical and laboratory applications, developing novel multifunctional compounds remains of interest to scientists. For this purpose, a new nanofiber containing Cobalt-MOF (metal-organic framework), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which are known environmentally friendly polymers, was synthesized. After characterization and structure determination, the nanofiber was investigated for its ability to adsorb Congo Red dye and inhibit known microbial species in wastewater. This study showed that 91% of the 400 mg/L Congo red solution was absorbed by 0.06 g/L of the synthesized Cobalt-MOF/PVA-PVP Nanofibers at 1 h. Additionally, seven well-known strains (including Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Giardia lamblia) in wastewater were inhibited (with MIC of 8 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL) to the extent that some antibiotics could not affect them. This performance of the newly synthesized nanofiber can be attributed to its physical, chemical, and structural characteristics, such as compounds with biological properties present in its structure, as well as its high specific surface area. Therefore, researching and synthesizing similar compounds using the method presented in this study can lead to their development and application in wastewater treatment processes."

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a key target for metabolic disorders that contribute to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, full agonists such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have limitations in terms of side effects. Selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARγMs) that target alternative binding pockets offer the potential for safer partial agonists. Here, we employed six computational algorithms (Fpocket, DeepSite, CavityPlus, DoGSiteScorer, CASTpFold, POCASA) to identify a novel allosteric pocket (pocket 6–5) in the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD), localized at the helix 3 (H3), helix 2 (H2), helix 2'(H2′), and β-sheet interface. A virtual screening of 4,097 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) libraries was conducted, which led to the identification of ginsenoside Rg5 (TWSZ-5) as a top hit. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) dynamics revealed TWSZ-5 stabilizes pocket 6–5 through hydrogen bonds with Ser342, Gln345, Lys261, and Lys263. TWSZ-5 promoted beige adipocyte differentiation in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in vitro, upregulating Ucp1, Prdm16, Cpt1α, and Pgc1α. The present study identifies TWSZ-5 as a novel SPPARγM that utilizes an allosteric binding pocket to enhance thermogenesis while mitigating adverse effects. These findings emphasize the potential of TCM derivatives and structure-based screening strategies to develop safer antidiabetic therapies with precision pharmacology."

    "abstract": "The development of highly efficient, recyclable adsorbents for heavy metal remediation remains a critical challenge in environmental engineering. This study introduces a novel cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized magnesium silicate (CTAB/MS) nano-adsorbent was synthesized through a multi-step surface modification of serpentinite involving intercalation with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol treatment, and CTAB incorporation. The resulting nanostructure was extensively characterized and applied for the removal of cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), and copper (Cu2+) ions from contaminated water. The characterization findings confirmed significant morphological and structural modifications, including enhanced surface area, functional group availability, and mesoporosity, which contributed to enhanced adsorption performance. The kinetic modeling confirmed that the process predominantly followed a pseudo-first-order model, suggesting that rapid physisorption mechanisms controlled the initial adsorption phase. Equilibrium studies revealed that adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous active sites, with maximum adsorption capacities of 491.9 mg/g (Cd2+), 481.8 mg/g (Co2+), and 434.3 mg/g (Cu2+) at 303 K. Furthermore, statistical physics-based isotherm model incorporating steric and energetic parameters provided deeper mechanistic insights. The adsorption energy (ΔE) values remained below 12.66 kJ/mol, confirming a predominantly physical adsorption process, while thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic and spontaneous nature, as evidenced by negative free enthalpy (G) and internal energy (Eint) values. The recyclability assessment demonstrated that CTAB/MS retained over 70% of its adsorption efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles, underscoring its long-term applicability in water treatment. This highlights the potential of CTAB/MS as an advanced, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for large-scale water purification."

    "abstract": "IntroductionAstragali Radix (AR) - Curcumae Rhizoma (vinegar processed, CR) herb pair was recorded in ‘YIXUE ZHONGZHONG CANXILU’ to treat colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Hedysari Radix (HR) was categorized under the AR entry in ‘SHENNONG BENCAO JING’. HR is still an alternative to AR paired with CR clinically in northwest China. Hedysari Radix Praeparata Cum Melle (HRPCM) is a product that HR fries with honey to enhance the therapeutic effect. However, the mechanism of HRPCM paired with CR (HRCR) in CAC needs to be further elucidated.MethodsHRCR-MIAS were prepared using the eversion intestinal sac method. UHPLC Q-Exactive-MS investigated the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. Then, the mechanism of HRCR in CAC mice was predicted based on network pharmacology analysis in combination with the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. The pharmacodynamic effects of HRCR-MIAS for SW620 colon cancer cells were invested in vitro. The efficacies of HRCR low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (HRCR-L, 3.413 g/kg; HRCR-M, 6.825 g/kg; HRCR-H, 13.650 g/kg) in CAC mice were explored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to assay The inflammatory factors levels, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum. The expressions of the intestinal permeability proteins, such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1, were detected via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Finally, the predicted signalling was verified by Western blot (WB).Results855 common components were identified in HRCR and HRCR-MIAS, and 25 specific components in HRCR-MIAS were pointed out. Based on network pharmacology analysis, the inflammatory response and the cross-linked MAPK signalling and NF-kB signalling were predicted to be the main reasons for HRCR in CAC. HRCR-MIAS inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, regulated the cell cycle progression, and restrained the SW620 cells’ ability to migrate and invade in vitro. The outcomes of the WB experiment exhibited that HRCR-MIAS inhibited the expression of key proteins such as MEKK1, RAS, ERK, IKB and NF-kB in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling pathway of SW620 cells. The study in vivo found that the different doses of HRCR recovered the loss of body weight, the shortened colon length, the increased tumour counts, the abnormal changes in spleen and thymus indices, the colonic lesions, the unbalanced inflammatory factors levels like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, and the down-regulated intestinal permeability proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Experimental validation by WB confirmed that HRCR inhibited the expression of the key proteins, including MEKK1 RAS, ERK, IKB, and NF-kB, in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling in CAC mice.DiscussionHRCR not only suppresses the process of colonic inflammation and improves intestinal permeability but also relieves CAC by inhibiting the activated MAPK/NF-kB signalling cascade to alleviate CAC."

Studies have demonstrated that CatS plays a pivotal role in antigen presentation and is associated with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity, positioning it as a potential target in related disorders. Consequently, the development of a selective and straightforward method for detecting CatS is crucial. In this study, we introduce a colorimetric approach utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and CatS‐specific peptides for the detection of CatS activity. The CatS enzyme cleavage peptides, PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2, can stabilize AuNPs in a hydrosaline solution without aggregation. Upon hydrolysis of PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 by CatS, the AuNPs aggregate with a color change from red to blue. After optimizing the size of the AuNPs and the concentration of the peptides, the limits of detection for CatS were both to be 10 nM, when PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 were used to protect the AuNPs. Therefore, this colorimetric assay, which employs peptides and AuNPs, enables not only a selective but also a simple detection of CatS, visible to the naked eye."

Most conventional inhibitors are target‐specific and ineffective against broad‐spectrum viral infections. Therefore, the current scenario demands developing inhibitors to attenuate the membrane properties instead of targeting the viral proteins. In the present work, we have designed a new WD‐containing peptide (dmTG‐23) by introducing a WD repeat at the center of the peptide sequence using mTG‐23 peptide as a template and a 14‐amino acid peptide with seven WD repeats (WD‐14), and tested their efficacies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐induced fusion assay. Our findings show that both dmTG‐23 and WD‐14 prevent PEG‐induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol concentrations, with a higher effect for dmTG‐23. Moreover, we have compared our results with our previous observations on TG‐23 and mTG‐23 to evaluate the importance of the number and position of WD repeats in the peptide sequence to impart the highest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that three WD repeat‐containing dmTG‐23 shows the highest efficacy against the PEG‐induced fusion of SUVs by enhancing the membrane order at the acyl chain region.

    "abstract": "AbstractA series of commercial nanosized zeolites and zeolites prepared by in situ seed‐induced synthesis with a ZSM‐5 structure and a close silica modulus were studied to explore the influence of physicochemical characteristics on the dimethyl ether aromatization and catalyst stability. It was shown that a larger strong Brønsted acidity enhanced the total aromatics formation with an increased light arenes content (especially at elevated WHSV). At low WHSV, excess Brønsted acidity leads to the declined aromatics yield due to its high cracking ability. On the contrary, a higher Lewis acidity and extensive mesoporosity promoted the heavier aromatics production accelerating the coke formation and shortening the catalyst lifetime. An improved aromatization performance and a prolonged durability of the zeolite catalyst were controlled by a balanced Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio and the ratio of WHSV to acid site concentration."

    "abstract": "AbstractCrystal defects widely exist in semiconductor photocatalysts, and it hinders the quantum efficiency in photocatalytic reactions. The precise manipulation and elimination of these detrimental defects are particularly crucial for improving the photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) reaction, though this remains a considerable challenge. In a recent study, Wang and colleagues introduced an innovative “in‐situ salt flux” copolymerization technique to synthesize poly(triazine imide) (PTI) with high crystallinity and minimal defects. This approach resulted in a record apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 37.8% at 380 nm. This strategy effectively balances the impact of two types of vacancies (carbon and nitrogen) on OWS performance and establishes clear structure‐property‐activity relationships for the photocatalytic OWS process."

    "abstract": "AbstractTo elucidate the emergence and amplification of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral molecules and their assemblies, we designed positionally isomeric chiral V‐shaped Schiff base ligands and their corresponding bis(boron difluoride) complexes. The ligands were synthesized by condensing chiral cyclohexanediamine with either 1‐hydroxy‐2‐naphthaldehyde or 2‐hydroxy‐1‐naphthaldehyde, followed by complexation with boron difluoride (BF2) to yield CNB1 and CNB2, respectively. While the parent Schiff bases exhibited no CPL, BF2 coordination induced strong CPL signals in solution. Remarkably, upon aggregation in a mixed solvent system, CNB2 displayed enhanced and inverted CPL, whereas its isomer CNB1 showed attenuated emission. Through comprehensive characterization and singlecrystal analysis, we attribute this divergent behavior to distinct molecular packing modes: CNB2 forms tightly stacked aggregates with efficient π─π interactions, while CNB1 adopts a less ordered arrangement. This study establishes a clear correlation between subtle structural modifications, supramolecular packing, and CPL performance, offering a rational strategy for tailoring chiroptical properties through precise molecular design and controlled self‐assembly."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe growing global population and rising demand for pharmaceuticals highlight the need for efficient drug synthesis and detection methods. This study presents a bifunctional imidazole‐functionalized Hf(IV)‐based metal–organic framework (MOF), 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesizing 1,4‐dihydropyridines (1,4‐DHPs), which are key moieties in the synthesis of drugs used for cardiovascular treatments. The solvent‐free activated form of 1, labeled as 1′ catalyzes both Biginelli and Hantzsch reactions under mild conditions. The Biginelli reaction using aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea proceeded at 80 °C in 0.5 h with a 99% yield, while the Hantzsch reaction with aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate occurred at room temperature in ethanol within 1 h, also achieving a 99% yield. Compound 1′ showed broad substrate compatibility in both reactions. Additionally, the MOF exhibited excellent sensing ability for the anticancer drug raloxifene (RLX), showing a fast turn‐off fluorescence response (within 5 s), a low detection limit (9 nM), and a high Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv, 2 × 106 M⁻¹), enabling sensitive detection in diverse environments, including wastewater and biofluids. Detailed investigations into catalytic mechanisms and detection capabilities provide valuable insights for advancing drug synthesis and analytical methodologies.

In this study, we introduce N‐confused porphyrin (NCP) as a highly active ligand scaffold for transition metal‐based catalysts in CO2 reduction reactions. By breaking the D4h symmetry inherent in conventional porphyrin structures, NCP promotes enhanced electron delocalization around corresponding metal complex, improving the catalytic efficiency. A comprehensive study demonstrates that NCP‐based metal complexes (Fe, Co, and Ni) significantly outperform their parent metal‐porphyrin counterparts. These results provide new insights into the design of more effective catalysts for CO2 reduction."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe increasing demand for green and clean energy harvesting and their judicious storage call for pursuing new energy storage technologies. Building better batteries has drawn significant attention to fulfilling the energy demand by delivering the stored electrical energy at the anticipated time and minimal cost. Li‐ion batteries play a crucial role in transitioning to a sustainable energy landscape. However, their safety and environmental issues are of concern. Zn‐based batteries provide more sustainable solutions due to their low cost, enhanced safety, and environmental benignity. Still, poor thermodynamic reversibility and stability of Zn anode in the aqueous electrolytes prevent its practical application. Significant efforts such as Zn anode surface engineering and electrolyte and/or interface modification alleviate these issues. However, in‐depth studies of the root causes associated with the reversibility and stability issues of Zn electrodes are still deficient. Hence, this review focuses on the underlying causes of the major issues (dendrite, hydrogen evolution, corrosion, and passivation) associated with Zn anodes. Furthermore, we have summarized the technological advances that have been made to address these issues. Finally, some promising future directions and perspectives are provided for a further in‐depth understanding of thermodynamic irreversibility and to improve the overall performance of the Zn anode."

In this work, cellulose is derivatized with a thiol‐containing amino acid, cysteine, via two approaches to enhance silver anchoring by exploiting the high affinity between thiol groups and soft metals. The first method involves direct esterification to produce Cel‐Cys‐Est, while the second uses periodate oxidation to form dialdehyde cellulose (DAC), followed by linking with cysteine via a Schiff base reaction, creating DAC‐Cys. After confirming the successful cysteine derivatization using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the adsorption characteristics towards silver ions have been optimized for parameters like pH, adsorbent dosage, and ion concentration. The kinetic studies have shown the pseudo‐second‐order model for silver ion adsorption over both materials, while the isotherm studies have indicated Langmuir‐type monolayer adsorption. The silver‐loaded DAC‐Cys, having higher adsorption capacity, has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work highlights the versatility of cysteine‐derivatized cellulose as an effective, eco‐friendly material for silver ion sequestration and its promising application in antimicrobial domains."

Mechanistic investigations revealed that the formation of stable metallogels is facilitated by a synergistic combination of multiple noncovalent interactions, including Zn(II)‐hydrazide coordination, solvophobic effects, and π─π stacking interactions. These dendritic metallogels exhibited intelligent stimuli‐responsive behavior, undergoing reversible gel–sol phase transitions in response to various external stimuli, such as temperature and chemical inputs. Furthermore, the dendritic metallogel, particularly in its xerogel form, demonstrated exceptional efficacy (>94% within 10 hours) and outstanding adsorption capacity (800 mg/g) in the removal of Hg2⁺ ions from aqueous solutions, highlighting its potential for environmental remediation applications."

The (RO)2P(O) has a distinct effect on the photophysical properties of acenes, increasing QYs by more than twofold compared to identical acenes, not substituted by this group. DFT and TD‐DFT calculations, combined with electron‐hole analysis, indicated that local excitation (LE) had the dominant contribution to the electron excitation mechanism, and charge transfer (CT) of about 30% provided the highest fluorescence quantum yields. Multiply substitution of (hetero)acenes bearing phosphonate moiety and electron‐diverse substituents combined with a lower number of fused aromatic rings, appear to be ideal for optimal chemical stability and high photoluminescence. The new, synthetic tool will accelerate exploitation of bulky (hetero)acene emitters for optoelectronic applications."

    "abstract": "Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) operating at high cut‐off voltages can achieve an energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg‐1; however, they often suffer from severe capacity degradation due to electrolyte decomposition. Herein, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PMA) is introduced as a novel solvent for LMB electrolytes. The unique ether‐oxygen functionality in PMA exhibits high steric hindrance, leading to weak lithium‐ion coordination, which promotes the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the electrolyte solvation structure, especially in the presence of dual salts. A Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery employing the formulated PMA‐based electrolyte demonstrates stable cycling at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.5 V for over 100 cycles, retaining 90.1% of its initial capacity even at 60°C. Furthermore, a molecular interfacial model is proposed to elucidate the impact of the designed electrolyte on electrode interfacial behavior and battery performance, providing valuable insights for the development of high‐performance LMB electrolytes."

    "abstract": "Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio‐economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive and specific in situ virus detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)‐based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN‐based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV‐RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV‐RNA within 12 min in a cell‐free environment, enabling real‐time imaging of JEV‐RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN‐based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs."

    "abstract": "With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point‐of‐care biosensors, two‐dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real‐time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities, enhancing the understanding of human biosystem. Since they are cost‐effective and user‐friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors.  Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area, tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhances their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focussing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in‐depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute towards enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics."

    "abstract": "AbstractFluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti‐counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low‐molecular‐weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent‐colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf‐like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via π‐electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation."

    "abstract": "AbstractSinglet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo‐inactivation of antibiotic‐resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of ¹O₂ following its photo‐catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to ¹O₂ through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500‐fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 µs and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high‐surface charge (>+30 mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary “proof of principle” staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time‐gated measurements, that is, to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples."

    "abstract": "We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non‐activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis‐1,2‐diaminocyclohexane (cis‐DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis‐DACH with 3‐(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com­plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis‐DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol‐% only. The achiral cis‐DACH salan catalyst showed syn‐selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)‐citronellene, and (R)‐linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti‐selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti‐selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)‐citronellene and (R)‐linalool when the \"matched\" enantiomer of the chiral \"Berkessel salalen ligand\" is employed."

DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly non‐bifunctional complexes can operate via inner‐sphere and outer‐sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer‐sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer‐sphere path is found to be supported by π‐π interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene‐based CNC‐ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal‐ligand cooperativity."

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes have attracted interest as an antimicrobial material for wound healing and implant-associated infections due to their bactericidal activity without the use of antibiotics. Hydrogels are frequently used as a delivery system; however, most research uses photonic activation in the form of near-infrared (NIR) laser stimulation to cause rapid BP degradation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and a localized photothermal effect. For implant-coating applications, using NIR laser stimulation could be challenging in practice, especially for porous orthopedic implants. This article investigates whether BP nanoflakes, suspended in Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogels, remain effective against Staphylococcus aureus without photonic activation. The experimental results showed 89.4 ± 7.6% bacterial inhibition from BP nanoflakes at a 5120 µg/mL concentration via passive diffusion in F127; however, it could not kill all the bacteria present. It is hypothesized that the F127 gel interface could create a barrier between the bacteria, which continue to multiply in media, and the antimicrobial black phosphorus compound, which degrades in the F127."

For the first time in this paper, the photophysics of Dx:Fe3O4 composites in water is studied using fluorescence and phosphorescence molecular spectrometry. An analysis of the absorption spectra of the Dx:Fe3O4 composite reveals the broad absorption bands with maxima at wavelengths of 227 nm, 264 nm, and 340 nm. Dx:Fe3O4 composite nanoparticles in water exhibit strong fluorescence with a quantum yield of 0.24% in contrast to 0.07% for dextran. Phosphorescence spectra confirm the formation of new emission bands within the Dx:Fe3O4 solution evidenced by the maxima shift for both dextran and Dx:Fe3O4 composites."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the extraction, characterization, and biological evaluation of diterpenes from green coffee beans, specifically, cafestol and kahweol. These compounds, known for their potential health benefits, were isolated via optimized extraction and saponification processes. Separation was achieved using silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel, and structural elucidation was performed through advanced 1D and 2D NMR techniques, including HSQC, HMBC, and (IN)ADEQUATE. Due to kahweol’s instability, the research prioritized cafestol for the synthesis of rhodamine B conjugates. Initial ester-linked conjugates proved unstable, prompting the development of more robust derivatives through amide linkage strategies and further functionalization via acetylation and oxidation reactions. Some oxidation methods led to furan ring cleavage, impacting structural integrity. Selected compounds were tested for cytotoxicity using SRB assays on human tumor cell lines (MCF7, A2780) and non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). While the parent diterpenes and many derivatives showed minimal activity, several cafestol–rhodamine B conjugates demonstrated notable cytotoxic effects. Compound 6, in particular, exhibited selective activity against cancer cells with reduced toxicity toward non-malignant cells."

    "abstract": "The anticancer activity of 3′-deoxyadenosine (Cordycepin, or dCor) is known to be linked to the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signalling and Hedgehog pathways, as well as the termination of primer elongation by primase in DNA lagging-strand synthesis. In this study, the electronic properties of dCor, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-3′-deoxyadenosine (OXOdCor), and 8-hydroxy-3′deoxyadenosie (HOdCor), together with their spin densities, charge distributions, and global reactive descriptors, have been taken into consideration at the M06-2x/6-31++G** level of theory in the aqueous phase. It was found that dCor predominantly adopts a 3′-endo,anti conformation, while OXOdCor and HOdCor adopt a 2′-endo,syn conformation. Also, the keto form of oxidised dCor was found to be energetically preferred to its enolic form. The adiabatic ionisation potentials (AIPs) were noted as follows (in eV): 6.29 for dCor, 6.21 for OXOdCor, and 6.17 for HOdCor. The lowest adiabatic electron affinity among all the discussed adenine nucleosides analogues was assigned for OXOdCor at 1.12 eV. A thorough analysis of the spin density distribution of the adiabatic radical cation reveals that it has a higher accumulation at N6 > C5 > C8 > 3 of dCor, C5 > N6 > N7 > O8 of OXOdCor, and N6 > C5 > C8 > C2 of HOdCor. The results suggest that Cordycepin is more easily converted to OXOdCor and HOdCor than canonical adenine nucleosides. Much like typical drugs, after its administration and release, Cordycepin is exposed to various physiological factors and can be exposed to ionisation radiation during combined therapy. These factors can influence the therapeutic potential of Cordycepin. Therefore, further studies on its stability are of utmost importance."

    "abstract": "Leukemia is a malignant tumor of the hematopoietic system. Approximately 15% of adult leukemias are chronic myeloid leukemias (CMLs), and this incidence increases annually. The BCR-ABL oncoprotein drives the initiation, promotion, and progression of CML. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first-line therapies for CML, BCR-ABL-mediated drug resistance limits their clinical efficacy and patient prognosis. Perillaldehyde (PAE), a monoterpene and primary volatile oil from perilla, is a promising small-molecule candidate for degrading BCR-ABL and has potential medical applications. The molecular mechanism showed that PAE regulated the expression of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in K562 cells. Confocal laser observation showed that PAE damaged the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced ROS generation. Further evaluations indicated that PAE targeted HSP70 and inactivated the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, thereby inhibiting its downstream proteins. This study may produce a lead compound for CML therapy as PAE may be an effective treatment for further exploration."

This study aimed to assess and enhance a QuEChERS-based extraction method coupled with gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for the quantification of pesticide residues in edible insects (bamboo caterpillars, house crickets, silkworm pupae, giant water bugs, and grasshoppers) by combining multiple individual insect specimens into a single, homogenized sample—five replicates were tested. The method was optimized by evaluating various extraction parameters and showed strong linearity for all 47 target pesticides, with correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.9940 to 0.9999. The limits of detection (LODs) varied between 1 and 10 µg/kg, while the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 10 to 15 µg/kg. Recovery studies conducted at three fortification levels (10, 100, and 500 µg/kg) revealed recoveries ranging from 64.54% to 122.12%, that over 97.87% of the pesticides exhibited satisfactory recoveries within the range of 70–120%, and relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 20%, between 1.86% and 6.02%. Matrix effects (%MEs) range from −33.01% to 24.04%, and to those that experienced no effect. More than 94% of the analytes showed minimal ion suppression or enhancement. These results conform to the SANTE guidelines for monitoring pesticide residues in edible insects, enhancing food safety standards and safeguarding consumer protection."

    "abstract": "AbstractMicroplastics (MPs) have emerged as priority contaminants in aquatic environments in recent years. Growing public concern surrounds their environmental and health impacts, as well as their contribution to future global environmental challenges. As emerging contaminants, key challenges lie in developing efficient methods for their detection, quantification, and removal from aqueous media. Numerous techniques for MP remediation from water have been reported in the literature. Among these, biomass‐derived carbon presents several advantages, including low cost, abundance of raw materials, efficient removal capabilities, and sustainability. This review critically evaluates the potential of biomass‐derived carbon for the removal of MPs from water. It provides a concise overview of MP sources and their environmental pathways. Additionally, it summarizes the synthesis methods and characteristics of biomass‐derived carbon. The review elaborates on the removal performance and underlying mechanisms of MPs by these materials. Key challenges and future research recommendations are also discussed. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, summarizing the current research landscape and outlining strategies for advancing MP remediation using biomass‐derived carbon."

However, central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic. A lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. Here, we silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems."

Since 1975, the intent of this international treaty has been to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. Global commitment to these objectives is reflected by the treaty’s total membership of 188 states. However, member states have thus far been unable to raise strong barriers against illicit bioweapons development. With rapid advancements in science and technology and the rise of biological weapons disinformation, improvements of the Convention are urgently needed. One way to reinforce the treaty is to consider an inspection mechanism that aims to disrupt illicit programs rather than detect them."

However, the identity of antigen-presenting cells (APC) that instruct food-specific pTreg cells is poorly understood. Here, we found that a subset of Thetis cells, TC IV, is required for food-specific pTreg cell differentiation. TC IV were almost exclusively present within mesenteric lymph nodes suggesting that the presence of TC IV underlies the phenomenon of oral tolerance. A wave of TC IV differentiation in the peri-weaning period was associated with a window of opportunity for enhanced pTreg generation in response to food antigens. Our findings indicate that TC IV may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of food-associated allergic and inflammatory diseases."

    "abstract": "Mixing electroactive materials, solid-state electrolytes, and conductive carbon to fabricate composite electrodes is the most practiced but least understood process in all-solid-state batteries, which strongly dictates interfacial stability and charge transport. We report on universal halide segregation at interfaces across various halogen-containing solid-state electrolytes and a family of high-energy chalcogen cathodes enabled by mechanochemical reaction during ultrahigh-speed mixing. Bulk and interface characterizations by multimodal synchrotron x-ray probes and cryo–transmission electron microscopy show that the in situ segregated lithium halide interfacial layers substantially boost effective ion transport and suppress the volume change of bulk chalcogen cathodes. Various all-solid-state lithium-chalcogen cells demonstrate utilization close to 100% and extraordinary cycling stability at commercial-level areal capacities."

    "abstract": "Mountain biodiversity reorganizes rapidly as species shift upslope to track temperatures. Pervasive species redistribution poses substantial threats to mountain ecosystems, a phenomenon sometimes described as an “escalator to extinction,” primarily through mountaintop extinctions, range shift gaps (i.e., rapid shifts of suitable temperatures getting ahead of narrow-range species’ upper limits), and lowland biodiversity attrition, yet empirical evidence remains scarce. In this study, our analysis of 8800 records of historical and modern elevational range limits for 440 animal and 1629 plant species revealed little evidence supporting the proposed threats. Observed changes largely fell within random expectations, accounting for geometric constraints. Although delayed mountaintop extinctions point to accumulating extinction debt, concurrent range expansions of both narrow-range and lowland species suggest thermal niche underfilling, processes that collectively drive biotic homogenization across biologically complex mountain ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Climate affects habitat, food availability, and the movement and sustainability of all life. In this work, we apply Indigenous and Western scientific methods, including genomics and isotope profiling, on fossils from across Beringia to explore the effect of climate change on horses. We find that Late Pleistocene horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times during the last glacial interval. We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth. Our combined Western and Indigenous framework offers critical guidance for wildlife conservation amid ongoing climate change."

    "abstract": "A leading HIV vaccine strategy requires a priming immunogen to induce broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) precursors, followed by a series of heterologous boosters to elicit somatic hypermutation (SHM) and produce bnAbs. In two randomized, open-label phase 1 human clinical trials, IAVI-G002 in the United States and IAVI-G003 in Rwanda and South Africa, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-encoded nanoparticles as priming immunogens (both trials) and first-boosting immunogens (IAVI-G002). The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except 18% of IAVI-G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM, and heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development. The results establish clinical proof of concept that heterologous boosting can advance bnAb-precursor maturation and demonstrate bnAb priming in Africa where the HIV burden is highest."

Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is completely independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations."

    "abstract": "A protective HIV vaccine will need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans, but priming rare bnAb precursor B cells has been challenging. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 human clinical trial, the recombinant, germline-targeting envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer BG505 SOSIP.v4.1-GT1.1, adjuvanted with AS01\n            B\n            , induced bnAb precursors of the VRC01-class at a high frequency in the majority of vaccine recipients. These bnAb precursors, that target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication, consists of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits. Mutations in POLG, which encodes POLγA, lead to various mitochondrial diseases. We investigated the most common POLG mutations (A467T, W748S, G848S, Y955C) by characterizing human and mouse POLγ variants. Our data reveal that these mutations significantly impair POLγ activities, with mouse variants exhibiting milder defects. Cryogenic electron microscopy highlighted structural differences between human and mouse POLγ, particularly in the POLγB subunit, which may explain the higher activity of mouse POLγ and the reduced severity of mutations in mice. We further generated a panel of mouse models mirroring common human POLG mutations, providing crucial insights into the pathogenesis of POLG-related disorders and establishing robust models for therapeutic development. Our findings emphasize the importance of POLγB in modulating the severity of POLG mutations."

Here, we investigate the utility of combining these assays. Specifically, we carry out an MPRA in induced human neurons on over 50,000 sequences derived from fetal neuronal ATAC-seq datasets and enhancers validated in mouse assays. We also test the impact of over 20,000 variants, including synthetic mutations and 167 common variants associated with psychiatric disorders. We find a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity. Four out of five tested variants with significant MPRA effects affected neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos. Mouse assays also reveal pleiotropic variant effects that could not be observed in MPRA. Our work provides a catalog of functional neuronal enhancers and variant effects and highlights the effectiveness of combining MPRAs and mouse transgenic assays."

Here, we develop a lab-on-device system for molybdenum oxide to probe operando hydrogenation mechanisms through in situ electrical and spectral characterization with density functional theory calculations, revealing threshold-driven proton dynamics that govern the transition between nonvolatile memory operation and catalytic hydrogen evolution. Moderate proton intercalation (flux 17 cm-2) achieves a five-order conductance modulation under ambient conditions via polaron formation and stoichiometric optimization (H/Mo up to 22%, Mo/O approaching ideal ratios), outperforming oxygen vacancy engineering. Beyond this threshold (flux ~1017 cm-2), intensive proton intercalation triggers electric-to-chemical energy conversion, directly linking proton history to catalytic activity. Leveraging these principles, we achieve nonvolatile electrochemical memory with linear synaptic and accumulative neuronal functionalities, and demonstrate an all electrochemical random-access memory neural network hardware that executes memory-efficient rank-order coding for sparse signals even under noisy conditions."

Droughts can worsen air quality in regions that rely on hydropower by shifting energy production to combustion power plants. This study quantifies drought-induced excess PM2.5 in Latin America and the Caribbean, where over 443 million people live within 50 km of a combustion power plant. Leveraging a monthly plant-level panel spanning 20 years, we link hydrological droughts, measured as negative runoff anomalies in hydropower watersheds, to changes in PM2.5 concentrations near combustion power plants. Our analysis reveals that these droughts lead to an average increase of 0.83 μg m−3 in PM2.5 levels. Counterfactual simulations for the region reveal that this excess PM2.5 results in up to 10,000 premature deaths annually. Combining our estimates with climate, demographic, and combustion power plant phase-out projections, we demonstrate that this health burden will persist over the next four decades without targeted interventions."

While clinically heterogeneous, converging evidence suggests a shared brain network may underlie tremor across conditions. Here, we empirically define such a network using four modalities: lesion locations, atrophy patterns, EMG-fMRI, and deep brain stimulation outcomes. We show that network connectivity robustly explains clinical outcomes in independent cohorts undergoing deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson’s disease and the ventral intermediate nucleus for essential tremor. Maps from each cohort accounted for outcomes in the respective other, supporting a disorder-independent tremor network. A multimodal agreement map revealed consistent substrates in the primary motor cortex and motor cerebellum. To validate the network, we test its predictive power in a third, independent cohort treated with pallidal stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. Our findings define a robust, cross-condition tremor network that may guide both invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation strategies."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Glioblastoma remains a challenging indication for immunotherapy: the blood-brain barrier hampers accessibility for systemic treatments and the immunosuppressive microenvironment impedes immune attack. Intratumoral therapy with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) can revert immunosuppression but leakage into the circulation causes treatment-limiting toxicity. Here we engineer an IL-12Fc fusion cytokine with reduced binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn. FcRn-silenced IL-12Fc avoids FcRn-mediated brain export, thus exhibits prolonged brain retention and reduced blood levels, which prevents toxicity. In murine glioblastoma, FcRn-silenced IL-12Fc induces more durable responses with negligible systemic cytokine exposure and boosts the efficacy of radio- and chemotherapy. It triggers anti-tumor responses independently of peripheral T cell influx or lymphopenia and leads to inflammatory polarization of the tumor microenvironment in patient-derived glioblastoma explants. FcRn-silencing of IL-12Fc may unlock the full potential of IL-12 for brain cancer therapy and could be further applied to containing the activity of other therapeutics targeting neurological diseases."

Although extensively studied, the structural dynamics of these systems remain elusive. Using ultrafast X-ray scattering, we uncover the photochemistry of Fe(CO)5 in real space and time, observing synchronous oscillations in atomic pair distances, followed by a prompt rotating CO release preferentially in the axial direction. This behavior aligns with simulations, reflecting the interplay between the axial Fe-C distances’ potential energy landscape and non-adiabatic transitions between metal-to-ligand charge-transfer states. Additionally, we characterize a secondary delayed CO release associated with a reduction of Fe-C steady state distances and structural dynamics of the formed Fe(CO)4. Our results quantify energy redistribution across vibration, rotation, and translation degrees of freedom, offering a microscopic view of complex structural dynamics, enhancing our grasp on Fe(CO)5 photodissociation, and advancing our understanding of transition metal catalytic systems."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Terrestrial heatwaves are prolonged hot weather events often resulting in widespread socioeconomic impacts. Predicting heatwaves remains challenging, partly due to limited understanding of the events’ spatial evolution and underlying mechanisms. Heatwaves were mainly examined at fixed stations, with little attention given to the fact that the center of a heatwave can move a long distance. Here, we examine the spatial propagation of terrestrial heatwaves using a complex network algorithm, and find four preferred propagation pathways of terrestrial heatwaves in the northern hemisphere. Along each preferred pathway, heatwaves evolve in two ways: propagating along the pathway or being stationary. We show that the propagating heatwave pathways are consistent with the movement of Rossby wave trains, and that both are guided by enhanced Rossby wave flux activities. The detected propagation pathways are found to provide prior knowledge for occurrences of downstream heatwaves that can be used for identifying associated precursor signals. The results shed light on the mechanisms responsible for preferred propagating heatwave pathways and provide potential predictability of terrestrial heatwaves."

    "abstract": "Transport of elementary excitations is a fundamental property of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, essential for wide-ranging phenomena and device applications. Although exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1 to 2 micrometers, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons enables extended transport lengths and offers opportunities to use photonic mode engineering for tailored transport. Conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons, however, are challenging to tune and integrate into photonic circuits. We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration. We achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in transport length compared to bare excitons and reveal transport dependence on polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which are controlled via photonic crystal design and pump intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These findings establish 2D photonic crystal polaritons as a versatile platform for advancing photonic energy transport technologies."

Engineered living cells can redirect drug delivery systems to effectively reach targeted sites.

GeSNSs act as efficient sonosensitizers, enhancing ultrasound-induced reactive oxygen species generation for treating 4T1 breast tumors. Notably, macrophage hitchhiking delivery of β-elemene–loaded GeSNSs not only achieves high accumulation in tumor regions and suppresses tumor growth under ultrasound treatment, but also effectively remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by improving M1-like macrophage polarization and enhancing the populations of mature dendritic cells, CD4\n            +\n            , and CD8\n            +\n            lymphocytes, thereby facilitating enhanced sonodynamic chemoimmunotherapy.

Enhancing single-photon emission by engineering their photonic environment is essential for improving overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects. Our findings open the door for moiré flatband cavity–enhanced quantum light sources and quantum nodes for the quantum internet."

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that the hippocampus is essential for exploiting predictive relationships during perception. However, it remains unclear whether the hippocampus drives the communication of predictions to sensory cortex or receives prediction signals from elsewhere. We collected 7-tesla fMRI data in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) while auditory cues predicted abstract shapes. Strikingly, neural patterns evoked by predicted shapes in CA2/3, pre/parasubiculum, and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were negatively correlated to patterns evoked by the same shapes when actually presented. Using layer-specific analyses, we ask: In which direction are predictions communicated between the hippocampus and neocortex? Superficial layers of the MTL cortex project to the hippocampus, while the deep layers receive feedback projections. Informational connectivity analyses revealed that communication between CA2/3 and PHC was specific to the deep layers of PHC. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates predictions through pattern completion in CA2/3 and feeds these predictions back to the neocortex."

    "abstract": "Condensation of water vapor in confined geometries, known as capillary condensation, is a fundamental phenomenon with far-reaching implications. While hydrophilic pores enable liquid formation from undersaturated vapor without energy input, the condensate typically remains confined, limiting practical utility. Here, we explore the use of amphiphilic nanoporous polymer-infiltrated nanoparticle films that condense and release liquid water under isothermal and undersaturated conditions. By tuning the polymer fraction and nanoparticle size, we optimize condensation and droplet formation. As vapor pressure increases, voids fill with condensate, which subsequently exudes onto the surface as microscopic droplets. This behavior, enabled by a balance of polymer hydrophobicity and capillarity, reveals how amphiphilic nanostructures can drive accessible water collection. Our findings provide design insights for materials supporting energy-efficient water harvesting and heat management without external input."

    "abstract": "Minimal photon fluxes (MINFLUX) nanoscopy excels in nanoscale protein studies but lacks a universal method for simultaneous imaging and live-cell tracking in dense cellular environments. Here, we developed a general strategy, gradual labeling with fluorogenic probes for MINFLUX (GLF-MINFLUX) imaging and tracking. In GLF-MINFLUX, membrane-permeable small-molecule fluorogenic dye with protein-induced “off/on” switching is gradually labeled, located, and bleached, enabling sequential positioning and tracking of individual proteins. GLF-MINFLUX reveals continuous microtubules with 2.6-nanometer localization precision, offering substantially improved precision (1.7-fold), acquisition (2.2-fold), and target density (3-fold) compared to conventional MINFLUX with Alexa Fluor 647. GLF-MINFLUX also enabled the three-dimensional localization of translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 proteins within mitochondrial clusters and dual-channel nanoscale imaging of endogenous neuronal microtubules and microfilaments. GLF-MINFLUX allowed live-cell single-protein tracking with 7.8-nanometer precision at ~200-microsecond temporal resolution, revealing distinct diffusion behaviors and rates between the basal membrane and filopodia. GLF-MINFLUX, requiring only tuning of probe concentration, offers molecular-level insights into protein functions."

To elucidate the drivers of mantle redox variation, we performed mixed reaction experiments between carbonatite melt and Fe\n            0\n            -bearing peridotite at 9 to 21 gigapascals under varying redox conditions. Comparing our results with sublithospheric diamond inclusions, we find that majorite and ferropericlase inclusions from the Amazonia Craton reflect a predominantly reduced, nonplume mantle environment, while majorites from the Kaapvaal Craton indicate a fully oxidized plume setting. In nonplume environments, carbonatite melts are progressively consumed until fully frozen as reduced carbon. Attachment of these materials to the cratonic keel further enhances craton stability. In plume environments, carbonatite melts surpass the redox buffering capacity of Fe\n            0\n            , leading to an oxidized, CO\n            2\n            -rich melt-bearing mantle.

Multiterminal Josephson junction (MTJJ) has been suggested as a pathway to realize this concept. Yet, the manifestations of topology in MTJJ remain open for experimental study. Here, we investigated the artificial topological band structure of three-terminal graphene Josephson junctions. Using tunneling spectroscopy and magnetic flux gates, we performed a direct mapping of the Andreev bound state (ABS) energy spectrum as a function of two independent phase differences. This ABS spectrum exhibits the transition between gapped states associated with different topological invariants. Our results show the potential of graphene-based MTJJs for engineering band topologies in higher dimensions."

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes acquire essential nutrients primarily through adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) importers, consisting of an adenosine triphosphatase, a permease, and a substrate-binding protein. These importers are highly underrepresented in proteomic databases, limiting our knowledge about their cellular copy numbers, component stoichiometry, and the mechanistic implications of these parameters. We developed a tailored proteomic approach to compile the most comprehensive dataset to date of the\n            Escherichia coli\n            “ABC importome.” Functional assays and analyses of deletion strains revealed mechanistic features linking molecular mechanisms to cellular abundances, colocalization, and component stoichiometries. We observed four to five orders of magnitude variation in import system abundances, with copy numbers tuned to nutrient hierarchies essential for growth. Abundances of substrate-binding proteins are unrelated to their substrate binding affinities but are tightly yet inversely correlated with their interaction affinity with permeases. Counterintuitive component stoichiometries are crucial for function, offering insights into the design principles of multicomponent protein systems, potentially extending beyond ABC importers."

    "abstract": "Chromatin regulation relies on “writer” enzymes that add posttranslational modifications to histone proteins. Variant polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are “writers” of ubiquitylation on histone H2A K118 and K119, crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity."

    "abstract": "Activation of synthetic centromeres on chromosome 4 in maize leads to its breakage and formation of trisomic fragments called neochromosomes. A limitation of neochromosomes is their low and unpredictable transmission rates due to trisomy. Here, we report that selecting for dicentric recombinants through male crosses uncovers stabilized chromosome 4 fission events, which split it into 4a-4b complementary chromosome pairs, where 4a carries a native centromere and 4b carries a synthetic one. The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22."

Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2\n            hi\n            TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance.

Here, we investigate the growth of individual clown anemonefish,\n            Amphiprion percula\n            , during a marine heatwave. We measured the length of 134 wild clown anemonefish every month and monitored temperature at the scale of their anemone for five lunar months. Our results show that clown anemonefish shrink in response to heat stress and individuals that shrink also display relatively more catch-up growth. Further, shrinking is modulated by social rank and size, and individuals that shrink more often and in a coordinated fashion with their breeding partner have higher survival during the heat stress event. In conclusion, a plastic individual growth response to heat stress, constrained by the social environment, can lead to short-term survival benefits. If this plasticity were widespread in fishes, it may have marked consequences for populations and communities as heatwaves become more frequent."

However, the extent to which TCs affect infant survival in LMICs is not well understood. We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries’ children fare better after TC exposure than others."

We present that, thanks to a ground-based observation with optical, radio frequency and high-energy measurements focused on television transmission towers in Kanazawa, Japan, a TGF and a cloud-to-ground discharge of −56 kA occurred when a downward negative leader was colliding with an upward positive leader from the tower. Because the cloud-to-ground current followed the TGF by 30 μs, the TGF started when two leaders approached each other. Our results indicate that an immense number of electrons were produced and accelerated to relativistic energies in a strong and compact electric-field region between the two leaders."

We analyzed data from mice performing a visual go/no-go change-detection task where the sequence of stimulus presentations was intermittently interrupted by omission of a stimulus. The omission of a visual stimulus did not elicit discernable spiking responses in visual cortical neurons. Instead, firing rates between image presentations, including the omission period, ramped linearly and without interruption at the time of the omitted image. Several neuron types in visual cortex neurons were identified with various responses to images and their omissions. A minority of cells in nonvisual areas, including the hippocampus, increased their firing rates at the omitted stimulus onset even when these neurons did not respond to the images. Our study elucidates the origin of omission responses in the visual cortex and sheds light on the role of hippocampal and subcortical circuits in omission detection."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Oxidative addition most commonly involves the addition of a substrate to a metal centre. This reaction is fundamental across synthetic chemistry and underpins numerous catalytic methods. In the textbook description of oxidative addition reactions, a net increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal occurs with simultaneous bond breaking at the substrate. The majority of known oxidative addition reactions, however, involve substrates bearing relatively electronegative elements (for example, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and halogens) and there has been little discussion of how addition processes may fundamentally change if substrates were constructed from more electropositive elements. Here we show that the zinc–zinc bonded complex, Cp*ZnZnCp* (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), which is isoelectronic with dihydrogen, undergoes facile addition to the metal (or semi-metal) centres of a series of main group carbene analogues based on silicon, aluminium, gallium or indium. Reactions proceed with complete breaking of the zinc–zinc bond and an increase in the coordination number of the central metal from two to four. Our analysis suggests that these addition processes are not oxidative, but rather there is likely a continuum of redox outcomes spanning oxidative, redox neutral and reductive. The addition of Cp*ZnZnCp* to silicon(II) provides the most compelling case for a prototypical reductive addition process."

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment remains a critical area of research. In this study, we investigated the potential of molecular hybridization to enhance the anticancer activity of existing molecules with previous demonstrated activity. In this sense, a series of hybrids combining key pharmacophores (melatonin and coumarin) were synthesized for the first time and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic/spectrometric techniques. To verify if this strategy improves biological potential, compounds were evaluated in SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Our results demonstrated that hybrid 3f exhibited activity comparable to conventional chemotherapy with 5‐Fluorouracil (GI50‐3f = 30.12 ± 2.12 µM; GI50‐5FU = 28.83 ± 3.61 µM), suggesting it could be a promising alternative for cancer drug research. Notably, the hybrids 3e and 3f displayed significantly higher inhibition percentages against this cell line regarding parental compounds, even causing total growth inhibition and a certain grade of lethality, highlighting the efficacy of molecular hybridization in potentiating biological effects. In addition, a theoretical examination of pharmacokinetics, toxicological, and drug‐like characteristics indicates that the most promising hybrid, 3f, has a good chance of advancing to additional preclinical studies. Our findings showed that melatonin‐coumarin conjugates are effective, with the 2‐hydroxyphenyl‐substituted conjugate serving as a prototype for further drug investigations addressed to combat colorectal malignant carcinoma (CRC). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential of coumarin/melatonin hybrids against cancer, emphasizing the need for further studies to optimize their activity and explore underlying mechanisms of action."

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this research, a glassy carbon electrode modified with cerium oxide nanoparticles was used to study the electrochemical behavior and determination of caffeine. For this purpose, the surface of the electrode was modified by electrochemical precipitation of cerium oxide at a temperature of 60 °C. The effect of different parameters, such as temperature, electrodeposition potential, pH, buffer type, and concentration of cerium in the preparation of the electrochemical sensor were investigated. Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles were also characterized by different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Increasing the current and minimizing the over potential of caffeine on the glassy carbon electrode modified with cerium oxide nanoparticles are the main advantage of the designed sensor. Under optimal conditions, the oxidation peak currents were proportional to caffeine concentration in the range of 10–368 µM with a low detection limit of 2.9 µM. The modified CeO2/GC electrode has high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and a larger active surface area than a bare glassy carbon electrode and fast response. Finally, the analytical efficiency of the proposed modified electrode was evaluated for the determination of caffeine in some real samples."

In this study, nanoscaled ZnO NPs (denoted as sn‐ZnO NPs) were synthesized under ambient conditions using a biomimetic approach with Sambucus nigra (black elderberry) fruit extract as a natural reducing and capping agent, and zinc acetate dihydrate as the precursor. Morphological, structural, and optical characterizations including FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, and UV–visible spectroscopy confirmed the successful synthesis of hexagonal wurtzite‐structured nanoparticles with an average size of 53 ± 10 nm. The influence of calcination temperatures (500–700 °C) on the structural and optical properties of the nanoparticles was systematically examined. Higher calcination temperatures increased crystallite size and bandgap energy ranging from 1.67 eV (as‐synthesized) to 2.67 eV (700 °C). The nanoparticles demonstrated significant in vitro anticancer activity against SH‐SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with the 600 °C sample exhibiting the highest cytotoxicity achieving an IC50 value of 9.48 µg/mL. These eco‐friendly, biocompatible sn‐ZnO NPs with tunable structural and optical properties demonstrate strong potential for biomedical applications particularly in targeted cancer therapy and lay a foundation for further research into their use in diverse biomedical and environmental fields."

This paper describes effective synthesis and properties of the first nitronyl nitroxide carrying an additional redox‐active phosphine group, namely 1,3,5,7‐tetramethyl‐8‐(4,4,5,5‐tetramethyl‐4,5‐dihydro‐1H‐imidazole‐3‐oxide‐1‐oxyl‐2‐yl)‐2,4,6‐trioxa‐8‐phosphaadamantane. This phosphinonitronyl nitroxide was prepared by reacting lithiated nitronyl nitroxide with 8‐bromo‐1,3,5,7‐tetramethyl‐2,4,6‐trioxa‐8‐phosphaadamantane. The paramagnet was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electron spin resonance (ESR), infrared, and UV/vis spectroscopy supported by quantum chemical calculations. Molecular and crystal structure of the phosphinonitronyl nitroxide was established by X‐ray structural analysis. ESR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved spin delocalization onto the phosphorus atom. According to the cyclic‐voltammetry data, oxidation of the phosphinonitronyl nitroxide takes place quasi‐reversibly at E1/2 = 0.76 V, and its reduction occurs chemically and electrochemically reversibly at E1/2 = −0.95 V (rel.

The structural and morphological characteristics of the synthesized samples were thoroughly investigated. Among them, NiO‐A exhibited superior crystallinity, as confirmed by X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that NaOH concentration significantly influenced the morphology of the nanocrystals. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of Ni in the + 2‐oxidation state in NiO‐A. Electrochemical performance was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge‐discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). NiO‐A demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 165 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, attributed to its large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 462 m2/g, pore volume of 0.49 cc/g, and low charge transfer resistance of 65.13 Ω.

Native biomass and prepared composite were employed to optimize the pH in batch mode, while in continuous mode, parameters like flow rate, bed height, and bisphenol A concentration were optimized, and outcomes were illustrated in breakthrough curves. The maximum biosorption capacity with PH and PPY‐PH is 5.17 and 6.25 mg/g, respectively, at a bed height of 4 cm and a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min. The results exhibited that the maximum biosorption capacity for PH and PPY‐PH was observed at a bed height of 4 cm, a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min, and bisphenol A concentration of 45 ppm. Biosorption feasibility was also studied using mathematical models like the Thomas and Bed Depth Service Time models on experimental data.

Comprehensive characterization techniques, including FT‐IR, XRD, TGA, BET, FESEM, and XPS, confirmed the successful formation and structural features of the composite. The adsorption performance of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 for uranium(VI) removal from aqueous solutions was systematically investigated using batch experiments. The composite exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics and reached equilibrium within 60 min for an initial U(VI) concentration of 25 mg/L at pH 6.0. The adsorption performance of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 demonstrates a superior adsorption capacity of 370.3 mg g‐1, as described by the Langmuir isotherm model, compared to previously reported similar nanomaterials and nanocomposite adsorbents. The enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic interactions between the U(VI) species and the surface functional groups (amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl) of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2. Thermodynamic studies revealed that uranium adsorption on Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 increased with increasing temperature. The composite demonstrated a higher affinity in the presence of competing electrolytes and various metal ions, exhibited excellent regeneration using dilute nitric acid, and maintained its adsorption efficiency over multiple cycles. These results establish Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 as a sustainable and high‐performance adsorbent for U(VI) remediation in real‐world water treatment applications."

XRD analysis revealed monoclinic structure with 18 nm crystallite size. SEM studies confirmed the spherical morphology of produced BJ‐CuO NPs, further supported through TEM analysis (17.67 ± 5.45 nm). Raman spectra showed peaks at 292, 340, and 626 cm−1, which is attributed to Raman active modes for Cu–O stretching (Ag + 2Bg).

The BJ‐CuO NPs had shown significant biological activities with IC50 values in µg/mL, namely, i) antioxidant (72.21), ii) anti‐inflammatory (77.77), and iii) antidiabetic activity (71.36). Further, the cytotoxicity studies on A549 and MCF‐7 cell lines through MTT test reveals moderate effect with IC50 values of 40.68 and 86.62 µg/mL. On screening BJ‐CuO NPs for antibacterial and antifungal activity against various strains, it shows significant activity with E. coli (18 ± 0.30) and A. Niger (18 ± 0.61).

    "abstract": "AbstractStaphylococcus aureus is a prominent Gram‐positive pathogen that poses a global health threat due to its adaptability and increasing resistance to antibiotics. Targeting key bacterial proteins involved in survival and virulence is a promising therapeutic strategy. This study explores riboflavin (VB2) as a potential antimicrobial agent against S. aureus using in silico molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum chemical analyses. Molecular docking identified VB2's strong binding affinity to critical bacterial targets, including dihydrofolate reductase (2W9S) and the ABC transporter (6XJH), with binding affinities of −10.68 kcal/mol and −10.04 kcal/mol, respectively, alongside significant hydrogen bonding. MD simulations confirmed the stability of these complexes, with 2W9S‐VB2 showing an RMSD of 1.6 Å over a 100 ns trajectory, indicating robust interaction stability. Quantum chemical calculations provided additional insights into riboflavin's electronic properties, highlighting its chemical stability and strong interaction potential. These findings suggest that VB2 might serve as an effective inhibitor against S. aureus, paving the way for future experimental validation and optimization to address the growing challenge of antibiotic‐resistant pathogens."

    "abstract": "AbstractSelf‐assembled vesicles of polymer clay nanocomposites (PCN) with functionalized Kaolinite (m‐Kaol) nanoparticles and polystyrene (PS) with stimuli‐sensitive release properties are interesting for chemotherapy. Modifying the vesicle corona by incorporating ionizable groups in the polymer chain can impart defined pH‐sensitivity. In this study, in situ PCN with various compositions of m‐Kaol with styrene and anionic acrylic acid were synthesized and characterized. PCN formed with 60:40 molar ratio of the monomers with m‐Kaol showed self‐assembly in THF into giant vesicles of 1.5–3.0 µm diameter and wall thickness of 50–70 nm, attributed to the functionalization‐induced bilayer assembly of the delaminated, m‐Kaol, Janus nanoparticles by hydrogen bonding involving terminal ─OH groups along the core and stabilized by the π─π interactions of the phenyl moiety along the periphery. Aliphatic rhodamine dye‐encapsulated vesicles showed no release in pH 4.0 indicating the hydrogen bonded carboxyl groups in the corona. Sustained delivery was observed at pH 7.4, attributed to the limited deprotonation leading to diffusion‐controlled release. The vesicles eroded completely at pH 9.0 due to the collapse of the hydrogen bonding. The results showed prospects for applications of these rigid, designer hybrid vesicles which are nontoxic and cost‐effective as pH‐sensitive delivery systems in the gastrointestinal tract or as scaffolds for topical delivery."

    "abstract": "AbstractThe investigation presents a newly synthesized Ag/TiO2@CaSiO3 composite derived from an orange titanium cage. Obtained through a streamlined fabrication process and calcination at variable temperatures, the material underwent distinct structural alterations. Characterization analyses indicated the emergence of a porous architecture, facilitating robust Ag+ ion adsorption. Among the variants studied, materials calcined at 150 °C demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The integration of CaSiO3 into the Ag/TiO2 matrix resulted in the formation of Ag/TiO2@CaSiO3. This composite amalgamates the immediate antibacterial efficacy of Ag+ ions with the enduring antibacterial functionality of Ag/TiO2, additionally augmenting antibacterial performance through reactive oxygen species generation. Owing to its remarkable antibacterial attributes, the Ag/TiO2@CaSiO3 composite is a promising candidate for addressing infection control challenges in medical settings."

    "abstract": "AbstractTuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), continues to be a major global health burden, particularly with the alarming rise of multi‐drug‐resistant (MDR) and extensively drug‐resistant (XDR) strains that compromise the efficacy of conventional therapies. Hence, we designed a new set of spirooxindole‐ and spiroindenoquinoxaline‐derived pyrrolo[3,4‐c] pyrroles that have been synthesized through atom economic one‐pot multicomponent reactions of isatin/indenoquinoxaline and phenylalanine to form an azomethine ylide with maleimide derivatives as dipolarophiles through 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of azomethine ylides. The newly synthesized compounds were structurally characterized using FT‐IR, ¹H, and ¹3C NMR spectroscopy, and their stereochemistry was unambiguously confirmed through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations of selected compounds (4b and 5a) revealed favorable binding interactions with the Mtb enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl‐β‐D‐ribofuranose oxidoreductase, suggesting their potential role in inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. In vitro anti‐tubercular activity was evaluated using the MABA assay against the H37Rv strain, with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol as positive controls. Among the synthesized analogs (4a–4d, 5a–5d), compounds 4d and 5d, bearing a 4‐chloro substituent, showed the most potent activity (12.5 µg/mL), while others exhibited notable inhibitory effects, indicating strong therapeutic potential."

Compounds 7d, 7e, and 7f have shown more powerful efficacy in comparison to the conventional medication erlotinib, according to the activity data. Three strong compounds (7d, 7e, and 7f) were tested on the healthy breast cell line in a cell survival test (MCF‐10A), where they are inactive toward it. Additionally, the compounds 7d, 7e, and 7f were examined for their ability to inhibit tyrosine kinase EGFR. It was shown that compound 7e had a greater inhibitory effect than erlotinib. Additionally, in silico docking experiments exhibited that compounds 7d, 7e, and 7f showed higher EGFR binding contacts. The in silico pharmacokinetic evaluation of the potent compounds 7d, 7e, and 7f was conducted using SWISSADME and pkCSM. Compound 7e adhered strictly to the rules of Veber, Egan, Muegge, Ghose, and Lipinski, whereas compounds 7d and 7f undertook Lipinski, Veber, Egan, and Muegge rules with one deviation."

    "abstract": "AbstractTo achieve efficient electrocatalytic alkaline hydrogen evolution (HER), novel preparation methods for dual‐transition metal nitrides, with dense g‐C3N4/transition metal nitride interface, should be proposed. Herein, a novel g‐C3N4 layer‐coated CoN‐MoN fiber electrocatalyst was prepared on Co foam (CF) via thermopolymerization nitriding strategy. During the fabrication process, CoN‐MoN fiber was prepared facilely on CF, and, meanwhile, a g‐C3N4 layer was successfully coated on CoN‐MoN fiber. The synthesized electrocatalyst (g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF) exhibits a low overpotential of 138 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope (89 mV dec−1) during alkaline HER. The high water splitting capacity could be attributed to the special g‐C3N4 coating structure on the CoN‐MoN fiber. From DFT calculation, an obvious electron transfer occurred at the g‐C3N4/CoN‐MoN interface, which not only improves the hydrolytic dissociation ability but also optimizes its Gibbs free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*). Compared with the ΔGH* of g‐C3N4 and CoN‐MoN/CF, g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF showed a suitable ΔGH* of −2.97 eV, which is relatively close to the ideal ΔGH* (0 eV). Moreover, the H─O─H bond angle of adsorbed water on g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF increased to 105.47°, and the H─O bond was extended to 1.009 Å, which facilitates the breaking of the H─O bond, thus reducing H* to H2."

We observed that effective interaction of NaC in Pluronic P123 at different temperatures (2–25 °C) reduces the overall fluorescence intensity of 1‐NaP. However, the sol to gel transition temperature remains unaffected in presence NaC at low concentration. MCR‐ALS analysed fluorescence spectra of 1‐NaP indicated that the relative contribution of anionic peak increases and neutral peak decreases in presence of NaC in Pluronic P123. This is due to the fact that hydration in the Pluronic P123 microenvironment increases by the charged interfacial region of NaC. Fluorescence life time data suggested that 1‐NaP is distributed mostly in polymer‐water interface and core region of Pluronic P123 experiencing relatively polar microenvironment with restricted diffusive motion."

Cytotoxicity screening revealed six active compounds (11a, 11b, 11c, 11d, 11i, 11j), with 11b (3,4,5‐trimethoxyphenyl) showing the highest potency (IC50: 0.03–0.42 µM). SAR analysis indicated electron‐donating groups enhanced activity. Comparisons with known anticancer drugs validated the efficacy of 11b. Preliminary mechanistic studies, including apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest assays, provided insights into its mode of action. Selectivity assays assessed toxicity against normal cell lines. These findings highlight chalcone‐based oxazole‐oxazolo[4,5‐b]pyridine derivatives as promising anticancer agents.

The current matching condition of Jsc has been determined at the absorber layer thickness of 450 and 790 nm for the top and bottom sub‐cells, respectively. The TSC device parameters such as defect density and doping density have been optimized at 1015 (C2N), 1014 (WS2) cm−3, and 1017cm−3 (C2N and WS2), respectively for achieving better performance of the proposed structure.

Herein, this possibility is investigated by evaluating the reactivity of a simple DQ salt toward amino acids and Cys‐containing peptides in neutral aqueous media. The results show that the DQ salt selectively forms adducts with free Cys and Cys residues in peptides. It is also demonstrated that the DQ salt effectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase, which contains a Cys residue in its active center. These results indicate that the DQ ring could serve as a new reactive group capable of Cys modification for biochemical and pharmaceutical applications."

Understanding these materials is critical to developing conservation strategies, as their composition continues to change with industrial innovation and regulatory changes. This study presents the application of an analytical approach that integrates chemical mapping based on spectroscopic approaches together with analytical pyrolysis, chromatography, and mass spectrometry to investigate two key case studies and provide insights into the evolution of street art materials over the past 30 years. This comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of the composition and transformation of urban art materials over time, overcoming the limitations of individual methods and revealing both organic and inorganic materials. This combined approach represents the state of the art in the study of synthetic paints used in modern art and provides new insights into the evolution of the formulation of materials used by street artists."

At present, the degradation of lead‐based materials due to ion migration phenomenon and the long‐term instability of the prepared devices are still important problems that hinder their practical application. Herein, KI is incorporated into the BA2MA3Pb4I13 polycrystalline detector fabricated via the lamination method. The introduction of KI enhances both the crystallization quality and charge carrier transport capability of the perovskite polycrystalline film. By introducing K+ ions into the interstitial site of perovskite, the effective channel for ion migration is reduced, leading to increased ion activation energy, and then the ion migration in perovskite is effectively inhibited. Consequently, the prepared X‐ray detector exhibits improved stability, with a sensitivity of 6250 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 19.7 nGyair s−1. This study broadens the idea of enhancing the stability of perovskite and lays a research foundation for its practical application."

The cords, along with cords from four other royal documents of the same period, show considerable deterioration due to age and material components. The analysis employed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS) and high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC‐UV‐Vis‐ESI MS/MS) to examine the inorganic mordants and organic dyes. The results revealed ellagitannin dyes in the black cords and lac and madder dye markers in one red cord. Some soluble redwoods (likely pernambuco, also known as brazilwood) were detected in the others, either on their own or mixed with weld. The preservation state varied among cords, correlating with the mordants; iron predominated in the black and red threads of Łaski’s Statute, contributing to their degradation, whereas the white cord exhibited higher sulfur content. In‐situ sampling using papers soaked with bathophenanthroline (Bphen) allowed detection of major elements in the fibers. These findings are vital for guiding future conservation practices and mitigating risks in cleaning and restoring these delicate materials."

It is known that in the past, the pigment is collected in wooden reservoirs in which copper (Cu) compounds precipitated from drainage water during copper mining at Špania Dolina–Piesky and Ľubietová deposits, Slovakia. Microsamples of four polychrome wooden sculptures from the 16th‐17th centuries are examined. Posnjakite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·H2O) and malachite (Cu2(CO3)(OH)2) are most frequently detected by X‐ray powder microdiffraction. In rock samples from the mine site, brochantite (Cu4SO4(OH)6) and malachite are dominant, and in recent precipitates, only langite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·2H2O) is detected, remained in contact with leaking water. In the laboratory, the pigment is prepared by gradually enriching the starting CuSO4·5H2O solution with NaHCO3 in two series of experiments. The initial concentration of the reactants reflected the ratio of Cu2+: HCO3− = 1:1 found in the mine waters at the site, from which langite crystallizes. However, langite does not formed, while brochantite gradually transformed into posnjakite and subsequently malachite. The co‐occurrence of basic copper sulfates and carbonates and the characteristic grain morphology proved to be the main indicators of the pigment in artworks."

It enhances NF stability by utilizing CNSs synthesized from eight biowaste sources, each exhibiting varying dispersion capabilities (zeta potential, ZP values) ranging from ‐17 mV to ‐45.6 mV. For the first time, this research investigates how the ZP of biomass‐derived CNSs influences the TC and dynamic viscosity (V) of biomass‐based NFs. The NFs demonstrated high stability without the need for surfactants, achieving up to 111.8% enhancement in TC with high stability up to 40 days.  The influence of CNS concentration (0.01‐ 0,1 wt%) on TC was studied, revealing optimal enhancement at 0.1 wt%. The effect of ZP on thermal diffusivity is also studied. This work bridges the gap between research and industry, offering significant potential in the automotive sector. It provides a practical guide for future researchers to enhance their understanding of high‐efficiency coolants. Furthermore, this study aligns with seven Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing a cost‐effective waste‐to‐wealth approach that promotes sustainability and innovation."

    "abstract": "Increasing biodiesel production poses a significant challenge in managing its primary byproduct, bioglycerol. Advancements in production techniques have markedly enhanced bioglycerol potential applications across various sectors, including as cosolvent in industrial formulations. In the context of eco‐sustainable formulation design, this study addresses the self‐aggregation of rhamnolipids, biosurfactants with a wide range of physico‐chemical and biological activities, in bioglycerol aqueous mixtures, studied by integrating surface tension and NMR self‐diffusion measurements. Preliminary analysis of the properties of water‐bioglycerol mixtures indicates that bioglycerol impurities (mainly potassium acetate) have only a small effect on surface tension and no discernible effect on bulk properties such as density, viscosity and refractive index. The aggregation of rhamnolipids is unaffected by bioglycerol at concentrations up to 40‐50 wt%. At higher cosolvent levels, the cmc increases and the micelle dimension micellar size decreases, an indirect effect of the decreasing polarity of the medium. These results provide the basic knowledge to promote the exploration of rhamnolipids and bioglycerol as valuable ingredients in formulations for various applications."

    "abstract": "Herein, the pH‐dependent self‐assembly behavior of a thiazole‐modified peptide nucleic acid (PNA) Thz‐3 in the presence of silver ions (Ag+) is investigated. Using a combination of spectroscopy, microscopic imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations, the formation of entangled networks of long, interlinked linear structures of Thz‐3 at pH 5.5 induced by Ag+ ions, is observed. This self‐assembly is driven by intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions and further stabilized by cation–π interactions between Ag+ and thiazole rings. Molecular clusters comprising two to four Thz‐3 molecules are formed, which then organize into chain‐like networks through noncovalent H‐bonding and van der Waals interactions. These findings shed light on the development of selective and pH‐responsive nanomaterials derived from modified peptides and PNAs."

    "abstract": "This study uses a membrane‐less reactor to explore the bioelectrochemical remediation of real contaminated groundwater from chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) and nitrates. The research focuses on testing a column‐type bioelectrochemical reactor to stimulate in‐situ degradation of contaminants through the supply of electrons by a graphite granules biocathode. After a preliminary laboratory characterization and operation with a synthetic feeding solution, a field test was conducted in a real contaminated site, where the reactor demonstrated effective degradation of CAHs and inorganic anions. Notably, the cathodic potential promoted the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated species. Simultaneously, nitrate reduction, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis occurred, influencing the overall coulombic efficiency of the process. The use of real groundwater, compared to the synthetic medium, significantly decreased the coulombic efficiency of reductive dechlorination, dropping from 2.43% to 0.01%. Concentration profiles along the bioelectrochemical reactor allowed for a deeper description of the reductive dechlorination rate at different flow rates as well as increased knowledge about reduction and oxidation mechanisms. Scaling up the technology presents several challenges, including the optimization of coulombic efficiency and the management of competing microbial metabolisms. The study provides a valuable contribution towards advancing bioelectrochemical technologies for bioremediation of complex contaminated sites."

This study reports the design and synthesis of dopant‐free pyrazine‐based HTMs. PS1 features a D–A–D type structure with pyrazine as the acceptor and 4,4′‐dimethoxy triphenylamine (4,4′‐OMe‐TPA) as the donor, while PS2 adopts a D–π–A–π–D configuration with an additional thiophene unit as π‐spacer along with 4,4′‐OMe‐TPA as donor. Both compounds are synthesized through a simple two‐step synthetic procedure. These HTMs are subjected to structural, photophysical, electrochemical, theoretical, and photoelectrochemical studies with an emphasis on evaluation of structure–property relationships. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the electronic distribution, optimized molecular structure, and frontier molecular orbitals. Their performance in PVSCs is systematically evaluated without adding dopants. PS2 exhibits superior photoluminescence quenching compared to PS1, indicating more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite layer. Notably, PS2 achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%, surpassing the performance of PS1 (PCE of 10.15%). These findings highlight the potential of adjusting the electron‐deficient core and π‐bridge units as an effective strategy to optimize the properties of HTMs and improve their performance in PVSC applications."

    "abstract": "The development of environmentally friendly oxidants has emerged as a prominent topic in the fields of green chemistry and chemical engineering. This review comprehensively examines the sustainable production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and its applications in green chemical synthesis. H2O2, known as a green oxidant, is generated through the 2e− ORR pathway using various catalysts, including noble metals, carbon‐based materials, single‐atom catalysts, and transition metal oxides. This method offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional H2O2 production, enabling in‐situ synthesis without organic waste. The review highlights the direct role of H2O2 in promoting chemical transformations, such as the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides and alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Additionally, it explores the indirect application of H2O2 through its decomposition into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in Fenton reactions, which drive selective oxidation and degradation processes. These applications demonstrate the versatility of H2O2 in advancing green chemistry by facilitating eco‐friendly oxidation reactions and pollutant degradation. Future work will focus on improving catalyst stability and scalability for industrial use, further enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of H2O2‐based chemical processes."

This research focuses on murals from the churches of Marcapata and Canincunca in the Cuzco region. Microsamples from these murals were analyzed using micro‐invasive techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy‐dispersive spectroscopy (SEM‐EDS), and Raman microspectroscopy. The study revealed a preparation layer of gypsum/anhydrite on adobe walls and a simple yet diverse palette of pigments. Red pigments included hematite (Fe₂O₃) and organic carmine dye, while green hues featured copper‐based pigments such as antlerite (Cu₃SO₄(OH)₃) and posnjakite (Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆·H₂O), identified here for the first time as a major component in Andean mural paintings. Blue tones were achieved using indigo and smalt, a cobalt‐containing glass pigment whose presence is still scarcely documented in Peruvian murals. These findings deepen our understanding of colonial pigment selection, preparation practices, and their deterioration mechanisms, contributing to sustainable conservation strategies. This study highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing knowledge of Hispanic‐American colonial art and its preservation as a vital component of cultural heritage."

    "abstract": "This work studies the kinetics of platinum leaching using HClO4 and H2O2. The experiments were carried out by dissolving small pieces of high‐purity platinum with an irregular shape. The knowledge obtained can be useful for leaching minerals with disseminated native platinum in refractory minerals such as silicates of which there are large quantities in nature but are not processed due to their great refractoriness. The results show that increasing the temperature and the HClO4 concentration increases the leaching rate. Interestingly, for each HClO4 concentration, an H2O2/HClO4 = 2.5 ratio exists that optimises the leaching kinetics. The best operating conditions were approximately 70 °C, [HClO4] 3M, and [H2O2] 7.2 M. From kinetic analysis, it was concluded that the leaching process is governed by a mixed control stage (diffusion in the boundary layer and surface chemical reaction). Also, it was proposed that the leaching process mechanism is supported by fundamental thermodynamic and experimental results, highlighting the importance of chlorine gas for this novel extraction method that reaches elevated recoveries. This process is also interesting because the chemical system can potentially weaken the crystallographic structure of silicates (very important), increasing the feasibility of extracting the partially not liberated precious metals."

    "abstract": "Gold (Au) exhibits distinct reactivities with O2 at the nanometer to atomic scales, whereas bulk Au is chemically inert. Since the discovery of catalytic reactivities in Au‐based materials, including nanoparticles, molecular complexes, and nanoclusters (AuNCs), mechanistic insights into the interaction and reductive activation of O2 by Au have been pursued by researchers. However, the atomic level understanding of the reaction mechanism remains elusive compared with that for other widely explored transition metalO2 systems. This paper briefly discusses recent progress in clarifying the reaction mechanisms of Au‐O2 chemistry for homogeneous molecular Au complexes and atomically precise AuNCs. We introduce our research on (1) O2‐activation by Au complexes without the distinct formation of conventional metal‐hydride species, and (2) the application of kinetic analyses to the reaction of thiolate‐protected AuNCs with O2 to quantify parameters like O2‐binding constants on the Au surface. These findings help elucidate both the Au‐O2 interaction and reductive activation of O2, which are essential in catalytic systems using O2 as a terminal oxidant that can contribute to the developments of eco‐friendly oxidation Au‐based catalysts with high performance."

The light‐response properties of NTO‐CN heterostructure were significantly broadened in the visible spectrum. The elemental composition, binding energy, oxidation states of the constituent elements and surface adsorption of the synthesized materials were characterized. The percentage of degradation of RhB dye employing NTO‐CN heterostructure photocatalyst was computed to be 92.3%. This value was 1.66 times and 1.49 times greater than NaTaO3 and g‐C3N4 respectively. Pseudo first order rate constant value for NTO‐CN heterostructure photocatalyst was calculated to be 0.0288 min‐1. This value was 3.43 times and 2.82 times greater than NaTaO3 and g‐C3N4 respectively.

Herein, first, the terpolymerization of CO2, propylene oxide (PO), and epichlorohydrin (ECH) to synthesize PPC‐ECH terpolymers via one‐pot and metal‐free method using multinuclear organoboron catalysts is reported. The PPC‐ECH terpolymers with well‐rounded properties can be easily synthesized by adjusting reaction conditions, monomer ratios, catalyst types, and loading. The molecular weight of the PPC‐ECH terpolymer can reach up to 59.4 kg mol−1, which is the highest known. Notably, the synthesized PPC‐ECH exhibits outstanding barrier performance with oxygen permeability as low as 1.31 cm3 mm (m2 day)−1 and water vapor permeability as low as 0.016 g mm (m2 day)−1, significantly lower than those of pure PPC or other common packaging materials. Importantly, the introduction of a small amount of ECH not only preserves the biodegradability of polycarbonate but also markedly enhances its mechanical properties, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and flame retardancy, offering promising prospects for application in packaging materials."

Interestingly, when Ag4 complex 2 was added to Au4 complex 3 at room temperature, Ag2Au2 complex 4 formed immediately and in quantitative yield.

This recombinant strain (B3805V) is able to transform 5 g L−1 phytosterols to 2.0 g L−1 4‐HBC without detectable AD by‐product. Additionally, by disrupting the ltp2 and car genes, a strain (strain B3805VI) is obtained to transform phytosterols to PDCE with 1.44 g L−1 titer.

    "abstract": "A sensitizer is a vital component of dye‐sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); it absorbs incident photons, excites electrons, and facilitates charge transfer to the semiconductor. In the present work, modification of betalain dyes through grafting of electron donor groups has been performed. The reported optoelectronic properties of the investigated dyes are determined using density functional theory (DFT) and time‐dependent DFT methods. The investigated sensitizers exhibit maximum absorption between 400 and 442 nm with light‐harvesting efficiencies exceeding 93%. Favorable interactions are observed between the dyes and the hydrogenated TiO2 cluster, (TiO2)6H3. The obtained binding energies range from −1.39 to −0.97 eV in the gas phase and −0.31 to −0.03 eV in water. The electronic spectra of the dye@TiO2 complexes show broader and intensive bands with bathochromic shifts when compared to the individual dyes. The charge density distribution in the complexes indicates appropriate ability of the dyes for charge injection to the semiconductor. Among the considered dyes, the most promising candidates for use in DSSCs have been selected."

Different classes of metabolites, including phenolic acids, phenylethanoids, flavonoids, iridoids, organic acids, terpenes, and fatty acids, are identified in the three species, with methanol as the best solvent to recover bioactive compounds from the three species in addition to ethyl acetate for P. kurdica. Around 70% methanol extract of P. herba‐venti exerts the best radical scavenging and ions‐reducing properties, while its methanol extract exhibits the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. The ethyl acetate extract of P. fruticosa displays the best chelating power, and its other polar extracts have the highest total antioxidant activity. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations have underscored the therapeutic potential of bioactive compounds, including isoverbascoside, samioside, forsythoside B, and hattushoside. In conclusion, the study indicates that these three Phlomis species are a rich source of bioactive molecules with possible therapeutic applications, and the selection of appropriate extraction solvents is crucial for the targeted biological activity."

This study aims to evaluate the interfacial and thermodynamic properties of five widely used petroleum surfactants to better understand their efficiency under mild reservoir‐like conditions. IFT is measured using the spinning drop tensiometer across a temperature range of 25–40 °C, while critical micelle concentrations (CMC) are determined via conductometric methods. Thermodynamic parameters of micellization are calculated from temperature‐dependent CMC data. The results show that micellization is an entropy‐driven process for all tested surfactants. The studied surfactants significantly reduce IFT values within the tested temperature range, underscoring their potential for practical application in EOR formulations. The study also confirms that accurate determination of CMC is essential in optimizing surfactant efficiency under varying environmental conditions."

The limits of detection (LODs) for Cu2+, Hg2+, and Ag+ are determined to be 299, 522 nM, and 1.58 μM, respectively. Interestingly, the probes also show “turn‐on” fluorescence upon the addition of glutathione (GSH) in the presence of Cu2+ or Hg2+. Specifically, the LOD for GSH using the BPh‐TPE‐Cu2+ complex is 457 nM. Practical applicability is confirmed via visual color changes on filter paper and in water samples. These findings highlight the potential of these TPE derivatives for detecting copper, mercury, silver ions, and GSH in environmental water. Additionally, Al/organic layer/p‐Si heterojunction devices incorporating spin‐coated TPE layers are fabricated. Their electrical behaviors are analyzed through current‐voltage and current‐time measurements under varying light conditions.

It is well known that various microorganisms synthesize and store high‐molecular‐weight polyhydroxyalkanoates in their cytoplasm as water‐insoluble inclusions. In this study, the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii N‐15 strain is used for bioplastic production. The optimal polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) yield (62% of biomass, 23.6 g L−1 dry cells) is achieved by cultivating the bacteria in Burke's medium with molasses as a carbon source (5 wt.%) at 30 °C, 220 rpm, for 50 h. The resulting polymer was characterized using thin‐layer chromatography, UV‐Vis, fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and X‐ray diffraction. The results confirmed that the polymer is PHB with a purity of 98.9%, a molecular weight of 1.2 MDa, a crystallinity of 73%, a melting point of 179 °C, a decomposition temperature of 275 °C, a density of 1.22 g cm−3, a melt flow index of 10 g 10 min−1, a Shore hardness of 82, a tensile strength of 30 MPa, and a relative elongation at break of 4.5%.

    "abstract": "Perchlorate ions (ClO4−) are prevalent contaminants in the surface, and drinking water that disrupt thyroid function by competitively inhibiting the sodium‐iodide symporter (NIS), posing significant health risks. Here, fluorescence‐based logic gates have been constructed by leveraging the binding interactions between a hemicyanine dye, 4‐[4‐(dimethylamino)‐styryl]‐1‐docosylpyridinium bromide (DASPC22) and β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) that could be useful to know whether ClO4− ions in water are within the toxicity range or not. In aqueous media, DASPC22 forms nonfluorescent H‐aggregates, but fluorescence is enhanced upon forming host‐guest inclusion complexes with β‐CD. At low ClO4− ions concentrations, fluorescence intensity further increases due to enhanced complex stability through hydrogen bonding. ONIOM‐based quantum chemical calculations have supported this phenomenon. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of DASPC22 in the presence of β‐CD and a low concentration of ClO4− ions leads to the construction of a YES logic gate that would enable one to quantify ClO4− ions’ toxicity range in water. Dual‐input‐single‐output AND and INHIBIT logic gates with low and high concentrations of ClO4− ions, respectively, have also been constructed. The present system could be useful in addressing safety concerns related to perchlorate contamination of water."

Chromatography and magnetic resonance assessed the purity, identity, and structural features of the synthesized compounds, ensuring their suitability for the said applications. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction was exploited for structure solution of three of them, revealing that the introduction of specific substituents induces changes in both the molecular structure and the crystal packing, driven by a balance between π‐stacking and weak nonbonding contacts. Small changes in the pyridine substituents can induce conformational changes in the opposite benzyl ring orientation, spanning from a planar to a perpendicular orientation.

In this work, Chlorine‐coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl‐FePc) has been studied as a catalyst for the electrochemical ORR. Coordination of iron phthalocyanine with chlorine introduces additional active sites for ORR, improving its catalytic activity. The chlorine atoms enhance the electron transfer process and facilitate the ORR validated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The obtained catalyst exhibits fast kinetics for O2 adsorption and activation with an ultralow Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 and a remarkable half‐wave potential of 0.80 V.

In this article, we report the synthesis of a series of azomethine‐pyrazole derivatives bearing a para‐substituted azo‐phenyl ring. These compounds were evaluated as antifungal agents against Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans strains. Compound ClAzoNH, substituted by chloride, displayed the highest toxicity on Candida albicans, with an MIC50 value of 2.08 μg/mL, while methoxy‐substituted MeOAzoNH showed moderate inhibitory activity. The unsubstituted AzoNH compound exhibited the highest activity towards Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei strains. In the case of C. albicans, the CaCYP51 protein appears to be the most probable biological target, while for C. neoformans, interactions with the CnFTase protein explained the in vitro results."

Five NCF/G battery electrode compositions with increasing NCF content (40–70 wt%) are fabricated via a straightforward aqueous route and are evaluated in Li+ half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li+ and NCF surface groups suggesting Li+ diffusion through nanochannels. A perspective on the material‐driven reshaping of flexible NCF/G battery electrodes is provided, by investigating the contribution of NCF to charge storage mechanisms and to mechanical resilience. This study contributes to the development of battery electrodes that can be tailored to energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics applications, and towards battery market diversification."

    "abstract": "The electroreduction of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers promising opportunities for the synthesis of valuable chemical precursors. However, achieving high selectivity in this process remains challenging due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved. Here, this study employs different electrochemical techniques to analyze each of the HMF electroreduction pathways. These findings demonstrate that the primary products of HMF electroreduction are 2,5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 5‐methylfurfural alcohol (MFA), with lower formation of 5‐methylfurfural (5‐MF) and 2,5‐dimethylfuran. This study identifies a significant competition between hydrogen evolution reaction and the reduction of HMF and 5‐MF that affect the faradaic efficiencies of the organic transformation. In contrast, BHMF and MFA display a reduced reactivity, behaving as terminal molecules. Through impedance analysis, it is possible to follow the reaction pathways by associating each reaction step with the changes observed in charge transfer and accumulation phenomena. These are key parameters for understanding the reaction mechanisms in the system as they allow to distinguish between adsorption, absorption and reaction of the organic molecules onto the electrode surface. This approach helps to accurately select the optimal potential for the reduction reactions. The results obtained in this study facilitate the design of efficient and selective electrocatalytic systems for biomass conversion."

In liquid electrolytes, h‐BN improves ionic mobility and suppresses side reactions, while in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), it enhances mechanical flexibility and thermal stability. SSEs benefit from h‐BN's ability to suppress dendrites, reinforce mechanical strength, and optimize interfacial compatibility, making it a key enabler for next‐generation battery technologies. Despite its promise, challenges such as dispersion uniformity, cost, and interfacial complexity must be addressed. Future directions, including the development of multifunctional architectures, dynamic electrolytes, and sustainable synthesis methods, are discussed to guide the integration of h‐BN in emerging energy storage systems. This perspective article explores the multifunctional roles of h‐BN, highlighting its contributions to enhancing ionic transport, thermal management, and interfacial stability.

    "abstract": "Cyclic azobenzenes generally exhibit enhanced photophysical properties compared to conventional linear azobenzenes, such as visible‐light activation and exceptional thermal stability. However, their broader application has been hindered by synthetic challenges. Herein, the electrochemical synthesis of a ten‐membered cyclic azobenzene, 6,7‐dihydrodibenzo[e,i][1,4,7,8]dioxadiazecine (DDEI), is reported through the reduction of 1,2‐bis(2‐nitrophenoxy)ethane (BNPOE) in the presence of CO2. The reduction mechanism, involving an irreversible eight‐electron process and CO2 capture, is elucidated using in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) spectroelectrochemistry, complemented by 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry analyzes. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that DDEI undergoes highly efficient trans‐to‐cis isomerization under green light (500 nm) irradiation, achieving a remarkable yield of 97%, with both isomers exhibiting excellent thermal stability. In contrast to 8‐ and 9‐membered cyclic azobenzenes and in line with conventional linear azobenzenes, the trans configuration of DDEI is more stable than the cis configuration. This combination of synthetic accessibility and superior photophysical properties makes DDEI a promising candidate for various applications, including those in living systems."

    "abstract": "Catalyst dissolution is one of the key challenges in achieving long‐term performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with low iridium loading. However, most of the dissolved catalyst remains in the catalyst‐coated membrane, inaccessible for operando quantification. While simpler aqueous model systems improve mechanistic understanding, dissolution rates are significantly overestimated compared to the device level. To bridge this gap, herein, an electrochemical half‐cell setup that mimics the anode catalyst layer environment to enable operation at relevant current densities (>1 ) is presented. Dissolved catalyst species transported through the porous transport layer or through the membrane are separately detected operando by coupling to inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate a strong preference for the transport of dissolved iridium through the membrane (99.9%) and a decrease in catalyst stability by factor 10 at high current densities. Discrepancies with so far reported findings from full‐cell and half‐cell experiments highlight a lack of understanding of catalyst dissolution and the transportation of dissolved species in different systems. The presented method offers unique insights which will help to study and optimize catalyst dissolution by means of various manufacturing and operation parameters to ultimately improve the stability of catalyst layers for water electrolysis."

    "abstract": "Recent reports show [FeFe] hydrogenase mimics are active for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate (HCOO−). Herein, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with the [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic [Fe2(μ‐pdt)(CO)6, 1, where pdt = propane‐1,3‐dithiolate] in acetonitrile is reported. In the presence of the weak acid, methanol (MeOH), 1 reduces CO2 to both CO (Faradaic Efficiency maximum [FEmax] of 16 ± 6%) and HCOO− (FEmax = 20%) and produces H2 (FEmax = 56 ± 4%). Without added MeOH, 1 reacts with adventitious water to form H2 (FEmax = 85 ± 1%), HCOO− (FEmax = 7.8%), and CO (FEmax = 7 ± 3%) with CO32− being detected by infrared spectroscopy.  Product formation is potential dependent: more negative potentials increases selectivity for HCOO− over CO. The first reduction of 1 forms a pdt‐bridged dimer, 2. However, the reduction of 2 at the potentials required for electrochemical CO2 reduction leads to two new species. Using density functional theory, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR‐SEC), these structures are identified to be [Fe(CO)4]2− (3) and a trinuclear Fe3 species (4). While these species can reduce CO2 to CO and HCOO−, the predominant formation of H2 reveals kinetic issues in  CO2 reduction. The work offers to consider alternate competing mechanistic pathways and explains the lack of product selectivity when using hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO−."

The PBSCF‐Ir composite exhibits a low overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and stability over 300 h. In water splitting tests, it achieves a lower cell voltage (1.95 V at 500 mA cm−2) compared to pure IrO2. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a 1 eV blueshift in Co 2p energy levels, indicating modified electronic structures. Density functional theory calculations show that IrO2 shifts the d‐band centers of Co and Fe, enhancing electrophilicity, OH− affinity, and OER activity.

    "abstract": "The strong binding energy of CO on iron surfaces has rendered Fe electrodes as poor electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) catalysts, predominantly producing hydrogen. Recent studies on tuning the microenvironment near the catalyst surfaces by tuning the local electric field in nonaqueous environments have been shown to promote eCO2R by facilitating the CO2 activation step. Herein, the use of tetraethylammonium (TEA) cation to tune the electric field on Fe surfaces, such that it leads to the formation of industrially relevant oxalates (C2 products), is reported. At optimal cation concentrations, the developed eCO2R system achieves 25 mA cm−2 of current density and Faradaic Efficiencies up to 75% toward oxalate. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of surface‐adsorbed TEA cations and other species on the Fe surfaces, leading to the well‐known outer‐sphere mechanism of electron transfer during eCO2R. The employment of Fe, along with microenvironment tuning, not only demonstrates high catalytic performance but also provides a safer and more sustainable alternative to toxic catalysts such as Pb that dominate the nonaqueous eCO2R literature. These findings pave the way for further optimization and scale‐up of the process, offering a viable route for sustainable chemical production and CO2 mitigation."

Fuel cells are recognized for their ability to generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen, with water as the only byproduct, and can also function in reverse as energy storage systems by producing hydrogen. Batteries chemically store energy and enable zero‐carbon emissions through their closed‐loop functionality.

Furthermore, EIS can serve as an in situ analysis method during operation, making it even more impactful in the near future. This article reviews the studies and applications of EIS, an advanced technique that provides insights into the electrochemical reaction at the interfaces and charge transfer processes within these systems. In addition, it provides an overview of the electrochemical principles governing these technologies, with a focus on the distinct roles and mechanisms of their components.

First, the electrochemical deposition potentials are altered in equivalent electrolyte conditions, which is found to alter the size of the deposited nanomaterials and the corresponding electrode surface roughness. Second, the electrodes are soaked in thiol‐containing solutions containing a range of both aromatic and aliphatic thiols to achieve chemically modified self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the electrode surfaces. The surface and morphological properties of the electrodeposited electrodes are assessed with scanning electron microscopy, laser confocal, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Confocal and AFM also allow the determination of the surface roughness of the electrodes at both the microscale and the nanoscale. The presence of SAM‐modification is determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angles are also measured on the nonthiol‐modified and thiol‐modified electrodes, and the contact angle is found to increase from 70°–100° to 130°–140°, close to superhydrophobic levels of contact angles."

Herein, a propylene carbonate (PC)‐based electrolyte system is reported, employing hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as synergistic additives. Specifically, HFB facilitates compatibility with graphite anodes through selective interfacial adsorption, while the decomposition of FEC stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), mitigating the formation of high‐impedance interfaces. This tailored electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity, excellent oxidative stability, and broad temperature tolerance. When validated at 4.5 V, high‐loading NCM811/graphite cells achieve nearly full capacity over 100 cycles at low temperatures (−20 °C), with pouch cells retaining 80% of their capacity after 470 cycles.

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with their unique structural tunability, redox properties, and high surface area have emerged as promising candidates for the OER process. In this work, a presentation on how linker functionalization in rather unexplored manganese‐based MOFs leads to enhanced OER activity is given. A series of manganese‐based MOFs in rarely reported MIL‐88B structure (Mn‐MIL‐88‐X) is synthesized using functionalized linkers [X = NH2, NO2, Br]. The objective is to modulate the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of the MOFs leading to enhanced OER activity. Among functionalized MOFs, Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 shows remarkable performance, requiring only 260 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1. The improvement in OER activity of Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 is ascribed to the higher oxidation states of manganese (Mn3+/Mn4+) and the presence of the amino group (‐NH2) as confirmed through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

    "abstract": "The activation of CO2 is essential for efficient electrochemical conversion, yet its weak physisorption on pristine Cu surfaces severely hinders catalytic performance. To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the OCO angles and elongate the CO bonds, transforming CO2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual‐V and dual‐Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO2, leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu‐based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO2 utilization."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the impact of alternant phenyl substituents on the photophysical properties of tris‐(2,4,6‐trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM)‐type radicals. Most donor–acceptor‐type luminescent systems show solvent‐polarity sensitivity, which limits their applications. Herein, three alternate π‐conjugated biphenyl/terphenyl substituents are attached to the TTM unit. Results reveal that connection modes and types of benzene ring derivatives lead to distinct charge transfer (CT) and locally excited state hybrid emitters due to the differences in conjugation degree. All three radicals exhibit polarity‐insensitive red emission (626–690 nm), and their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) increase with solvent polarity. Specifically, linear‐conjugated TTM‐DPh has higher photostability but lower PLQY, while nonlinear‐conjugated TTM‐3DPh and TTM‐TPh have nearly 10‐fold higher PLQYs. The photophysical studies suggest that the conjugation degree and hybridization level between CT and ground states account for these properties."

Herein, the successful synthesis of ≈2.6 nm AuPt alloy nanoparticles supported on MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures via in situ transformation of α‐MnO2 is reported. Selective aerobic photocatalytic glycerol oxidation toward value‐added C3 products has been achieved with AM 1.5G light irradiation under ambient conditions on these as synthesized 1 wt% AuPt/MnO2‐Mn3O4, which displays 2.3 and 6.5 times enhancement compared to that of AuPt/Mn3O4 and AuPt/MnO2. A 74% overall C3 product selectivity (60% in terms of glyceric acid) has been achieved at 75% glycerol conversion after 4 h of photocatalytic reaction. Investigation results reveal that the formation of MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures combines the local photothermal heating (primarily on MnO2) synergistically with the photochemical catalysis (on Mn3O4), thus achieving enhanced photocatalytic glycerol oxidation. This study may provide guidance for future catalyst design, where photon‐driven photocatalysis with phonon‐driven photothermal effect can be seamlessly integrated to achieve maximal solar energy utilization and high photocatalytic efficiency."

    "abstract": "Photochemistry has revolutionized the chemical industry by introducing sustainable and energy‐efficient processes that are vital for the manufacture of advanced materials which align with Industry 4.0 standards. Among photochemical techniques, photopolymerization stands out as a rapid, controlled, and eco‐friendly approach, making it particularly suitable for applications like 3D printing. This research in two‐photon‐induced photopolymerization for 3D microfabrication led to groundbreaking performance, thanks to the use of custom π‐extended molecular architectures as photoinitiators. Building on these results, a photoactivable initiation system for photoinduced‐atom transfer radical polymerization (photoATRP) is now reported using a similar π‐extended photoinitiator. Through comprehensive optimization, we successfully created a functional multicomponent photoinitiating system, with its detailed mechanism thoroughly established in solution. By covalently attaching alkyl halides to glass surfaces, we were able to implement the surface‐induced photo‐ATRP technique to create customized brush polymer architectures. This work not only advances the understanding of photoATRP mechanisms but also introduces new strategies for functional surface engineering, with potential applications in two‐photon‐induced surface modification of 3D/4D structures via photoATRP."

The energy transfer mechanism between sensitized ions and activated ions is discussed with the help of fluorescence spectra and decay curve in details. Notably, different from other phosphors based on this host material, these prepared phosphors exhibit typical anomalous thermal quenching. It is very favorable for the devices working at high temperature. And this phenomenon may benefit from the high energy transfer efficiency at higher temperatures.

The switches show high stabilities and exhibit reversible E/Z isomerization behavior, along with tunable fluorescence intensity in both protic and aprotic media. Switches based on 2‐pyridyl‐ or 2‐pyridylmethyl‐containing N‐components exhibit strong fluorescence in their protonated Z‐configurations, compared to their phenyl/benzyl counterparts. This behavior can be attributed to variations in intramolecular charge transfer or excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer effects.

    "abstract": "Polymethine cyanine dyes have a heterocyclic structure containing nitrogen at both ends of the polymethine chain. They have been extensively investigated in material sciences for numerous applications. The synthesis of cyanine dyes with various functional groups on the methine chain has attracted significant attention because it significantly alters the properties of the dye. However, few synthetic methods have been reported for directly introducing groups onto the methine chains of cyanine dyes. Ketone functional groups are essential in synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials chemistry. However, there are no reports on the direct introduction of ketone groups into cyanine dyes. Trifluoroacetylation is performed on the methine chains of polymethine cyanine dyes. This is achieved by directly using anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid to synthesize trifluoroacetylated trimethine, pentamethine, and heptamethine cyanine dyes in good yields. Single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis is performed to determine the substitution positions in the synthesized dyes. The results reveal that trifluoroacetylation of the methine chain shortens the maximum absorption wavelength and decreases the molar absorption coefficient in dichloromethane solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) film compared to an unsubstituted cyanine dye, and decreases the fluorescence quantum yield. This study highlights the unique properties of trifluoroacetylated polymethine cyanine dyes."

In this Concept, we critically assess the mechanistic underpinnings of anti‐Kasha behavior in radical systems and highlight the experimental caveats that may lead to misinterpretation—including emission from closed‐shell impurities, photodegradation byproducts, or incomplete radical formation. By revisiting key examples and providing a framework for rigorous spectral validation, this article aims to recalibrate the standards of evidence in radical photophysics and guide the development of reliable design strategies for high‐energy emitters."

Herein, bismuth manganate (BMO) is investigated as a photoanode absorber material for PEC. BMO thin films are prepared by a sol–gel method with and without a bismuth oxide (BO) overlayer. It is found that the BO overlayer forms BO nanoislands after annealing. Under visible light illumination, BMO with BO nanoislands results in a nearly tenfold increase of the current density compared to pristine BMO at the same applied potential. This increased performance is related to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and in the amount of recombinations based on the formation of a favorable heterojunction between BMO and BO. The application of overlayers on electrode materials in combination with suitable band alignment is an effective strategy to improve the performance of PEC electrodes."

Photophysical studies, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, reveal strong electronic communication between the porphyrin core and the fullerene unit, corroborated by theoretical calculations demonstrating efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Electrochemical measurements, supported by theoretical insights, confirm that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) energy levels of the C60‐3PV‐ZnP‐2DoH‐COOH dyad are well aligned for effective integration into NiO‐based DSSCs.

The solid form, prepared by maintaining the liquid phase of the complex at 90 °C for 7 days followed by cooling to 25 °C, displays bluish‐purple, purple, orange, and red emissions under excitations at 340, 360, 370, and 380 nm, respectively. Excitation‐dependent emission spectra reveal that the observed color changes result from varying intensity ratios of two emission bands centered at 430 and 652 nm. Control experiments suggest that these excitation‐dependent luminescent properties originate from the coexistence of gold(I)–π aggregates and gold(I)–gold(I)‐interacted oligomers, which exhibit higher and lower bandgap energies, respectively."

A series of Nb2O5 photocatalysts are prepared using a simple thermal approach, and their photocatalytic performance for HMF oxidation is tested. Nb2O5 treated at relatively lower temperatures (300–400 °C) possesses a higher surface area with abundant surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water species, which play a key role in the HMF oxidation, affording high DFF selectivity. In contrast, Nb2O5 treated at higher temperatures (500–600 °C) exhibits an adverse effect on the photocatalytic performance due to the substantial loss of surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water species. Various structural characterizations such as X‐ray diffractometer, N2‐sorption analyses, and thermogravimetric analyser Nb2O5 treated at different temperatures. At the same time, CO2‐temperature programmed desorption (TPD), O2–TPD, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra disclose the nature and distribution of active sites, especially strong basic sites, which is essential for comprehending the interaction between HMF and the surface of the catalyst."

    "abstract": "AbstractFormic acid (FA) is a promising liquid organic hydrogen carrier for safe and efficient hydrogen handling. FA dehydrogenation occurs under near‐ambient conditions using palladium/activated carbon (Pd/AC) catalysts, but aspects like high Pd loading and gradual catalyst deactivation remain key challenges. This study investigates how the physicochemical properties of Pd nanoparticles and support characteristics influence the continuous process performance including FA conversion, evolved gas flow rate, total hydrogen production, and catalyst durability. Pd catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation using various precursors, powdered supports, and Pd loadings and evaluated in a fixed‐bed reactor. The findings reveal that Pd/AC catalysts prepared with PdCl₂ precursor and nanopowdered AC are the most efficient. Strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged PdCl₄2⁻ species and the positively charged AC surface during impregnation enhance nanoparticle support interactions, resulting in small (∼2 nm), highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles with a high Pd2⁺/Pd⁰ atomic surface ratio. Metal dispersion is the dominant factor influencing hydrogen production, surpassing the effects of both particle size and electronic state. Higher Pd loadings also increased catalyst durability, reducing regeneration frequency. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Pd/AC catalysts, paving the way for efficient FA utilization as a hydrogen carrier."

The photocatalyst is a pyrene dione (PD) molecule that has a significant absorbance in the visible light spectrum and can afford a persistent semiquinonate radical owing to the π‐delocalized pyrene backbone. This semiquinonate radical conducts hydrogen atom transfer reactions to facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions of a large number of alcohols. Leveraging on the dehydrogenating ability of PD that easily conducts 2e−/2H+ redox shuttles, olefination reaction was conducted on heteroarene methyl, fluorenes under mild conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic process works under aerobic conditions since oxygen regenerates the catalyst. The methodological development is a significant improvement over many transition metal catalysts for this task, which often work at high temperature and anaerobic reaction conditions."

For some time now, it has been known that shear is unlikely to harm most proteins directly. Rather, interfacial phenomena, particularly those involving dynamic gas‐liquid interfaces are critical contributors to protein damage, which leads to aggregation and compromises stability. This work investigated the kinetic stability of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase (HMFO; EC: 1.1.3.47) in a 2 L stirred tank reactor. Exposure experiments revealed that the leading cause of enzyme deactivation was exposure to the gas‐liquid interface, either produced deliberately when sparging gas into the system or by accidental air entrainment from the overhead space due to mechanical stirring. This was further proven by experiments using the Bio Thrust membrane module, which enabled bubble‐free aeration thus, confirming that exposure to the gas‐liquid interface is the leading cause of deactivation."

FeCo2O4 microcubes, MnCo2O4 microspheres, and CuCo2O4 micro‐octahedrons were produced via an ultrasonication‐assisted hydrothermal approach. The impact of urea (U), semicarbazide (S) as structure directing agents (SDAs), and metal ion substitution (A = Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+) on catalyst morphology and acid–base active sites in cobaltite is confirmed using various material characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The enhanced catalytic properties resulted in a significant improvement in their catalytic performance, particularly in terms of activity and selectivity. The order of yield (Y) and selectivity (S) for GC production is FeCo2O4‐U microcubes (Y95 ± 3%, S99%) > MnCo2O4‐S microspheres (Y91.5 ± 3%, S98.5%) > CuCo2O4‐S micro‐octahedrons (Y83.4 ± 3%, S92.4%) > Co3O4 (Y35 ± 3%, 99%), as determined using the GC‐MS analysis. This performance is attributed to the effective catalytic activation of urea, leading to enhanced GC production via the isocyanic acid pathway. Therefore, the strategies presented in this work could be further extended to other spinel compounds to achieve desired catalytic properties for chemical transformations of industrial interest."

This study introduces a dynamic ML‐guided approach that iteratively optimizes experimental parameters through successive cycles of ML analysis and experimentation, effectively circumventing the need for large datasets. Applied to the synthesis of photocatalysts via microwave heating of quercetin, this method yielded optimal performance after three iterations, achieving a high hydrogen peroxide production rate.

    "abstract": "AbstractUltrasound can remove bubbles and significantly enhance the performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its impact on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is minimal. Improving hydrophilicity has been found to address this issue. CoFeCr LDH/NF, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with good hydrophilicity and a nanoflower structure, is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Hydrophilicity affects the size of bubbles produced, with better hydrophilic electrodes generating smaller, more easily disrupted bubbles. The cavitation effect upon bubble rupture releases heat, breaking water molecules to produce free OH⁻ and promoting the reconstruction of CoFeCr LDH. Additionally, the nanoflower structure of CoFeCr LDH features numerous micropores, enhancing the surface roughness of NF, and resulting in more uniform bubble sizes. Solution convection induced by ultrasound gathers small bubbles into larger ones, which are more easily removed by ultrasound. At 30 mA cm−2, ultrasound reduces the overpotential for HER and OER by 17 mV and 16 mV, respectively. Enhanced hydrophilicity significantly improves the efficiency of CoFeCr LDH/NF in water electrolysis, especially in OER."

The precursor for the skeleton catalyst is a binary magnesium–nickel fluoride solid solution (MgF2–NiF2), synthesized using the precipitation method from magnesium nitrate, nickel nitrate, and ammonium fluoride. Upon reduction at 500 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere, only nickel fluoride is reduced, while magnesium fluoride maintains its structure unchanged, forming the structural framework for nickel nanoparticles. The catalyst achieves a specific surface area of up to 87.2 m2g−1 and a nickel metal surface area of up to 3.06 m2g−1.

    "abstract": "AbstractSulfonic acid group functionalized materials with Brønsted acid sites play a key role in the catalytic conversion of oxygen‐containing compounds with α─O─4 bonds to high‐carbon phenolic compounds. However, it is challenging to generate high‐carbon phenolic compounds with high selectivity due to the limited number of sulfonic acid groups grafted on the carrier and the difficulty in regulating the acid strength. This study utilizes concentrated sulfuric acid to sulfonate poly‐divinylbenzene to obtain sulfonated polymer nanotube catalysts with Brønsted acid sites. Their acid strength was regulated simply by controlling the sulfonation time. The π─π conjugation of the benzene rings in the polymer backbone and the electron‐withdrawing action of sulfonic acid groups alter the electron cloud density of the C─S bond, leading to the dissociation of H+ from sulfonic acid groups. This mechanism facilitates the highly selective alkylation of benzyloxybenzene, yielding bicyclic phenolic compounds, specifically 2‐benzylphenol and 4‐benzylphenol. The optimal material (SPDVB‐14) completely converts benzyloxybenzene into phenolic compounds under mild conditions (140 °C, 0.2 MPa N2, and 1.5 h), achieving a yield of up to 87.5% for both 2‐benzylphenol and 4‐benzylphenol. These high‐carbon phenolic compounds have potential application value in diesel/jet fuel and liquid organic hydrogen carriers."

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper investigates the effect of iron(II) spin state on the catalytic activity of a spin‐crossover (SCO) complex, specifically [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2, in an acetalization reaction. Thanks to its bi‐stability, this complex enables the evaluation of its catalytic activity in both the high‐spin (HS) and low‐spin (LS) states under identical experimental conditions, thereby clearly distinguishing the effects of the spin state from other variables. A notable increase in catalytic efficiency is observed from the low‐spin to the high‐spin state, with the high‐spin complex promoting up to 1.7 times more acetal formation. Extensive experiments across multiple batches of the complex confirm that these findings are both reproducible and representative. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we assessed the activation energy of the process. The activation energies for both spin states were found to be comparable, suggesting that the observed difference in catalytic activity is not due to electronic factors that stabilize the transition state, but rather to easier access to the catalytic active sites in the high‐spin state. This work represents a significant advancement toward developing a switchable catalytic system based on spin‐crossover phenomena, highlighting that the catalytic activity of SCO complexes can be effectively tuned by the spin state of the metal."

    "abstract": "AbstractGroup IB metal catalysts, particularly Ag, Au, and Cu, exhibit particular selectivity for ethylene oxide (EO) formation, while Ag demonstrates the highest performance so far. Previous studies have explored the EO formation mechanism on (100) and (111) surfaces of group IB metals, but the reaction mechanism on the (211) facet (analogous to the edge sites of a catalyst particle) remains poorly understood. Herein, we fill in the knowledge gap by analyzing ethylene partial oxidation to EO on the (211) surfaces of Ag, Au, and Cu through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, scaling relationship analysis, and microkinetic modeling. Our study demonstrates that the (211) surface decreases the energy barrier for the dissociation of oxygen molecules into oxygen atoms, while unfavorable for the production of EO. Therefore, we should preserve an appropriate concentration of (211) surface on the nanoparticles when designing catalysts for the ethylene epoxidation reaction."

    "abstract": "AbstractWe report a biomimetic system for light‐driven CO2 conversion in lipid bilayers using a [FeFe]‐hydrogenase‐inspired molecular dyad (PS‐CAT) acting simultaneously as photosensitizer and catalyst. The molecular design of PS‐CAT consists of both light‐harvesting and catalytically active moieties in a single molecule. This structure allows for efficient charge transfer between these two moieties. The PS‐CAT consists of only an organic chromophore and an iron complex. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2RR) as well as H2 production (HER) was traced over 56 h to determine CO2RR/HER selectivity. The presence of water in the lipid bilayer system allows for CO2RR selectivity >99 % over the competitive HER, outperforming previous molecular, and liposome‐based systems for light‐driven CO2 to CO conversion. The product selectivity in CO2RR (e.g., CO, HCOO−, and CH4) was determined via gas chromatography and NMR spectroscopy with 13C‐labeled carbon sources. The Stern–Volmer quenching studies on the initial light‐driven electron‐transfer revealed static quenching and indicated a preassembly of the PS‐CAT with the electron donor at the membrane‐water interface."

    "abstract": "AbstractAlthough carbon dioxide is a plentiful, affordable, and benign carbon source, its steady rise in the atmosphere as a major greenhouse gas has resulted in significant environmental issues. Herein, we have synthesized a urea‐linked covalent organic framework (TFPTA‐BDU COF) by condensation polymerization. Then Zn (II) ions were impregnated on the N‐rich TFPTA‐BDU COF. The resulting Zn@TFPTA‐BDU COF was obtained. It was characterized by FT‐IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), PXRD (powder X‐ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), EDAX (energy dispersive X‐ray analysis), HR‐TEM (high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy), BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller), and XPS (X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Zn@TFPTA‐BDU COF demonstrates commendable yields (i.e., 54%–88% yields) in CO2 carbonylative coupling reactions, even under mild conditions. On the other hand, this newly synthesized catalyst also showed excellent performance in solvent‐free, room‐temperature oxazolidinones synthesis (with a yield of more than 90%) under sustainable conditions. Additionally, the as‐synthesized microporous COF catalyst demonstrated remarkable durability and can be recycled up to five times without any noticeable loss of its catalytic performance, indicating a true heterogeneous nature, highlighting its reusability, and making it a sustainable and cost‐effective solution. This work paves the way for developing efficient and sustainable CO2 fixation methods using COFs as a catalyst, with broader potential applications."

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study investigates the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of noble metal‐supported cerium oxide (M/CeO2, where M = Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) catalysts for ethanol steam reforming, a promising method for sustainable hydrogen production. A urea‐assisted deposition approach was employed to deposit noble metal nanoparticles uniformly on CeO2 without stabilizers, preserving the support's crystallinity and enhancing reducibility through strong metal‐support interactions. Catalytic tests at 550 °C over 24 h revealed significant differences in activity and the products distribution based on the metal used. Rh/CeO2 demonstrated the highest performance, achieving complete ethanol conversion and 37.75% hydrogen production, attributed to its efficient C─C and C─H bond cleavage. Pt/CeO2 and Ru/CeO2 also displayed high activity and stability, whereas Pd/CeO2 and Au/CeO2 primarily produced acetaldehyde due to preferential C─H bond scission. Post‐reaction analysis confirmed minimal carbon deposition across all catalysts, with Rh/CeO2 exhibiting the highest resistance to coke formation. These findings emphasize the importance of noble metal choice and metal‐support interactions in optimizing catalyst performance. Rh, Pt, and Ru emerged as the most promising candidates for efficient hydrogen production. This study develops advanced catalysts optimized for renewable energy use for hydrogen production via ethanol steam reforming."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Lipid nanoparticle RNA (LNP-RNA) formulations are used for the delivery of vaccines and other therapies. RNA molecules are encapsulated within their interior through electrostatic interactions with positively charged lipids. The identity of the lipids that present at their surface play a role in how they interact with and are perceived by the body and their resultant potency. Here, we use a model formulation to develop cryogenic sample preparation for molecular depth profiling Orbitrap secondary ion mass spectrometry (Cryo-OrbiSIMS) preceded by morphological characterisation using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). It is found that the depth distribution of individual lipid components is revealed relative to the surface and the RNA cargo defining the core. A preferential lipid orientation can be determined for the 1,2-Dimyristoyl-glycero-3-methox-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DMG-PEG2k) molecule, by comparing the profiles of PEG to DMG fragments. PEG fragments are found immediately during analysis of the LNP surface, while the DMG fragments are deeper, coincident with RNA ions located in the core, in agreement with established models of LNPs. This laboratory-based de novo analysis technique requires no labelling, providing advantages over large facility neutron scattering characterisation."

Its activity can be controlled by ligands offering access to pharmacological Nurr1 modulation. However, the binding epitope(s) and molecular activation mechanisms of synthetic Nurr1 activators remained elusive but are essential to advance Nurr1 ligands towards new medicines. Here we characterized Nurr1 dimer dissociation and coregulator release as molecular contributions to Nurr1 activation by vidofludimus and locate its binding in an allosteric surface pocket lined by helices 1, 5, 7, and 8 by mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation. Structure-guided ligand design using these insights resulted in an optimized Nurr1 agonist with substantially enhanced potency and binding affinity. Our results provide a structural and molecular basis for Nurr1 activation by a synthetic agonist which was lacking for rational ligand design."

We show that this reactor does not foul, facilitating continuous operation at an STY of 3.4 × 104 (±1 × 103) kg m−3 day−1 of proton-conducting Ca-NDS (water). ZIF-8 and UiO-66-NH2 MOFs prepared in ultrasound-assisted flow with smaller, uniform particle sizes exhibited matched or superior gas sorption to those made in batch. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted flow synthesis for MOFs, offering enhanced nucleation alongside process intensification, and paving the way for more efficient MOF production."

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Rearrangement reactions are generally considered to be a rapid and synergistic intramolecular reconstructing process that is insensitive to intermolecular intruders. We report that α-iminol rearrangements could be strategically redirected by the interception of Petasis reactions, in the context of being avoided by strong electron-withdrawing groups on the migrative aryl units. 1,4-Aryl migration prevails over 1,2-aryl migration via forming a boron-ate complex. By leveraging this reactivity, we developed a regiospecific synthesis of unsymmetrically 2,3-diaryl substituted indoles from three readily available feedstocks: an amine, an arylglyoxal, and a boronic acid. While traditional Petasis reactions with similar three-component inputs are typically applied to build C(sp3)-C(sp2) and C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds, the present transformation offers a special opportunity for constructing a C(sp2)-C(sp2) linkage. Highly substituted indole motifs with structural diversity in the C2 position are easily accessed by this three-component reaction. A mechanism containing a copper-cobalt collaborative promotion process was suggested."

Despite its significance, the mechanisms influencing ICD in molecular complexes remain unclear. Here, we investigate and unambiguously prove the ICD process in thiophene dimer, an aromatic ring with a third-row atom. Using multi-particle momentum coincidence spectroscopy, accompanied by high-level electronic structure calculations, we elucidate that the ICD process is initiated from the sulfur-containing inner-valence orbitals which are energetically below the Auger threshold. This leads to an enhancement in the emission of low-energy ICD electrons compared to other aromatic ring dimers. By utilizing this ‘ICD-only decay’ contribution we quantify ICD probabilities above the Auger threshold. This study reveals the pivotal role of sulfur in shaping the ICD electron spectrum, which can be implied to control the low-energy electron emission in biological systems."

This approach combines experimental hypotheses with mathematical and physical models, enabling a concise description of complex system dynamics and the extraction of kinetic parameters like kinetic pathways, time constants, and species amplitudes. However, building the final kinetic model requires several intermediate steps, including testing various assumptions and models across multiple experiments. In complex cases, some intermediate states may be unknown and are often simplified. This approach requires expertise in modeling and data comprehension, as poor decisions at any stage during data analysis can lead to an incorrect kinetic model, resulting in inaccurate results. Here, we introduce DLRN, a new deep learning-based framework, designed to rapidly provide a kinetic reaction network, time constants, and amplitude for the system, with comparable performance and, in part, even better than a classical fitting analysis. We demonstrate DLRN’s utility in analyzing multiple timescales datasets with complex kinetics, different 2D systems such as time-resolved spectra and agarose gel electrophoresis data, experimental datasets as nitrogen vacancy and strand displacement circuit (using photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques), even in scenarios where the initial state is a hidden, non-emitting dark state."

Herein, we engineered an OER electrode from abundant stainless steel (SS) via facile approaches, and the obtained electrode consists of a Ni-rich oxide surface layer with a Fe-rich metal substrate. An outstanding activity was observed with an overpotential of 316 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, an electrode self-replenishing concept is proposed in which a Ni-rich catalyst layer can be regenerated from a metallic substrate due to the difference in diffusion and dissolution rates of metal oxides/hydroxides, and this regeneration is validated by various characterizations. A recorded degradation rate of 0.012 was observed at 1000 mA cm−2 for 1000 h. The facile engineering of OER electrodes from SS combined with the self-replenishing catalyst can potentially address the cost, activity, and long-term stability barriers."

We developed a novel t-SPESI unit that can be used in combination with an inverted fluorescence microscope and basic technologies to extract components from microregions of cells and measure ions with high sensitivity. We performed multimodal (fluorescence, lipid ion, and topographic) imaging of two types of HeLa cells labeled with fluorescent dyes and chemically fixed and showed the potential for subcellular-scale analysis of both cell structure and chemical composition. Furthermore, we evaluated the lipid species by comparing the SC-MSI results with those of supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The technical advancement presented here is effective for distinguishing cell types based on the signal intensity of lipid ions in single cells and investigating differences in the subcellular localization of lipids in different types of cells."

Although OAD has been used for untargeted lipidomics, its availability has been limited to the positive ion mode, requiring the independent use of a collision-induced dissociation (CID) method. In this study, we demonstrated the OAD MS/MS technique in the negative-ion mode for profiling phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, and sulfatides, where the fragmentation mechanism remained consistent with that in the positive ion mode. Furthermore, we proposed optimal conditions for the simultaneous acquisition of CID- and OAD-specific fragment ions, termed OAciD, where oxygen atoms and hydroxy radicals facilitate C=C position-specific fragmentation, while residual water vapor induces cleavage of low-energy covalent bonds as observed in CID. Finally, theoretical fragment ions were implemented in MS-DIAL 5 to accelerate C=C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics. The OAciD methodology was used to illuminate brain region-specific marmoset lipidomes with C=C positional information, including the estimation of C=C positional isomer ratios. We also characterized the profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids, finding that lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids were enriched in the cerebellum, whereas those containing omega-6 fatty acids were more abundant in the hippocampus and frontal lobe."

While NOS linkages in proteins were once assumed to occur only between lysine and cysteine, our investigation shows that these bonds extend beyond the well–studied lysine-NOS-cysteine examples. By systematically analyzing over 86,000 high–resolution X-ray protein structures, we uncovered 69 additional NOS bonds, including arginine-NOS-cysteine and glycine-NOS-cysteine. Our pipeline integrates machine learning, quantum–mechanical calculations, and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data to systematically detect these subtle covalent interactions and identify key predictive descriptors for their formation. The discovery of these previously unrecognized linkages broadens the scope of protein chemistry and may enable targeted modulation in drug design and protein engineering. Although our study focuses on NOS linkages, the flexibility of this methodology allows for the investigation of a wide range of chemical bonds and covalent modifications, including structurally resolvable posttranslational modifications (PTMs). By revisiting and re-examining well-established protein models, this work underscores how systematic data-driven approaches can uncover hidden aspects of protein chemistry and inspire deeper insights into protein function and stability."

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL), generated from tryptic digestion of 42 human recombinant proteins, in enhancing the detection and quantification of lower-abundance cancer-associated proteins. Additionally, we generated a combined sample-specific biological-rPSL by integrating the rPSL with a spectral library derived from pooled biological samples. We compared the performance of these libraries for DIA data extraction with standard methods, including sample-specific biological spectral library and library-free DIA methods. Our specific focus was on quantifying cancer-associated proteins, including key enzymes involved in kynurenine pathway, across patient-derived tissues and cell lines. Both rPSL and biological-rPSL-DIA approaches provided significantly improved coverage of lower-abundance proteins, enhancing sensitivity and more consistent protein quantification across matched tumour and adjacent noncancerous tissues from breast and colorectal cancer patients and in cancer cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that rPSL and biological-rPSL coupled with DIA-MS workflows, can address the limitations of both biological library-based and library-free DIA methods, offering a robust approach for quantifying low-abundance cancer-associated proteins in complex biological samples."
