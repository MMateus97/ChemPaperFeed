    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest owing to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.",

However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (k\n            cat = 13 s−1, >1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates.",

We give an overview of the application of the method for artificial post-translational protein modifications and the selective functionalization and directed immobilization of proteins. We highlight the trends in the use of noncanonical amino acids for the analysis of nascent proteomes and the engineering of enzymes and biomaterials, and the progress in the biosynthesis of amino acid analogs.

The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product. We also showcase how synergistic experimental and computational investigations have enabled the elucidation of specific noncovalent interactions responsible for selective stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductors form the foundational bedrock of modern electronics and numerous cutting-edge technologies. Particularly, semiconductors crafted from organic building blocks hold immense promise as next-generation pioneers, thanks to their vast array of chemical structures, customizable frontier orbital energy levels and bandgap structures, and easily adjustable π electronic properties. Over the past 50 years, advancements in chemistry and materials science have facilitated extensive investigations into small organic π compounds, oligomers, and polymers, resulting in a rich library of organic semiconductors. However, a longstanding challenge persists: how to organize π building units or chains into well-defined π structures, which are crucial for the performance of organic semiconductors. Consequently, the pursuit of methodologies capable of synthesizing and/or fabricating organic semiconductors with ordered structures has emerged as a frontier in organic and polymeric semiconductor research. In this context, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) stand out as unique platforms allowing for the covalent integration of organic π units into periodically ordered π structures, thus facilitating the development of semiconductors with extended yet precisely defined π architectures. Since their initial report in 2008, significant strides have been made in exploring various chemistries to develop semiconducting COFs, resulting in a rich library of structures, properties, functions, and applications. This review provides a comprehensive yet focused exploration of the general structural features of semiconducting COFs, outlining the basic principles of structural design, illustrating the linkage chemistry and synthetic strategies based on typical one-pot polymerization reactions to demonstrate the growth of bulk materials, nanosheets, films, and membranes. By elucidating the interactions between COFs and various entities such as photons, phonons, electrons, holes, ions, molecules, and spins, this review categorizes semiconducting COFs into nine distinct sections: semiconductors, photoconductors, light emitters, sensors, photocatalysts, photothermal conversion materials, electrocatalysts, energy storage electrodes, and radical spin materials, focusing on disclosing structure-originated properties and functions. Furthermore, this review scrutinizes structure-function correlations and highlights the unique features, breakthroughs, and challenges associated with semiconducting COFs. Furnished with foundational knowledges and state-of-the-art insights, this review predicts the fundamental issues to be addressed and outlines future directions for semiconducting COFs, offering a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving and remarkable field.",

This Review examines key studies to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy. Two DPL methods, in particular, show great promise: organic azide/diazirine cross-linkers (Z-cross-linkers) and UV-cross-linkable organic semiconducting blends (X-blends). These methods not only simplify the photolithography process significantly but also enhance the chemical and physical resistance of patterned organic semiconductors against photolithographic chemicals and tandem solution-depositions. Consequently, these advancements enable the fabrication of organic integrated circuits entirely through solution processes. In conclusion, photolithography of organic semiconductors serves a dual purpose: it facilitates the patterning of active layers for OFETs and acts as an enabling technology for fabricating sophisticated and cost-effective organic integrated circuits.",

    "abstract": "The study of interfacial properties in liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor systems has a history of nearly 200 years, with significant contributions from scientific luminaries such as Thomas Young and Willard Gibbs. However, a similar level of understanding of solid-liquid interfaces has emerged only more recently, largely because of the numerous complications associated with the thermodynamics needed to describe them. The accurate calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid-liquid systems is central to determining which interfaces will be observed and their properties. However, designing and analyzing the molecular dynamics simulations required to do this remains challenging, unlike the liquid-liquid or liquid-vapor cases, because of the unique complications associated with solid-liquid systems. Specifically, the lattice structure of solids introduces spatial directionality, and atomic configurations in solids can be altered by stretching. The primary aim of this review is to provide an overview of the numerical approaches developed to address the challenge of calculating the interfacial free energy in solid-liquid systems. These approaches are classified as (i) direct methods, which compute interfacial free energies explicitly, albeit often through convoluted procedures, and (ii) indirect methods, which derive these free energies as secondary results obtained from the analysis of simulations of an idealized experimental configuration. We also discuss two key topics related to the calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid-liquid systems: nucleation theory and curved interfaces, which represent important problems where research remains highly active.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence emitters with a multiple-resonant (MR) effect have become a research hotspot. These MR emitters mainly consist of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with boron/nitrogen, nitrogen/carbonyl, and indolocarbazole frameworks. The staggered arrangement of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital facilitates MR, resulting in smaller internal reorganization energy and a narrower emission bandwidth. Optimal charge separation suppresses the energy gap between singlet and triplet excited states, favoring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). These MR-TADF materials, due to color purity and high emission efficiency, are excellent candidates for organic light-emitting diodes. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain; in particular, the limitation imposed by the alternated core configuration hinders their diversity and versatility. Most existing MR-TADF materials are concentrated in the blue-green range, with only a few in red and near-infrared spectra. This review provides a timely and comprehensive screening of MR emitters from their pioneering work to the present. Our goal is to gain understandings of the MR-TADF structure-performance relationship from both basic and advanced perspectives. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the correlations between chemical structure, photophysical properties and electroluminescent performance in both depth and breadth with an aim to promote the future development of MR emitters.",

Understanding the factors that influence the ECW is an essential step toward designing more robust and high-performance electrochemical systems. This review provides a detailed classification of the various \"windows\" of SEs and a comprehensive understanding of the associated interfacial stability of SEs in full battery application. The paper begins with a historical overview of SE development, followed by a detailed discussion of their structural characteristics. Next, examination of various methodologies used to calculate and measure the ECW is presented, culminating in the proposal of standardized testing procedures. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the numerous parameters that influence the thermodynamic ECW of SEs is provided, along with a synthesis of strategies to address these challenges. At last, this review concludes with an in-depth exploration of the interfacial issues associated with SEs exhibiting narrow ECWs in full SSLBs.",

We then identify innovative in situ and operando techniques to directly probe the photoelectrode|electrolyte interface, enabling direct assessment of structure-property relationships for catalytic surfaces in active reaction environments. We close by considering more complex photoelectrochemical fuel-forming reactions (carbon dioxide and nitrogen reduction, as well as alternative oxidation reactions), where product selectivity imposes additional criteria on electrochemical driving force and photoelectrode architecture. By contextualizing recent literature within a fundamental framework, we seek to provide direction for continued progress toward achieving efficient and stable fuel-forming photoelectrodes.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils are characteristic features of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The use of small molecule ligands that bind to amyloid fibrils underpins both fundamental research aiming to better understand the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, and clinical research aiming to develop diagnostic tools for these diseases. To date, a large number of amyloid-binding ligands have been reported in the literature, predominantly targeting protein fibrils composed of amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and α-synuclein (αSyn) fibrils. Fibrils formed by a particular protein can adopt a range of possible morphologies, but protein fibrils formed in vivo possess disease-specific morphologies, highlighting the need for morphology-specific amyloid-binding ligands. This review details the morphologies of Aβ, tau, and αSyn fibril polymorphs that have been reported as a result of structural work and describes a database of amyloid-binding ligands containing 4,288 binding measurements for 2,404 unique compounds targeting Aβ, tau, or αSyn fibrils.",

This paper reviews a variety of key benchmarking techniques, including Randomized Benchmarking, Quantum Process Tomography, Gate Set Tomography, Process Fidelity Estimation, Direct Fidelity Estimation, and Cross-Entropy Benchmarking. We evaluate each method's complexities, the resources they require, and their effectiveness in addressing coherent, incoherent, and state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Furthermore, we introduce Deterministic Benchmarking (DB), a novel protocol that minimizes the number of experimental runs, exhibits resilience to SPAM errors, and effectively characterizes both coherent and incoherent errors. The implementation of DB is experimentally validated using a superconducting transmon qubit, and the results are substantiated with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations. With the addition of DB to the toolkit of available benchmarking methods, this article serves as a practical guide for choosing and applying benchmarking protocols to advance quantum computing technologies.",

    "abstract": "The exciton Bohr radius is a defining feature in conventional quantum dot physics. Three distinct confinement regimes are usually recognized: the weak, intermediate, and strong confinement regimes. Which of these is relevant depends on the relative size of the quantum dot in terms of the exciton Bohr radius. However, this classification is primarily based on the linear optical properties of the nanocrystal. During the transition from the molecule to the bulk crystal, structural, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties change as well. In this review, we discuss the cluster regime, where the exciton experiences extreme confinement. In the cluster regime, not only do linear optical properties deviate significantly from the effective mass approximation, but other material properties also begin to deviate from their bulk values. These deviations are only observable in the size regime, where the intrinsic length scales are much smaller than the exciton Bohr radius. Crucially, computational methods allow chemists to explore this region far more quantitatively than in the past.",

    "abstract": "In the information age, novel hardware solutions are urgently needed to efficiently store and process increasing amounts of data. In this scenario, memory devices must evolve significantly to provide the necessary bit capacity, performance, and energy efficiency needed in computation. In particular, novel computing paradigms have emerged to minimize data movement, which is known to contribute the largest amount of energy consumption in conventional computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture. In-memory computing (IMC) provides a means to compute within data with minimum data movement and excellent energy efficiency and performance. To meet these goals, resistive-switching random-access memory (RRAM) appears to be an ideal candidate thanks to its excellent scalability and nonvolatile storage. However, circuit implementations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models require highly specialized device properties that need careful RRAM device engineering. This work addresses the RRAM concept from materials, device, circuit, and application viewpoints, focusing on the physical device properties and the requirements for storage and computing applications. Memory applications, such as embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) in novel microcontroller units (MCUs) and storage class memory (SCM), are highlighted. Applications in IMC, such as hardware accelerators of neural networks, data query, and algebra functions, are illustrated by referring to the reported demonstrators with RRAM technology, evidencing the remaining challenges for the development of a low-power, sustainable AI.",

Nonetheless, the success of this reaction requires full control over diastereoselectivity, eradication of a parasitic process of over-reduction or migration of the C-C double bond formed, and achieving satisfactory functional-group compatibility. The review demonstrates developments in the field of alkyne semihydrogenation over the period 2010-2022, with selected papers published in 2023 and 2024, emphasizing solutions to the above-mentioned limitations. We discuss mechanistic aspects of this transformation, including those related to unconventional systems. The review includes examples of applications of alkyne semihydrogenation in organic synthesis, confirming the considerable utility of this process. Finally, strategies to enhance catalyst selectivity are summarized. For the reader's convenience, we provided a graphical guidebook to catalytic systems, illustrating the efficiency of the particular method.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe exploitation of combustion of materials stands as a cornerstone of early human development. A theoretical framework for this field began to take shape only around 1700 and finally achieved a sound foundation through the electronic quantum-chemical oxidation concepts of the 20th century. Eventually, a decade ago the IUPAC defined the essential rules for a unique definition of atomic oxidation states (OS) or OS numbers in molecules and extended structures. In specific cases, however, these rules need be tailored to specific chemical observations, including amazing experiences with the heaviest elements. We review our findings and updated interpretations, particularly with regard to previously unexpected trends in the highest oxidation states (HOS) of heavy atomic compounds.The HOS is a qualitative integer parameter for characterizing the chemistry of an element. It is determined by three basic factors: (i) by the number g of loosely bound electrons in the atom's valence shell, usually related to its group number G in the periodic table (g = G mod 10, with mod meaning g = 2 to 8 for G = 12-18); (ii) by the fraction of these g electrons that can be chemically activated and may fall below g toward the end of a series; and (iii) by the local and long-range \"environmental\" conditions (mainly the interaction strengths of the ligands), which range from those in normal life, laboratories and industry, to more extreme conditions such as deep inside the Earth, outside in cosmic space, or in special laboratories.In recent years, our group has systematically investigated the regularity of the HOS over the periodic table, in particular the electronic structures of compounds of various d- (transition metals) and f-block elements (lanthanides and actinides), applying both density-functional approximations and more advanced quantum-chemical methods. Details of the HOS values in the border ranges of feasibility, depending on thermodynamic environment and ligand-interaction capabilities, are conceptually analyzed, incorporating also discoveries of other researchers. The patterns of the HOS from the light s- and sp- to the heavy d- and f-block elements are elucidated, showing systematic deviations from simple textbook rules. The particularly large and small Core-Valence (CV) orbital-energy gaps at, respectively, the upper-right and lower-left corners of the periodic table interrupt the regular trends of the HOS of the sp-block elements, causing HOS < g (as for O or Pt) or HOS > g (as for Cs or Ra). On the other hand, the d-transition metals (TM) and also the actinide 5f-series (An) in the middle of the periodic table show a more uniform variation of the HOS with one common maximum at 8(±1), while the lanthanide 4f-series (Ln) shows two lower HOS maxima, due to their peculiarly small 4f-orbital radii and varying energies.Our report is intended both as a summary of knowledge, as a distillation of new insights, and as a roadmap for further research into the oxidation phenomena.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusRadical migration represents a powerful strategy for reaction discovery and development in organic synthesis, offering access to unprecedented functional molecules and chemical space. In this Account, we describe our contributions to the field, particularly focusing on 1,2-radical acyloxy migration (RAM), a process involving the transposition of a radical and an acyloxy group. We highlight its application in carbohydrate modification and allyl carboxylate trifunctionalization, demonstrating how this reactivity enables the streamlined synthesis of novel glycomimetics and facilitates selective 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. These advances establish 1,2-RAM as a versatile platform for catalytic radical transformations, unlocking new opportunities in reaction development and functional molecule design.Our approach leverages excited-state palladium and ground-state nickel catalysis to modify carbohydrates, specifically at the C2 position. This strategy enables C2-deoxy-hydrogenation, deuteration, iodination, alkenylation, allylation, ketonylation, and arylation reactions, providing direct access to unprecedented glycomimetics. These transformations streamline the synthesis of structurally diverse glycomimetics, facilitating the discovery and development of carbohydrate-based functional molecules. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance of these catalytic systems make them particularly attractive for late-stage functionalization, broadening their applicability in complex molecule synthesis.Beyond carbohydrates, we have extended 1,2-RAM reactivity to achieve unprecedented 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. By employing excited-state phosphine catalysis, we demonstrate a 1,3-carbobromination reaction accompanied by an acyloxy shift. This proof-of-concept study lays the foundation for developing a broader range of 1,2,3-trifunctionalization reactions, effectively transforming allyl carboxylates into substituted isopropyl carboxylate donors. This advancement expands the synthetic utility of allyl carboxylates, enabling the rapid construction of structurally diverse molecular scaffolds.In summary, the 1,2-RAM reactivity opens a new avenue for reaction discovery and development, granting access to new functional molecules and chemical space. The mild conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and unique reactivity of this approach make it a valuable tool for chemical synthesis. We anticipate that merging 1,2-RAM with other catalytic platforms will further advance bond disconnection strategies, provide access to new functional molecules, and expand the frontiers of chemical synthesis.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe bacterial cell wall is a complex structure that is primarily composed of peptidoglycan (PG), which provides protection from the environment and structural rigidity for the cell. As such, PG plays an important role in bacterial survival, which has made its biosynthesis a crucial target for antibiotic development for many decades. Despite long-standing efforts to inhibit PG construction, much remains unknown about the enzymes required for PG biosynthesis or how PG composition and architecture are altered to enable adaptation to environmental stressors. This knowledge will be crucial in the identification of new ways to interfere with PG construction that could overcome widespread resistance to cell wall-targeting antibacterial agents.All bacterial species possess a suite of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are critical actors in PG construction and remodeling, as well as the main targets of β-lactam antibiotics. While the importance of the PBPs is well-known, the field lacks a complete understanding of PBP activity regulation, localization, and critical protein-protein interactions during the growth and division process. Bacteria possess between 4 and 16 PBP homologues with only one or several being genetically essential in each cell. A key outstanding question about these proteins is why bacteria expend the energy required to maintain this relatively large number of related proteins when so few are required to maintain life. The Carlson lab focuses on the development of chemical tools to address this fundamental question. In particular, we have generated a suite of chemical probes to selectively target one or a small number of PBP homologues in their catalytically active state. These activity-based probes (ABPs) have and will continue to enable a deeper understanding of the traits that differentiate the PBPs over the bacterial lifespan.In this account, we discuss the development of selective chemical tools to study the PBPs. Key to our success has been assessment of the PBP inhibition profiles of an expansive set of commercially available β-lactams in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This work has directly identified molecules that can be used in chemical genetic studies and provided scaffolds for the generation of PBP-selective ABPs. We also discovered a novel β-lactone scaffold that is exquisitely selective for PBPs over other protein classes and targets a different subclass of these proteins than related β-lactams. Using these probes, we have explored PG biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis yielding new insights about their cell wall construction and remodeling processes, as well as specialized activities under stress.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusCarbon-based materials─often with superlative electronic, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties─are often categorized by dimensionality and hybridization. Most of these categories are produced in high-temperature conditions that afford equilibrium-dictated structures, but limit their diversity. In contrast, an emerging class of one-dimensional (1D) carbon materials, coined nanothreads, are accessible through kinetically controlled solid-state reactions of small multiply unsaturated molecules. While abundant in molecular organic synthesis, exerting kinetic control over reactivity is a revolutionary approach to access dense carbon networks. Owing to their internal diamond-like core, these materials are calculated to span a wide range of mechanical and optical properties, with the introduction of functional groups and/or heteroatoms leading to tailorable band gaps and the potential to access electronic states that are not featured in traditional polymers or nanomaterials. Accessing these properties requires the ability to precisely control solid-state molecular reaction pathways, chemical connectivity, and heteroatom/functional group density. Carbon nanothreads are often synthesized through the pressure-induced polymerization of aromatic molecules (e.g., benzene, pyridine, and thiophene) upon compression to 23-40 GPa. While the high pressures required to achieve these crystalline materials often preclude making synthetically viable quantities of product, the use of lessened aromatic reactants, along with light and/or heat, enables more mild reaction pressures. Success to date in forming nanothreads from diverse reactants suggests that physical organic principles govern the reaction, along with topochemical relationships, enabling the emergence of a new field of carbon chemistry that combines the control of organic chemistry with the range of physical properties only possible in extended periodic solids.In this Account, we describe our efforts to rationally synthesize carbon nanothreads with desired structures and present our approaches to dictate reactivity in the organic solid state that enable the formation of crystalline 1D carbon materials. In particular, we focus on the principles being pursued by our group to expand the chemical diversity of materials being accessed, while highlighting efforts that both enhance selectivity over reaction pathways and reduce pressure requirements for polymerization. We begin by leveraging starting materials with lessened or no aromaticity (relative to benzene) to design new backbones while enabling lower pressures such as 15-20 GPa to achieve nanothread formation. Next, we discuss efforts to utilize photochemical activation as a means to dictate the reaction pathway and/or affect the mechanism while also achieving ordered crystalline solids at reduced pressures. Lastly, we highlight efforts to demonstrate kinetic control in solid-state reactions by leveraging supramolecular chemistry (e.g., aryl/perfluoroaryl interactions, hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking) to preorganize starting materials into polymerizable molecular stacks. The resultant design principles provide multiple opportunities to attain previously inaccessible sp3-rich 1D polymeric carbon nanomaterials with unique structures and properties from widely available small molecules. Moreover, the kinetic control provided in the organic solid state enables a priori functionalization and the design of a rich diversity of materials with emergent properties in stark contrast to many well-developed carbon materials.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn this Accounts article, we summarize our recent work on truncating conjugated two-dimensional framework materials down to a single pore, or a single macrocycle. Conjugated 2D architectures have emerged as one of the most synthetically adaptable motifs for coupling semiconductivity and porosity in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, despite their prevalence, 2D architectures have several limitations. In particular, the strong interlayer π-π stacking can limit both processability and the accessibility of internal active sites. We have found that simple macrocycles preserve key aspects of 2D framework structure and function, including porosity and out-of-plane electrical conductivity, while providing improved processability, surface tunability, and mass transport properties. In this article, we first describe our synthetic approach and general design considerations. Specifically, we show how ditopic analogues of the tritopic ligands commonly found in the synthesis of 2D MOFs and COFs can be used to achieve a diverse library of conjugated macrocycles that resemble fragments of semiconducting frameworks in both form and function. The length of the peripheral side chains, the size of the aromatic core, and the solubility of intermediates are all key variables in favoring selective macrocycle formation over undesired linear polymers and oligomers. Next, we highlight the unique advantages that macrocycles provide, including improved processability, atomically precise surface tunability, and greater active site accessibility. In particular, the identity of the peripheral side chains dramatically impacts both solubility and colloidal stability as well as crystal size and morphology. We further show how the solution processability and nanoscale dimensions of macrocycles can simplify electronic device fabrication and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, we end with a forward-looking discussion on how macrocycles offer a unique bridge between conjugated molecules and extended frameworks, enabling new application areas and fundamental science.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe ongoing accumulation of plastic waste in landfills and in the environment is driving research on chemical processes and catalysts to recycle polymers. Traditional modeling strategies are not applicable to these processes because they involve too many reactants and intermediates, one for each molecular weight and each functionalization. To model the kinetics, we have developed population balance models (PBMs) that account for macromolecular reactants in the bulk and macromolecular catalytic intermediates. These PBMs couple to each other through polymer adsorption and desorption models and to traditional rate equations for small molecule products and co-reactants (like hydrogen or ethylene). The models, in combination with experimental data, are being used in many ways: (i) to test mechanistic hypotheses, (ii) to extract rate parameters, (iii) to quantitatively compare catalyst activities, (iv) to account for mass transfer and vapor-liquid partitioning in two-phase reactors, and (v) to design novel support architectures and catalysts that mimic the processive action of natural depolymerization enzymes. Some key theoretical advances allow PBMs to be constructed from elementary rates and mechanisms, as opposed to traditional formulations with pseudoelementary rate parameters invoked as fitting parameters. We discuss ways to build these models \"bottom-up\" from first-principles calculations and ways to extract model parameters from \"top down\" analyses of rate data. The combination provides a quantitative bridge between first-principles calculations and the kinetics of complex macromolecular transformations for polymer upcycling and beyond.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusAdsorptive and membrane separations are recognized as highly energy-efficient technologies, critically dependent on the properties of adsorbent and membrane materials. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs), such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal-organic cages (MOCs), and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), have emerged as exceptional candidates for high-performance adsorbents and membranes due to their intrinsic structural tunability. Their orderly pore structure, high porosity, and large surface facilitate gas storage and separation processes. Furthermore, modifying the inner surface, controlling the pore size, and regulating the framework flexibility can significantly enhance CPMs' adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Therefore, the precise structure regulation of CPMs is the key to optimizing gas separation and purification.Reticular chemistry is the use of strong chemical bonds to connect discrete molecular structures (molecules or molecular clusters) to create extended structures, such as CPMs. It allows precise atomic-level control and offers a method for regulating the structures of CPMs, enabling tailored pore environments that enhance selectivity for target separations. This approach is crucial to designing effective gas separation materials. For example, by functionalizing organic ligands, regulating metal ions, and modifying secondary building units, the pore size, porosity, and functionality of CPMs can be finely controlled while keeping the framework topology unchanged, thereby optimizing the gas separation performance.In this Account, we present an overview of our group's research efforts on optimizing gas separation by fine-tuning CPM adsorbents and membranes. Using reticular chemistry, we have developed strategies such as multiple cooperative regulation, adaptive pore control, pore environment engineering, preprocessed monomer interfacial polymerization, and precursor solution processing to create highly selective CPM adsorbents and membranes. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of multiple hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions between CPMs and hydrocarbon molecules. By precise structural regulation, we further optimize the gas separation performance and broaden CPMs' applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for CPM adsorbents and membranes, including material design, synthesis, stability, performance, and the structure-activity relationship. We also propose a membrane-adsorptive separation coupling technology as a potential solution for achieving high-purity gas separation. By utilizing CPM-based adsorbents and membranes, we aim to establish an energy-intensive and environmentally friendly pathway for the separation of low-carbon hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and natural gas, providing a sustainable alternative to conventional high-energy gas separation processes.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSingle-atom skeletal editing strategies that precisely modify the core frameworks of molecules have the potential to streamline and accelerate organic synthesis by enabling conceptually simple, but otherwise synthetically challenging, retrosynthetic disconnections. In contrast to broader skeletal remodeling and rearrangement strategies, these methodologies more specifically target single-atom changes with high selectivity, even within complex molecules such as natural products or pharmaceuticals. For the past several years, our laboratory has developed several skeletal editing methodologies, including single-atom ring contractions, expansions, and transpositions of both saturated and unsaturated heterocycles, as well as other carbon scaffolds. This Account details the evolution of \"skeletal editing logic\" within the context of our extensive work on natural product total synthesis.Early work in the Sarpong group leveraged metal-mediated C-C bond cleavage of in situ-generated strained intermediates to accomplish total syntheses of natural products, such as the icetexane diterpenoids and cyathane diterpenes. Continuing our focus on leveraging C-C bond cleavage through \"break-it-to-make-it\" strategies, we then developed carvone remodeling strategies to access a variety of terpenoids (including longiborneol sesquiterpenoids, phomactins, and xishacorenes) from hydroxylated pinene derivatives. In applying this skeletal remodeling and C-C cleavage framework to alkaloid natural products, such as the preparaherquimides and lycodine-type alkaloids, we recognized that single-atom changes to the saturated nitrogen-containing rings within these natural products would enable the direct conversion between distinct but structurally related natural product families. Thus, we began developing methods that selectively modify the core frameworks of N-heterocycles; this focus led to our work on the deconstructive fluorination and diversification of piperidines and ultimately to our recent body of work on direct, single-atom core framework modifications (single-atom skeletal editing). In the context of saturated heterocycles, we developed photomediated enantioselective ring contractions of α-acylated motifs and reductive ring contractions of cyclic hydroxylamines. For unsaturated heterocycles, we have developed ring contractions of azines (e.g., pyrimidine to pyrazole), 15N isotopic labeling of azines, and phototranspositions of indazoles to benzimidazoles. To direct our focus on reaction development, a cheminformatic analysis of heteroaromatic skeletal edits served to quantitatively inform which transformations would most significantly expand the accessible chemical space. Apart from heterocycles, we also reported single-nitrogen insertion through the reductive amination of carbonyl C-C bonds. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop mild and selective skeletal editing methodologies that can be applied to total synthesis and organic synthesis more generally. While recent total syntheses from our group have targeted simplified retrosyntheses through single-atom skeletal editing logic (e.g., daphenylline and harringtonolide), multiple steps were still required to achieve the formal desired \"edit\". As such, the continued development of truly single-step, mild, and selective reactions that can edit the cores of highly complex molecules remains highly desirable.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe world's plastics production continues to grow and could triple by 2060. Unfortunately, only a small proportion of these plastics are currently recycled (around 30%). The remainder is incinerated (around 40%), causing high greenhouse gas emissions, or buried (around 30%), resulting in high levels of microplastic pollution. Ambitious national and international policies have been put in place to increase the proportion of recycled plastics, and major research efforts are underway to improve plastic recycling processes. Unfortunately, all recycling processes (chemical, physical, and biological) require batches of plastics to be recycled that are as homogeneous as possible. Rigorous waste sorting is therefore essential, and marking plastics with luminescent markers could provide a solution. It could also enable circular and short-loop recycling in which an object is recycled into an identical object.Heterolanthanide coordination polymers are particularly promising candidates for this application. They have demonstrated their effectiveness in the field of anticounterfeiting marking. However, their use in materials traceability requires other assets, such as markers with luminescence properties that are sufficiently different and sufficiently intense for them to be easily identified on a rapid sorting line, as laboratory analysis is no longer relevant for this application.To prepare such a range of compounds, it is necessary to master the mechanisms that govern luminescence properties. The choice of ligand and metal centers, crystal structure, and particle shaping all have a major influence on luminescence properties. Our group has been working on understanding these phenomena for some 20 years.Using as an example the family of heterolanthanide coordination polymers with general chemical formula [Ln2(bdc)3(H2O)4]∞, where bdc2- represents benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate, we wish to present here the various levers that can be used to modulate the emission colors and increase the luminescence intensity of heterolanthanide coordination polymers and describe a family of markers that can be used in the field of materials traceability. Beyond the choice of the metallic centers and of the ligands, markers can be designed in the form of core-shell particles, with an intermediate optically nonactive insulating shell that separates the core from the shell that are both made of optically active molecular alloys. Intermetallic energy transfers are therefore minimized, resulting in increased luminescence intensity and emission color modulation. In conclusion, we would like to draw up a rough sketch of what could be the markers used in the field of plastics traceability.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSingle atom catalysis has garnered widespread attention in the past decade. In general, single atom catalysis refers to a catalytic process involving the participation of single atom sites. A single atom site refers to an active site with only one metal atom playing the main role in the catalysis process. This metal atom is usually coordinated by other atoms in the active site and anchored on the support. Heterogeneous catalysts in which all active sites are single atom sites are referred to as single atom site catalysts (SASCs). Owing to their distinctive active site architecture, single atom catalysis has shown ultrahigh atomic utilization efficiency and unique catalytic activity and selectivity in many systems such as thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.However, the preparation of SASCs poses significant challenges as metal species tend to sinter and agglomerate during high-temperature treatment. In the past decade, we have challenged the controllable preparation of SASCs based on more than ten years of experience in nanomaterial synthesis. Several representative SASC preparation strategies have been proposed by our group, such as pyrolysis of MOFs with metal ions doped in the skeleton, M@ZIF-8 with a metal precursor fixed by the host-guest interaction, and M/N-rich support precursors. Additionally, \"top-down\" strategies starting from metal nanoparticles have been established. Based on these synthetic strategies, a systematic SASCs toolbox has been successfully built.In addition to the SASCs, we have expanded the toolbox to include the dual-atom-site catalysts (DASCs) (including active sites with dual active metal atoms or including dual kinds of single atom sites) and nanosingle-atom-site catalysts (NSASCs) (catalysts with both single atom sites and nanoparticle/cluster sites). With the help of a variety of \"tools\" in the toolbox, single atom catalysis has shown its application value in many important processes such as bulk chemical catalysis, fine chemical catalysis, energy catalysis, and environmental catalysis. Based on laboratory-scale research, we further explored the feasibility of single atom catalysis in industrial catalysis and successfully applied single atom catalysis to industrial-level automobile exhaust purification, which will soon achieve commercialization.This Account provides a concise overview of the evolution of single atom catalysis, summarizes the preparation strategies for SASCs pioneered by our group over the past decade, and highlights the SASCs toolbox developed through these strategies. We also showcase the practical applications of the SASCs toolbox in key catalytic fields, highlight our progress in advancing the industrialization of single atom catalysis (particularly for automobile exhaust purification), and discuss the future prospects of single atom catalysis in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusOxidative decarboxylative coupling (ODC) reactions have been recognized as powerful alternatives to traditional cross-coupling reactions due to the ability to generate (hetero)biaryl structures from simple and readily available carboxylic acid precursors. These reactions, however, are underdeveloped due to the requirement for ortho-nitrobenzoate coupling partners and silver salts as oxidants. Our research program has focused on the development of new catalytic ODC reactions, as well as mechanistic studies of these reactions to uncover the origin of these synthetic limitations. As the framework for these studies, we explored two key ODC reactions developed in our group: (1) a Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation reaction that relies on silver as the oxidant and (2) a Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction capable of operating under aerobic conditions. Our findings, disclosed in this Account, have uncovered the importance of the ortho-substituent and revealed that Ag-based oxidants are also responsible for mediating the decarboxylation and transmetalation steps.Systematic exploration of the decarboxylation of a series of well-defined Ag-benzoate complexes allowed us to probe the importance of the ortho-nitro group in the decarboxylation step. Kinetic measurements of a large series of differently substituted benzoates were found to correlate with the field effect (F) of the ortho-substituent, revealing this feature to be responsible for the enhanced reactivity of these favored benzoates.Our studies of the Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation reaction uncovered an unexpected redox transmetalation step in this system. Synthesis and isolation of the proposed nickelacycle and Ag-aryl intermediates enabled direct study of the fundamental coupling steps. Catalytic and stoichiometric reactions of these complexes, paired with DFT calculations, supported a redox transmetalation step in which the Ag-aryl intermediate transfers the aryl ligand from AgI to NiII with concomitant oxidation to generate a NiIII-bis(aryl) intermediate.Finally, detailed mechanistic studies of our Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction demonstrated how this catalyst system is able to use O2 as the terminal oxidant. Kinetic studies paired with the synthesis and reactivity of well-defined copper intermediates revealed decarboxylation from a CuI-benzoate resting state, despite the oxidizing reaction conditions which could support higher oxidation state intermediates. We also identified the intermediacy of diphenyl disulfide (PhSSPh) formed from the thiophenol (PhSH) coupling partner under the aerobic Cu-catalyzed conditions. The reaction of PhSSPh with the catalyst proceeds via oxidative transfer of the PhS fragment to CuI that is analogous to that of the redox transmetalation observed in Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation.These studies combined suggest significant implications for ODC reactions more broadly. For example, it appears that silver is important for mediating the decarboxylation step when the catalyst is unable (as is the case with nickel) but is not needed when the catalyst is an efficient decarboxylation mediator on its own (as with copper). Furthermore, silver plays an additional role in mediating an oxidative transfer of the coupling partner in arylation reactions but is not required when the coupling partner is itself oxidizing (such as PhSSPh). We anticipate that these mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of new ODC reactions that operate under milder conditions and with broader substrate scopes.",

Advancements in genetic sequencing facilitates association of genotypes and phenotypes, independent of biochemical mechanism. Through the biochemical reconstitution of the interactions between biological macromolecules─including the small molecules (ligands and metabolites) and proteins─that participate in these biological pathways, scientists can characterize the specific molecular features that link genotype and phenotype. This facilitates identification of targets within these pathways that can be manipulated to achieve a greater understanding of the biological process or to develop interventions to improve human health outcomes.Specifically, we describe how this toolbox was leveraged to discover and characterize the molecular biochemistry underlying control of pathogenicity in the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Concurrent with advancements in the investigative tools available to the scientific community, we and others reported on the genetic, molecular, and biochemical/biophysical components of this regulatory system. Virulence control in S. aureus is achieved through a chemical system of bacterial cell-to-cell communication indexed to local population density, referred to as quorum sensing (QS). We and our collaborators identified that this QS system is encoded in the accessory gene regulator (agr) operon and functions via the biosynthesis, secretion, and accumulation of a short peptide signaling molecule─the autoinducing peptide (AIP)─in the local environment correlated with the growth of S. aureus in the same biological niche. Above a threshold concentration, these AIPs bind and activate a cell-surface receptor to stimulate an intracellular response resulting in altered gene expression and bacterial group behaviors. We discovered that chemical modification of these AIPs often generates molecules that exhibit potent inhibition of agr QS, with demonstrated therapeutic potential to treat S. aureus infections. We went on to characterize the biochemical mechanism of signaling molecule biosynthesis and receptor activation in controlled systems through in vitro reconstitution of the constituent enzymes and substrates. Biochemical reconstitution enabled quantitative assessment of biophysical parameters. These efforts culminated in the comprehensive characterization and functional in vitro reconstitution of agr QS in a synthetic system in a minimal model at the interface of genotype, mechanism, and phenotype.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusPolymer self-assembly plays a crucial role across various fields, such as biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Over the years, self-assembly in solution has attracted significant interest. In 2007, our group, in collaboration with Prof. Ian Manners, published a groundbreaking article in Science on living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of amphiphilic block copolymers featuring a crystalline core-forming block. This study focused on polyferrocenylsilane block copolymers (PFS BCPs). Living CDSA operates similarly to living polymerization, enabling the precise fabrication of micelles with predictable shapes and dimensions. The crystalline nature of the core-forming block promotes the formation of structures with low interfacial curvature, such as cylinders and platelets, which are rarely formed in traditional self-assembly techniques based on microphase separation.Over the past two decades, we have pioneered a range of strategies to create one-dimensional (1D), 2D, 3D, and hierarchical uniform PFS BCP structures via CDSA. This method has also been extended to other semicrystalline polymer systems to produce regular and uniform assemblies. While 1D and 2D micelles have been extensively studied, the fabrication of 3D structures remains relatively rare. Nature, however, possesses exquisite 3D structures. Although CDSA has generated some 3D structures, it has not yet achieved the complexity found in nature. Researchers continue to push boundaries toward creating more intricate 3D structures.In this Account, we summarize our research advancements on 3D structure fabrication via CDSA. The free energy of the system, influenced by various factors, ultimately determines micellar morphology and growth behavior. Our work has led to the formation of branched structures through multistep seeded growth processes, incorporating PFS homopolymers (HP) with PFS BCP, manipulating the cooling rate, adjusting the corona block composition, controlling polymer dispersity, and varying solvents. Further innovations involved the use of organic sacrificial templates to produce hollow fiber-basket polymersomes and the application of inorganic substrates for surface micelle growth, yielding organic-inorganic hybrid materials with tailored functionalities. A significant breakthrough was the development of protocols for generating uniform polymeric spherulites and their precursors in solution. Although spherulites are common in bulk polymer materials and materials found in fields such as geology and biology, they have not been observed from block polymers in solution. We uncovered a novel CDSA mechanism in which defects in lamellar precursors act as a critical driver for constructing 3D architectures. To achieve intricate, bioinspired, and uniform 3D structures, further efforts will focus on enhancing structural control and integrating multifunctional properties.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusMetallacycles, derivatives of carbocyclic compounds wherein a metal atom replaces at least one carbon center, have been a constant powerhouse in organic synthesis. While metallacycles of main-group, transition, and actinide metals have been extensively studied, those incorporating rare-earth (RE) elements (Sc, Y, and lanthanides) have remained elusive primarily due to synthetic challenges. Nevertheless, the electropositive character of these elements and the resulting polarization of RE-C bonds, along with the intrinsic synergistic effects within metallacycles, endow RE metallacycles with unique properties and a rich, yet largely untapped, reaction chemistry. In this Account, we present the development and applications of five-membered RE metallacycles.Over the past decade, we have successfully synthesized a variety of five-membered all-carbon rare-earth metallacycles using two key synthetic strategies: (i) transmetalation, which has been employed to prepare RE metallacyclopentadienes and spiro-metallacyclopentadienes, which, featuring various ligand systems, provide distinct coordination environments around the RE center, significantly influencing their reactivity, and (ii) transmetalation and reduction, enabling the synthesis of RE spiro-metallacyclopentenes and 2-butene tetraanion (BTA)-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes. The reduction process proceeds via either self-disproportionation of metallacyclopentadienes or reduction by divalent RE centers or alkali metals. These metallacycles represent the first instances of such RE-containing metallacyclic ring structures.Our investigations into these metallacycles have uncovered unique reactivities and new reaction modes. The high intrinsic reactivity and multiple reactive sites of rare-earth metallacycles enable them not only to activate small molecules efficiently but also to exhibit distinct activation modes for some small molecules. For instance, reactions of RE metallacyclopentadienes with carbodiimides showcase diverse insertion/rearrangement chemistry, influenced by various factors such as number of equivalents of carbodiimide and the solvent choice. The RE metallacyclopentadiene-mediated [3 + 1] fragmentation of white phosphorus demonstrates an activation mode markedly different from that observed with main-group and transition metal analogs. Moreover, the discovery of cross-carbanion coupling at RE centers and RE-metal-mediated ring-opening metathesis of benzene introduces new reaction modes, demonstrating that, with rational design, RE metals can exhibit properties similar to or even surpassing those of transition metals. These reaction modes have further led to the development of applications for RE metallacycles in synthetic chemistry.Additionally, some novel properties of these rare-earth metallacycles have been uncovered, stemming from their unique geometric and electronic structures. Structural analysis and theoretical calculations have revealed the nonplanar aromaticity of BTA-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes, extending the concept of nonplanar aromaticity into the chemistry of carbon-RE metallacycles. Furthermore, benefiting from the redox capabilities of butadiene dianion and BTA ligands, the ligand-based redox chemistry of BTA-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes demonstrates diverse and efficient multielectron transfer processes, highlighting the potential of these metallacycles for redox chemistry.The studies of rare-earth metallacycles, encompassing their construction, characterization, properties, reactivity, and synthetic applications, have greatly enriched the field of f-block metallacycles. We hope that this Account will inspire further exploration into the synthesis of new organometallic reagents and metallacycle-mediated transformations, fueling continued progress in rare-earth chemistry.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn recent years, multicomponent self-assembly has emerged as a pivotal strategy in supramolecular chemistry, enabling the construction of artificial systems with enhanced functionalities that surpass those of individual molecular components. These assemblies have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and biomedical engineering. However, achieving precise control over the assembly process remains a significant challenge, as increased structural complexity often results in thermodynamic mixtures, limiting their practical applications. In this context, metal-coordination-driven multicomponent self-assembly has emerged as a promising strategy, as the moderate strength and good directionality of metal-ligand bonds ensure the formation of discrete supramolecular architectures with well-defined structures and geometries. Notably, the integration of pyridyl and carboxylate donors with cis-Pt(II) nodes offers an effective approach for constructing multicomponent metallacages. This method is particularly attractive due to its ability to enable precise heteroleptic assembly, along with the accessibility and tunability of the ligands, which impart desirable photophysical properties and potential anticancer activities.This Account provides a comprehensive overview of our work on the design, preparation, and functionalization of multicomponent metallacages via the heteroleptic assembly of pyridyl and carboxylate ligands with cis-Pt(II) nodes. By strategically tailoring the ligand structures and adjusting the number of coordination sites, we have successfully constructed multicomponent metallacages with diverse geometries, including tetragonal and hexagonal prisms, triple-cavity ladders, truncated octahedra, and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, etc. In particular, we highlight the use of functional pyridyl ligands, such as tetraphenylethylene, hexaphenylbenzene, perylene diimide, and porphyrin derivatives, to explore the applications of these metallacages. Tetraphenylethylene and hexaphenylbenzene derivatives are propeller-shaped molecules with aggregation-induced emission properties, enhancing the emission of the metallacages both in solution and the solid state. Perylene diimide derivatives, with their electron-deficient, planar conjugated structures, contribute to strong emission in solution, thereby improving the host-guest chemistry and luminescent properties of the metallacages. Porphyrin derivatives, owing to their planar structures and excellent photosensitivity, endow the metallacages with significant photocatalytic capabilities. Additionally, other ligands, such as phenanthroline and triazine derivatives, have been employed to impart antibacterial and SO2 adsorption properties, respectively, to the metallacages. Furthermore, metallacage-cross-linked supramolecular networks exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and superior processability, making them promising candidates for functional materials. At the conclusion of this Account, we address the challenges and future perspectives in the development of multicomponent metallacages. We believe that ongoing research in this field will significantly advance the understanding of metal-coordination chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and the development of functional supramolecular materials.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusUltraviolet (UV) light has traditionally been used to drive photochemical organic transformations, mainly due to the limited visible-light absorption of most organic molecules. However, the high energy associated with UV light often causes undesirable side reactions. In the late 2000s, MacMillan, Yoon, and Stephenson pioneered the use of visible light in conjunction with photocatalysts (PCs) to initiate organic transformations. This innovative approach overcame the limitations of UV light by utilizing visible-light-absorbing PCs in their photoexcited states for electron or energy transfer, generating reactive radical species and promoting the photoreactions. Furthermore, while the photocatalysis has predominantly relied on transition-metal complexes, concerns over the potential toxicity, cost, and sustainability of these metals have driven the development of organic PCs. These organic PCs eliminate the need for metal removal, offer structural diversity, and enable tuning of their properties, thus paving the way for the creation of a tailored library of PCs.In recent decades, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel organic PCs with diverse scaffolds, with a notable example being the work of Zhang et al. in 2016. They demonstrated that cyanoarene analogues, originally developed by Adachi et al. for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in organic light-emitting diodes, could function effectively as PCs. Building on these insights, we developed a PC design platform featuring TADF compounds with twisted donor-acceptor structures, which paved the way for new PC discoveries. We showcased these PCs' ability (i) to generate long-lived lowest triplet excited (T1) states and (ii) to tune redox potentials by independently modifying donor and acceptor moieties. Through this platform, we discovered PCs with varying redox potentials and the capability to effectively populate T1 states, establishing structure-property relationships within our PC library and creating PC selection criteria for targeted reactions. Specifically, we tailored PCs for highly efficient reversible-deactivation radical polymerizations, including organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization, photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, and atom transfer radical polymerization with dual photoredox/copper catalysis as well as rapid free radical polymerizations. These advancements have also facilitated the development of functionalized, visible-light-cured adhesives for advanced display technologies. Furthermore, we investigated the origins of the exceptional catalytic performance of these PCs through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including electrochemical and photophysical measurements, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetics simulations. Specifically, we studied the formation and degradation of key PC intermediates in photocatalytic dehalogenations of alkyl and aryl halides. Our findings revealed a distinctive photodegradation pattern in the cyanoarene-based PCs, which significantly impact their catalytic efficiency in the reaction. Additionally, this discovery led us to introduce a concept of beneficial PC degradation for the first time.Over the past decades, organic photocatalysis based on the T1 state has become central to polymerization and organic synthesis. Utilizing our PC design platform, we have developed novel PCs and catalytic systems that enhance the overall efficiency of various organic transformations. In this overview of our contributions to visible-light-driven organic photocatalysis, we highlight the role of the T1 state in broadening applications through mechanistic analysis, enabling more sustainable transformations.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe challenge of optimizing decentralized water, wastewater, and reuse treatment systems calls for innovative, efficient technologies. One advancement involves surface-modified side-emitting optical fibers (SEOFs), which enhance biochemical and chemical light-driven reactions. SEOFs are thin glass or polymeric optical fibers with functionalized surfaces that can be used individually or bundled together. They can be attached to various light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers, which launch ultraviolet (UV) or visible light into the fibers. This light is then emitted along the fiber's surface, creating irradiance similar to a glow stick. The resulting SEOFs uniquely deliver light energy to complex environments while maximizing photon utilization and minimizing energy loss, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in photolysis and photocatalysis systems. SEOFs generate and leverage refracted light and evanescent waves to achieve continuous irradiation of their cladding, wherein photocatalysts are embedded. This method contrasts with traditional slurry-based systems, where light energy is often scattered or absorbed before reaching the reaction sites. Such scattering typically reduces quantum yields and reaction kinetics. In contrast, SEOFs create a controlled light delivery system that enhances reaction efficiency and adaptability to diverse applications.Important chemical and physical concepts are explored when scaling up SEOFs for three potential engineered applications. The selection of polymer materials and nanoparticle compositions is crucial for optimizing SEOFs as waveguides for visible to UV-C wavelengths and for embedding surface-accessible photocatalysts within porous polymer coatings on SEOF surfaces. Additionally, understanding how light propagates within SEOFs and emits along their exterior surface and length is essential for influencing the quantum yields of chemical products and enhancing biochemical sensitivity to low UV-C exposure. UV-C SEOFs are employed for germicidal disinfection, inactivating biofilms and pathogens in water systems. By overcoming UV light attenuation issues in traditional methods, SEOFs facilitate uniform distribution of UV-C energy, disrupting biofilm formation at early stages. SEOFs enhance UV-A and visible-light photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Embedding photocatalysts in porous polymer cladding enables simultaneous improvements in reaction kinetics and quantum yields. SEOFs enable decentralized light-driven production of clean energy resources such as hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, and formic acid, offering sustainable alternatives for off-grid systems.The design principles of SEOFs emphasize scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. Recent innovations in polymer chemistry, nanoparticle coatings, and surface roughness engineering have further optimized light delivery and side-emission. Tailoring the refractive index and nanoparticle distribution on fiber surfaces ensures precise evanescent wave propagation, enhancing photocatalytic performance. These advancements, coupled with scalable fabrication techniques, have positioned SEOFs as promising platforms for broad photochemical applications.By summarizing recent advances and identifying future needs, this Account positions SEOFs as a transformative approach to light-driven reactions, merging cutting-edge materials science with sustainable water treatment and energy production goals. This emerging technology offers immense potential to reshape photochemical processes for decentralized applications. Despite significant progress, challenges remain. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst loading, improving uniformity in side emissions, and enhancing polymer durability for long-term operational stability. Additionally, scaling SEOF configurations to multifiber bundles and integrating them into decentralized water systems will be critical for broader adoption.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusEnantioselective catalysts that exhibit broad generality are disruptive innovators in contemporary synthesis and are considered to be \"privileged\" on account of their expansive reactivity/selectivity profiles. Operating in the ground state, these species simultaneously regulate reactivity and orchestrate the translation of chiral information with exquisite efficiency: achieving parity in higher-energy (excited-state) scenarios remains a frontier in contemporary catalysis. Advancing this field will require new structure-activation guidelines to be delineated that reflect the energetic realities of achieving chiral induction in non-ground-state environments, thereby expediting the discovery of privileged photocatalysts. Earth-abundant aluminum-salen (Al-salen) complexes, which have a venerable history in ground-state enantioselective catalysis, show great promise in reconciling this disparity on account of their well-defined photophysical properties. In this Account, the potential of these catalysts in engaging various substrates via discrete activation modes to furnish optically enriched products with high levels of reliability is discussed. The deployment of commercial Al-salen complexes in the single electron transfer (SET)-enabled deracemization of cyclopropyl ketones is an exemplar. Irradiation of a commercial Al-salen complex augments the function of the catalyst to enable efficient deracemization (up to 98:2 e.r.), thereby eliminating the need for directing units. In stark contrast to conventional deracemization approaches that are predicated on C(sp3)-H deprotonation/reprotonation sequences, the transformation is characterized by a key C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond cleavage/cyclization process. Subsequent downstream manipulations of the enantioenriched products demonstrate the synthetic utility of the methodology. To illustrate mechanistic diversity using the same Al-salen complex, an enantioselective photocyclization under the auspices of energy transfer (EnT) catalysis is described. The photocyclization of acrylanilides under operationally simple conditions facilitates access to a diverse group of heterocyclic products (up to quantitative yield and 96:4 e.r.) using an Al-salen as the sole chiral operator. Collectively, these mechanistically distinct scenarios illustrate that light activation is a powerful strategy to augment the reactivity arsenal of a ubiquitous small molecule catalyst that is considered to be privileged in the ground state. The mechanistic foundations of reaction development are surveyed (combined experimental and computational approach), together with a perspective on the impact of this enabling technology in chiral functional molecule discovery. This Account serves to emphasize the synthetic utility of leveraging photochemical activation to mitigate intrinsic constraints of processes that might be considered to be thermochemically challenging.",

Among them, lanthanide-containing clusters (LCCs) are particularly notable for their aesthetically pleasing architectures and intriguing properties. Achieving precise synthesis and accurate structural characterization of these clusters is crucial for unlocking their potential applications. Mass spectrometry (MS), particularly electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), has proven to be a powerful tool, providing exceptional sensitivity and clarity in revealing the formation mechanisms and structural details of metal clusters. In this Account, we explore the synthesis, characterization, and assembly mechanisms of LCCs utilizing ESI-MS. We begin by tracing the historical development of LCCs, emphasizing the critical role of single-crystal X-ray diffraction in structural confirmation and the challenges associated with it. We then discuss the application of ESI-MS in characterizing LCCs, highlighting how this technique can monitor the formation processes of LCCs and determine their molecular weights and charge states. We introduce the mass difference fingerprint of isomorphism (MDFI) method, which can facilitate rapid analysis of LCCs' mass spectrometry data. Furthermore, we discuss the state of LCCs in solution and the challenges in their characterization. By utilizing ESI-MS, we enhance the understanding of the assembly mechanisms of LCCs and propose new strategies for designing and synthesizing new LCCs with tailored structures and functions. Looking forward, the ESI-MS method will play increasingly significant roles in LCC research.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As reactive intermediates and substructures of natural products and bioactive molecules, the smallest cyclic alkanes—cyclopropanes—are an attractive class of molecules for chemists. Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations.",

These unnatural enzymes are capable of synthesizing molecules that are either not amenable to biosynthesis or are extremely challenging to access chemically. PKSs can thus be a powerful platform to expand the chemical landscape beyond the limits of conventional metabolic engineering. Here we employ a retrobiosynthesis approach to design and construct PKSs to produce δ-valerolactam (VL) and three enantiopure α-substituted VL analogues that have no known biosynthetic route. We introduce the engineered PKSs and pathways for various malonyl-CoA derivatives into Pseudomonas putida and use proteomics, metabolomics and culture condition optimization to improve the production of our target compounds. These α-substituted VLs are polymerized into polyamides (nylon-5) or converted into their N-acryloyl derivatives. RAFT polymerization produces bio-derived polymers with potential biomedical applications. Overall, this interdisciplinary effort highlights the versatility and effectiveness of a PKS-based retrobiosynthesis approach in exploring and developing innovative biomaterials.",

Here we report efficient regioselective catalytic methods for the formation of benzyltrimethylsilanes through ruthenium-catalysed C(sp\n            2)–H silylmethylation. The developed protocols enable selective functionalization at both ortho and meta positions within arenes bearing N-based directing groups. The resulting silylmethyl compounds can undergo diverse transformations, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution, carbonyl addition, olefination and desilylation. Significantly, the regiodivergent installation of silylmethyl synthetic handles allows for the synthesis of the pharmaceutical losmapimod and could further be applied in direct late-stage functionalizations. Mechanistically, an essential role for biscyclometallated ruthenium(II) species has been found, with the formation of intermediate ruthenium(III) species indicated by paramagnetic NMR experiments. These synthetic inventions and mechanistic elucidations signify a transformative step within ruthenium-catalysed C(sp\n            2)–H functionalization, enabling diverse syntheses and providing a framework for future development.",

    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution of self-replicating entities most likely played a key role in the emergence of life from inanimate matter. For evolution to occur, self-replicators must (1) have structural space accessible to them, (2) occupy only part of it at any time, and (3) navigate it through mutation and selection. We describe a system of self-replicating hexameric macrocycles formed upon the mixing of two building blocks and occupying a subset of possible sequences. Specific interactions, most likely through steric zipper formation, favor a hexamer sequence where the two blocks alternate. Under different replication-destruction regimes, distinct replicator mutants are selected. With non-selective destruction (via outflow), the fastest replicators dominate. With chemically mediated, selective destruction, a mutant that balances replication speed and resistance to reduction by steric zipper formation becomes dominant. This system demonstrates a rudimentary form of Darwinian evolution, where replicators adapt to changing selection pressures through mutation and selection.",

Non‐flammable phosphate electrolytes are competent to address this issue, yet current designs struggle to balance the interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity due to the untamed interaction between Na+ and anion. Herein, we evaluate the effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on this interaction, revealing a systematic approach to achieve desired designs. It is shown that incorporating solvents with high DC and moderate Ea forms anion‐rich solvation structure for stabilizing the anode interface and achieving necessary salt dissociation for high ionic conductivity. Specifically, propylene carbonate is incorporated as the eligible solvent into triethyl phosphate, affording non‐flammable electrolytes with low cost and high ionic conductivity of 6.22 mS cm−1. Consequently, 1.25 Ah hard carbon (HC)|NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) pouch cell delivers a high‐power discharge of 5C rate and maintains an impressive capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, 6.61 Ah HC|NFM pouch cell with 152.3 Wh kg−1 avoids smoke production and volume expansion during nail penetration. This work discloses an advanced strategy for deigning practical phosphate electrolytes, paving the way for developing high‐performance SIBs.",

Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant‐induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer route, generating surface‐bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low‐valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe‐Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst‐phenol interaction towards self‐activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14‐time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order‐of‐magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100‐day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst‐pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.",

However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, break from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain‐branched dual‐ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3 mW cm‐2. In‐situ ultraviolet‐visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual‐ammonium structure accelerates ~40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high‐energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco‐friendliness, durability, and sustainability.",

However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid‐assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered‐spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered‐spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1 C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26 mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi‐strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMelanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane‐bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell‐SELEX and cell‐internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT‐1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT‐1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT‐1e, we engineered an aptamer‐based molecular tethering agent TTe‐TTe. We found that TTe‐TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe‐TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm‐shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C═O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single‐atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p‐xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO‐66‐NH2‐A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr‐oxo nodes of UiO‐66‐NH2 to form Cu–O–Zr sites. The Cu–O–Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro‐deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36 h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu–O–Zr sites also drives the reaction process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO‐aminophenol oxidases, a specialized subclass of type‐III copper proteins, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive nitrosophenols, which display antiretroviral and blood cholesterol‐lowering activity. Another related subclass of type‐III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o‐aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o‐aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o‐aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso‐forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL‐24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso‐forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso‐forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o‐aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.",

In this work, we introduce a center‐chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to overcome this limitation. By integrating a stereogenic carbon center into a fluorene scaffold, we create a unique interaction between a boron‐based multi‐resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) Lewis acid and an arylamine Lewis base. This sterically hindered design prevents strong charge transfer while optimizing the alignment between electric and magnetic dipole moments for amplified CPL signals. Our OLEDs achieve impressive electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) of 6.64 × 10−3, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 30.4%, and sub‐30 nm spectral linewidths. These improvements yield a Figure of Merit (FoM = EQE × |gEL|) of 1.91 × 10−3, the highest reported for center‐chiral CPL devices.

These compounds leverage the unique electronic properties of the B←N motif, enabling the development of two new n‐type polymers, PBTBN and PFBTBN. Notably, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBTBN and PFBTBN are significantly lowered by 0.2–0.3 eV compared to their counterparts without B←N functionalization, with PFBTBN achieving a LUMO of ∼ −4.0 eV. Importantly, PFBTBN exhibits exceptional unipolar n‐type transistor performance with a high electron mobility (µe) of 3.85 cm2 V−1 s−1. The asymmetric half‐fused B←N molecular backbone not only stabilizes the electronic structure but also induces a near‐amorphous morphology, thereby enabling PFBTBN‐based flexible transistors to retain a high µe of 3.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 even after 1000 bending cycles. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of incorporating asymmetric B←N functionalized acceptors for high‐performance n‐type semiconducting polymers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3‐butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy‐intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure–performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu‐MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as‐designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3‐MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C–C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3‐butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3‐butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3‐MOF affords a 1,3‐butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3‐butadiene production rate of 64 mmol g−1 h−1, which is about 2‐fold and 20‐fold higher than Cu2‐MOF and Cu1‐MOF. This work not only provides profound insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of acetylene hydrodimerization but also guides the rational design of high‐activity electrocatalysts.",

Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways leading from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C─C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO to form CH2CO, identified as the rate‐determining step in the formation of C2+ products. These findings deepen the understanding of the C─C coupling processes, which are crucial for advancing catalyst development in electrochemical CO2 upgrading.",

Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen‐deficient TiO2 under an air‐level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31 mg gcat−1 h−1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen‐free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to •NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen‐derived O2•–. This •NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air‐level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to •NH2 while preventing over‐oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSuppressing the defects from SnO2 and perovskite interface is essential for the fabrication of large‐area n–i–p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the needed lifetime and efficiency for commercialization. Here, we report the employment of l‐citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (─COOH, ─NH2) and urea (─NH─CO─NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I−. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain‐size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive δ phase to result in suppressed trap‐assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent‐free slot‐die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.",

However, the structural and interfacial instability of high‐voltage LiCoO2 is exacerbated when the charging cut‐off voltage exceeds 4.55 V, resulting in severe mechanical failure and subsequent dramatic capacity decay. Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co‐containing Li‐rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high‐voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice‐coherent Li‐rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high‐voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li‐rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6 V and even at 4.7 V. This work taps into a new avenue of surface engineering on high‐voltage LiCoO2.",

Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron‐affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose‐dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene‐functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2‐Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4‐nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia‐selective toxicity arises from reductase‐mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2‐Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen‐mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster‐based hypoxic radiosensitizers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRechargeable zinc metal batteries (RZMBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high capacity and cost‐effectiveness. However, their commercialization is hindered by challenges including dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation, particularly under low current densities and negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratios. Localized high‐concentration electrolytes offer potential solutions, but their reliance on high salt concentrations to replicate solvation structures of high‐concentration electrolytes limits their practicality, due to diluent's inherent inertness that limits its role in interfacial chemistry. Here, we present a co‐regulation strategy that integrates bulk and interfacial properties to develop an interfacial‐enhanced localized high‐concentration electrolyte (ILHCE). By incorporating non‐coordinating 1,4‐dioxane diluent and 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium (emim+) cations into dilute aqueous electrolytes, dioxane molecules are pulled into electric double layer (EDL) through the interaction between emim+ and dioxane, achieving a pronounced dilution effect from bulk electrolyte to the EDL. This generates an anion‐rich and water‐depleted EDL at both anode and cathode interfaces, enhancing Zn2+ transport dynamics, ensuring cathode stability and deriving a robust anion‐derived solid‐electrolyte interphase. Full batteries using Mn0.5V6O13 cathodes with a low N/P ratio of 1.77 demonstrate 80% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, highlighting ILHCE as a transformative electrolyte design toward real‐world applications.",

The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46 A mgPd−1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12 A mgPd−1) and Pt/C (0.17 A mgPt−1).

Experimental and Density Functional Theory calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd–Co–P interfaces could direct the two‐dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film‐like Li2O2 products.

However, current SSEs still face challenges of balancing stability and ionic conductivity, which limits their practical applications in solid‐state Li batteries. Here, we report a general strategy for achieving high‐performance SSEs by constructing a Li+‐conducted polymeric metal–organic nanocapsule (PolyMONC(Li)) network through molecular design. With the unique cage structure and pore size, metal–organic nanocapsule (MONC) can achieve excellent anion confinement effects. The PolyMONC(Li) network with continuous Li+ conduction pathways serves as a solid electrolyte exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (0.18 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.83). Combining the two superiorities of optimal balance between mechanical strength and excellent Li+ conductivity, the PolyMONC(Li) can still restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short‐circuiting even over 900 h cycling. The PolyMONC(Li)‐based SSEs Li‐metal batteries achieved a higher specific capacity than common polymer electrolytes such as polyethylene oxide‐based SSE. Additionally, taking advantage of the PolyMONC(Li) electrode binder, the solid‐state Li–O2 battery achieves a stable cycling over 400 cycles.

This disparity is primarily attributed to the sulfur atom's inherent nucleophilicity and high susceptibility to oxidation. Here we present a conceptually distinct photocatalytic strategy that enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes, furnishing previously inaccessible cyclic thioborane scaffolds and synthetically valuable alkyl boronates in an efficient manner.

Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent with kinetic‐isotope‐effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to  eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom.

    "abstract": "AbstractSortase‐mediated transpeptidation is a powerful biochemical reaction to perform protein engineering. In this work, we leverage the unique electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA‐5M) to improve SrtA‐5M‐mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. Importantly, the reaction proceeds with a minimal excess of nucleophile and is fast and highly efficient in the low micromolar substrate concentration range. Electrostatic assistance eliminates the need for additives or complex substrate engineering strategies, thereby giving it a broad scope. Our findings also provide fundamental insights into the influence of substrate charge on SrtA‐5M activity, paving the way for further optimization of sortase A‐catalyzed transpeptidation reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHeteroatom‐doped single‐atom nanozymes (SAEs) hold great promise as enzyme mimics, yet their catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single‐atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S‐FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)‐like activity. Synthesized via low‐temperature carbonization, S‐FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC‐STEM. The POD‐specific activity of S‐FeCDs reached 295 U mg−1, which is 11.2‐fold higher than that of sulfur‐free FeCDs, with natural enzyme‐like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the ΔG for H2O2‐to‐·OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate‐determining step (2*OH → *O + *H2O) from 2.50 to 1.62 eV. In vivo, S‐FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA‐infected wound models, achieving near‐complete healing within 7 days. The proton driving mechanism was further validated through nitro compound reduction, demonstrating accelerated N─H bond activation. This work highlights the critical role of sulfur‐induced proton dynamics in enhancing SAEs performance, providing a rational strategy for designing multifunctional nanozymes in biomedical and catalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConjugated radical polymers (RPs) with polyradical structures in an π‐conjugated polymeric backbone have the potential to serve as both model molecules for spin‐correlated condensed matters and as materials for optoelectronics and spin‐based quantum applications. However, preparing RPs of this type with high stability and spin‐delocalized nature presents a significant challenge. We report herein two ambient‐stable conjugated RPs (RPH and RPC), synthetically obtained by an unprecedented straightforward copolymerization of two brominated diradical monomers (diradical characters up to 0.88) with bis‐stannylated DPP units. Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open‐shell ground state, the diradical‐derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin‐delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of S = 1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near‐infrared absorptions beyond 1000 nm, multi‐stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing π‐paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin‐film state RPH exhibited superior ambipolar carrier‐transporting properties with well‐balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as attractive room‐temperature quantum coherence times (T1 = 1.88 µs, T2 = 218 ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations. This study introduces a facile approach for constructing stable conjugated RPs, along with their integrated electronic and spin properties.",

Herein, we investigate the crystallization of the amino acid L‐Cysteine and show that both the structure of the crystal and its intrinsic fluorescence can be drastically altered by the solvent. Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (dDNP) is a powerful hyperpolarization technique enabling sensitivity gains beyond 4 orders of magnitude in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Over the last decades, researchers' efforts have led to an extension of dDNP applications in numerous research fields. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widespread types of rechargeable batteries, which calls for a deeper understanding of the various physicochemical mechanisms involved in making them more efficient, safe, and sustainable. One of the key challenges lies in better understanding the degradation of the battery electrolyte to mitigate it, as it can significantly impact the battery's performance. While NMR has been used in attempts to understand these mechanisms, notably by investigating the degradation products, the intrinsic lack of sensitivity of this technique, combined with the limited accessible volume of such compounds, makes its application often challenging. In this work, we combine several state-of-the-art dDNP methodologies, including the use of recently introduced hyperpolarizing polymers (HYPOPs), to acquire hyperpolarized 13C NMR spectra of battery electrolytes. We show that we can successfully detect 13C signals on formulated battery electrolyte solutions in different degradation stages on a 600 MHz spectrometer, with sensitivity gains of up to 3 orders of magnitude. This work paves the way for studying lithium-ion battery electrolyte degradation under real usage conditions (cycling, thermal aging, air exposure, etc.) with a 13C detection limit below the micromolar range. This methodology has the potential to provide new insights into degradation mechanisms and the role and effectiveness of additives to mitigate electrolyte degradation.",

    "abstract": "Rationally designing nanostructures and comprehensively understanding the structure-property relationships are important for directional charge transfer. A general dual-interface built-in electric field (BIEF) regulation strategy is developed to synthesize the bifunctional ZnS/Sv-chalcogenide/Ti3C2 heterostructure photocatalysts (Sv represents sulfur vacancies; chalcogenides include ZnIn2S4, CdS, and CdIn2S4) consisting of a ZnS/chalcogenide S-scheme heterojunction and a Sv-chalcogenide/Ti3C2 Schottky heterojunction. The ternary-component photocatalyst construction involves hollow core-shell heterostructure establishment via lateral epitaxy and chalcogenide-surface Ti3C2 nanoparticle introduction via a defect-mediated heterocomponent anchorage. These nanoreactors integrate the strong intrinsic driving force and enhanced interfacial electronic coupling, leveraging resulting dual-interface BIEFs for precise carrier mobility control and robust redox performance feedback. The BIEF-induced ultrafast charge transfer features powerful photocarrier enrichment and feeble photocarrier recombination at the ZnS/ZnIn2S4 S-scheme heterointerface as well as continuous steering of photocarrier localization and delocalized electron transport at the Sv-ZnIn2S4/Ti3C2 Schottky heterointerface. Simultaneously, BIEF-induced targeted molecule catalysis is marked by complementary adsorption and selective activation of key intermediates. Representative ZnS/Sv-ZnIn2S4/Ti3C2 demonstrates broad substrate compatibility and superhigh reactivity in cooperative biomass valorization and hydrogen evolution. This study provides a programmable framework for manipulating BIEFs by multicomponent ordered-space integration and interface engineering, elucidating the substantial impact of dual-interface BIEFs on carrier transport behavior and molecular catalytic behavior.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS) are expected to produce groundbreaking technologies in computing, sensing, and communications. These developments could have an impact on the economy and workforce of the United States. In order to achieve this vision and sustain U.S. leadership in QIS, however, a robust research enterprise needs to be established. Presently, QIS has reached an inflection point for new discoveries; searching for novel quantum molecular materials that are operational, practical, and efficient is now the new frontier. Since chemistry is the study of manipulating molecular properties across different lengths and time-scales, it has a tremendous opportunity to take a leading role in this untapped domain. Blending QIS and chemistry together will accelerate progress in designing new quantum molecular materials, developing novel measurement tools and techniques, and establishing new quantum computing standards. A recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report, Advancing Chemistry and Quantum Information Science, points to fundamental research areas at the interface of these two disciplines that should be pursued in the near-term. Here, a brief overview of these research directions as well as collaboration and infrastructure needs identified from the report are presented.",

This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly‐SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly‐SS features linear disulfide‐containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly‐SS demonstrates the exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2‐diketones, achieving >99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly‐SS, enabling facile thin‐film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide‐linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.",

This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light‐driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light‐driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric‐driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light‐induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light‐driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.",

This Concept article describes strategy‐level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site‐selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group.

The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d‐d transitions and possible metal‐to‐metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared (NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV–cut off (85–90%), which indicates possible use as UV‐NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3–5 times higher than KDP. The dielectric studies indicated reasonable values for the dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long‐term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations, which support the findings of the experimental investigations. The present study clearly indicates that it is profitable to explore mineral structures as hosts toward new colored compounds, substitution of transition elements that result not only in new and also for application as electrocatalysts through careful band engineering.",

Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2‐symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five‐fold enhancement of the g‐factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine‐tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high‐performance chiroptical materials.",

The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P═Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The novel phosphaketene compounds (IDipp)Au(PCO) (IDipp = 1,3‐bis(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)imidazol‐2‐ylidene) and (DippNacNac)Zn(PCO) (DippNacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6‐iPr2C6H3) can be synthesized by reaction of Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} with Au(IDipp)Cl or (DippNacNac)ZnCl·LiCl(OEt2)2, respectively. In the case of the former, the released stannylene Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 ultimately inserts into the Au─PCO bond, affording the tin(IV) complex (IDipp)AuSn(PCO)[CH(SiMe3)2]2.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of efficient, nontoxic, and low‐cost nano‐antioxidants has attracted extensive attention in food preservation but still remains a great challenge in materials design and mechanism exploration. Herein, novel reductive carbon dots (r‐CDs) were successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that r‐CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r‐CDs exhibit remarkable preservation effects on apples and strawberries and significantly extend their shelf‐life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon‐core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process. More interestingly, the reducibility of r‐CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N‐doped CDs (N‐CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material‐controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development of non‐toxic, efficient carbon nano‐antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material‐controlled synthesis.",

Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid‐treated conditions, and also allows real‐time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER. This work not only provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamic interactions between LDs and ER but also highlights a strategy for designing dual‐organelle‐targeted fluorescent probes.",

Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the “best” reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning models. In addition, comparing the machine learning models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi‐catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.",

All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, UV–Visible (UV‐Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF‐7. Wound healing assays were conducted to assess cytotoxicity and cell migration under QD treatment. Results showed that both coated and uncoated QDs influenced wound closure rates in a concentration‐ and time‐dependent manner. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed significant green luminescence of CdSe:Eu quantum dots (QDs) in both HaCaT and MCF‐7 cell lines, indicating efficient cellular uptake. The internalization of QDs was influenced by their surface properties and charge, suggesting an endocytic uptake pathway.",

The size of the cavity and the position of the P2Ni fragment relative to the cavity affect both the activity and selectivity of the reaction. In all instances, 1‐butene is the major product (up to 98% C4 products and 90% 1‐butene within the C4 fraction).

While C does not show any reactivity, the cationic complexes A and B undergo addition reactions. The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(η3‐P4R2L)]+ (1a – d) and [Cp'''Ni(η1:1‐P4R2L)]+ (3a – d) show different geometries for the L‐P3PR2 ligands. Their reactivity towards EtO– results in either a simple addition (for 1) or a complex addition, ring‐opening, rearrangement sequence (for 3). Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(η2‐IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by the reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso‐tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies shed light upon the fundamental principles, which differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}– transition metal units. Lastly, 3a–d were chosen as model substrates for further nucleophilic functionalization.

Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene‐linked COFs termed g‐TDM‐COF and g‐TBD‐COF, respectively.  The methoxyl substituents pended on the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over 8‐fold enhancement of photocatalytic H2O2 production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500 nm. Such phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen‐bond interaction, thus favorable for broading light‐harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity, As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.",

Developing rapid, sensitive and specific in situ virus detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)‐based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN‐based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV‐RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV‐RNA within 12 min in a cell‐free environment, enabling real‐time imaging of JEV‐RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments.

    "abstract": "In this work, a series of Shell‐by‐Shell (SbS)‐functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6 nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2‐PACX@SDBS (X = 3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first‐shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chain.",

    "abstract": "With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point‐of‐care biosensors, two‐dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real‐time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities, enhancing the understanding of human biosystem. Since they are cost‐effective and user‐friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors.  Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area, tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhances their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focussing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in‐depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute towards enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti‐counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low‐molecular‐weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent‐colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf‐like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via π‐electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBoron‐doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high‐performance organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron‐oxygen (B─O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom‐doped molecule, BNB‐OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation‐directed, lithium‐free methodology, achieving an impressive one‐pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB‐OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi‐planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long‐range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB‐OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B─O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom‐doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH‐based blue‐light OLED applications.",

    "abstract": "The controlled chemical synthesis of Aluminum nanocrystals (Al NCs) is crucial for their applications in plasmonics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N‐methylpyrrolidine (AlH3·(NMP)x) and the Al NC synthesis outcomes . Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3·(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3·(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3·(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of H3Al·(NMP)1.0 through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. Importantly, H3Al·(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well‐defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased polydispersity and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.",

This strategy provides efficient access to diverse trifluoromethyl-substituted dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[c]quinolines under mild, transition-metal-free conditions. Notably, the sulfoxonium ylide generation and subsequent cyclopropanation could proceed in a one-pot fashion, affording the products in good yields.",

    "abstract": "The cyclopropene scaffold has emerged as a valuable platform in modern synthesis. Here, we present a streamlined flow-based approach for the generation of cyclopropenyllithium and its functionalization with various electrophiles in a single, continuous flow process. This method eliminates the need for laborious temperature changes and cryogenic conditions, and significantly reduces the process time from starting material to products. Compared to traditional batch processes, our flow approach enables the use of a single organolithium reagent and operates efficiently at 0 °C, avoiding the cool-warm-cool temperature cycles typical of batch methods. This not only simplifies the workflow but also enhances practicality, scalability, and extends the accessible chemical space.",

It involves a one-pot sequential multicomponent reaction, which was carried out in two different approaches (with and without purification of 5-aminoisoxazole). The method forms five chemical bonds and offers advantages such as easy product purification, availability of raw materials, high reaction efficiency, and environmental friendliness.

The commonly employed hydroboration-oxidation sequence for the synthesis of terminal alcohols is challenging for allylic alcohols, and O-protection of the alcohol can be necessary. To increase atom economy, we explored the use of silane protecting groups that can be engaged in intramolecular hydrosilylation. Oxidative cleavage of the cyclized product yields the desired 1,3-diol and obviates the need for super-stoichiometric borane reagents. Based on a detailed study of O-silylation conditions, a protocol is presented that furnishes quantitative yields of a wide range of O-silylated alcohols which contain Si–H bonds for further functionalization. We show that a MOF-based Rh(II) porphyrin can furnish efficient intramolecular hydrosilylation while the corresponding homogeneous analogue proved unreactive. Radical trapping studies suggest that silyl radicals constitute key intermediates in Rh(II) catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation. Preferential 5-endo-trig versus 6-exo-trig cyclization and 5-exo-trig versus 6-endo-trig cyclization of the silyl radical intermediates led to chemoselective 1,3-diol formation for substrates containing multiple olefins.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFerrocene, a highly redox-stable organometallic compound with a distinctive sandwich-like structure, has significantly influenced the fields of electrochemistry, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. Modifying the ferrocene core and its side chains is crucial for fine-tuning its redox properties, solubility, and stability, thereby enhancing its performance in various applications. This review discusses the synthesis of ferrocene compounds potentially relevant to electrochemical applications, focusing on recent strategies for nondirected C–H functionalization of the ferrocene core and diverse reactions for side-chain modifications. Advances in C–H activation of ferrocenes have been facilitated by catalytic methods utilizing Pd, Ir, Au, In, and Fe catalysts, as well as through photoredox and electrochemical techniques. Furthermore, side chains are modified via a range of mild transformations compatible with the ferrocene core, including substitution and annulation. These advancements in synthesizing ferrocene derivatives have broadened their potential applications, notably as electron-transfer mediators, energy-storage systems, and sensors.1 \tIntroduction2 \tNondirected C–H Activation of Ferrocene and Its Derivatives3 \tSide-Chain Modification of Ferrocene Derivatives4 \tApplications of Ferrocene Derivatives in Electrochemistry5 \tConclusion",

Here an improved kilogram scale synthesis of Abiraterone is presented, starting from commercially available dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by employing Quality by Design (QbD) principles, statistical design of experiments (DoE), and green metrics parameters to evaluate the environmental impact and efficiency. This article focuses on identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs), exploring the relationship between CQAs and material attributes (MAs), and determining the critical process parameters (CPPs) for synthesizing hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediates, and the final product, Abiraterone acetate. The presented approach effectively managed critical impurities and achieved impressive yields of 98, 84, and 78% with purity >99% in the hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediate, and final API, respectively. The improved synthesis was optimized and scaled for multi-kilogram batches, addressing challenges from previous methods and yielding ICH quality material in 65% overall yield.",

One industrial application for HAT can be found in the tertiary benzylic C–H bond of cumene for producing phenol, a versatile chemical feedstock for various industries. However, the overall phenol yield remains low using the existing Hock process due to the poor selectivity towards the key reaction intermediate, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for phenol production through photooxidation of cumene to CHP using iron bromide under blue light irradiation, where bromine radicals (generated in situ via ligand-to-metal charge transfer) are used as hydrogen atom abstractors. Mechanistic studies revealed the cumene-to-CHP conversion occurred via a tertiary C–H bond abstraction by a radical mechanism, and the acetic acid and water additives increased CHP selectivity through stabilizing peroxides. The cumene-phenol process achieved up to 88% yield of CHP in 1 hour and could be used with a wide range of substrates. We thus developed a selective, mild, and efficient phenol production method using iron bromide under photooxidative conditions.",

However, the gaseous nature of these reagents, along with their intrinsic inertness due to their high bond-dissociation energies (99-105 kcal·mol-1), have rendered traditional strategies ineffective or lacking in selectivity. The use of flow chemistry technology, nonetheless, has made a tremendous impact in this field, improving the efficiency of multiphasic processes through improved mass transfer and larger interfacial areas. In this work, we report a new flow chemistry platform for the photocatalytic hydroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkenes with both isobutane and n-butane.

Originally reported in a racemic fashion by Molander and Doyle, this transformation was re-examined using chiral bis(oxazoline) ligands, revealing distinct enantioselectivity trends depending on the halogen present in the aryl halide and Ni pre-catalyst. Stoichiometric experiments demonstrated that the Ni(II) oxidative addition complex is primarily responsible for trapping the THF radical, while multivariate linear regression modeling confirmed that the halide remains coordinated during the enantiodetermining step. Time-course experiments uncovered an alternative initial pathway when Ni(0) was used as the pre-catalyst, which ultimately converged to the main Ni(II) pathway. EPR analysis further revealed rapid comproportionation between Ni(0) and Ni(II), forming Ni(I) species that engage in radical trapping at early stages, accounting for the observed reactivity differences. By integrating enantioselectivity data with experimental techniques such as EPR spectroscopy, this study establishes enantioinduction analysis as a powerful tool for mechanistic investigations in Ni photochemical catalysis. The insights gained not only refine our understanding of this transformation, but also provide a framework for probing similar Ni/Ir dual photocatalytic systems.1 \tIntroduction2 \tEnantioselectivity Data Highlights a Complex Mechanistic Scenario3 \tProbing the Predominant Pathway with Stoichiometric Experiments4 \tMLR Modeling to Understand the Halogen Effect on the Enantioinduction5 \tProposed Prevalent Mechanism6 \tInitiation with Ni(0) Precatalyst7 \tConclusion",

    "abstract": "Organic radicals with light-emitting properties and exceptional stability offer exciting opportunities to address spin-statistical limitations in organic electronics and advance quantum technologies. These radicals, acting as small molecular magnets, exhibit sensitivity to minute magnetic fields and can be tailored with diverse spin centers, making them ideal for spin-optical interfaces, representing key components in quantum communication systems. Furthermore, their ability to form organized, higher-dimensional assemblies presents a promising avenue for overcoming scalability challenges in quantum technologies. Despite their potential, achieving high luminescence quantum yields has largely been limited to donor-functionalized monoradicals, and a detailed understanding of the luminescent behavior of open-shell organic molecules remains elusive. This review delves into the photoluminescent properties and spin ground states of trityl-based mono-, di-, and multiradicals, examining the strategies employed to enhance their performance. Additionally, we review predictive methods for determining the luminescence and spin states of radicals, highlighting critical unresolved questions that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of trityl-based radicals in advanced technological applications.",

Using detailed NMR studies, the NMR signals have been assigned for both the base and its dihydrochloride salt for further confirming their structures. A new synthesis of the related alkaloid brevicolline was also attempted from the same intermediate. However, after successful coupling of β-carboline with N-methylpyrrole, the trials to saturate the pyrrole ring under various conditions led to unexpected reactions: reduction of ring A of the β-carboline skeleton or trifluoroethylation of the pyrrole moiety occurred, leading to interesting and potentially useful derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of donor–acceptor (D–A) type molecules in the field of materials science, they have found great applicability in the field of photocatalysis. Most of these compounds are based on complex D–A–D structures or multi-D–A systems, such as 4CzIPN. Whereas these systems have been widely studied and applied as photocatalysts, simpler D–A structures remain less explored. Nevertheless, the simplicity of D–A structures makes them the ideal structures to further understand the structure–property relationship of D–A molecules for optimizing their photocatalytic performance by simpler modification of the different D–A subunits. In particular, D–A structures featuring sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors have gained increasing attention for their use as photoredox catalysts. This study introduces a new family of D–A molecules by exploring various sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors, including a novel tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) unit and 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine (IMD). Our findings demonstrate that these simple D–A structures exhibit promising photocatalytic properties, comparable to those of more complex D–A–D systems.",

In recent years, controllable/divergent synthetic strategies for organic functional molecules using common starting materials have garnered significant attention due to their high efficiency. This review categorizes recent literatures focusing on key regulatory factors for product divergent formation, in which controlling chemical selectivity primarily relies on ligands, metal catalysts, solvents, time, temperature, acids/bases, and subtle modifications of substrates. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying reaction activity and selectivity differentiation, the review provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms of critical steps through specific case studies. It is hoped that the controllable/divergent synthesis concept will spark the interest of practitioners and aficionados to delve deeper into the discipline and pursue novel advancements in the realm of chemical synthesis.",

We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance. We suggest first steps that researchers can take to move towards a positive culture of data sharing in organic chemistry. Routine actions that we encourage as standard practice include deposition of raw and metadata to open repositories, and inclusion of machine-readable structure identifiers for all reported compounds.",

Remarkably, Cs3PO4 exhibits the highest extraction efficiency, driven by strong cooperative interactions involving ion-dipole coordination between Cs+ and carbonyl (C=O) groups, as well as direct ion-pairing interactions between 18-crown-6-complexed Cs+ and hexaurea-bound PO43−.

    "abstract": "Pyrrolidine-2,3-diones are important intermediates in the synthesis of numerous nitrogen-containing heterocycles which possess a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities. In this article, we report the synthesis of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,3-diones via a reversible transimination reaction between Schiff’ base (C=N) linkage-containing pyrrolidine-2,3-dione derivatives and methylamine with yields of 80 to 92%. In addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-diphenylpyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5a) was also verified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized molecules were evaluated for compliance with established drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, Egan, and Muegge), as well as ADMET properties. All compounds satisfied these criteria, indicating favorable oral bioavailability. Molecular docking analysis showed that compounds 5a–e act as ligands for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), especially with Cys200 and Ser242 via hydrogen bonds. In addition, van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the ligand–iNOS complexes. In particular, 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-5-phenyl-1-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5e) exhibited the strongest binding affinity (−9.51 kcal/mol) and demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production, with an IC50 value of 43.69 ± 5.26 µM. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (-NO2 group) on the benzene ring at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine-2,3-dione subunit in compound 5e may be responsible for the observed high inhibition activity due to the enhancement and optimization of hydrogen bonding with Cys200. These results underscore the potential of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidenepyrrolidine-2,3-diones, especially compound 5e, as promising scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting iNOS-related pathologies.",

A full catalytic cycle for the enantioselective synthesis of α-hydrazinonitriles is proposed based on insights gained from DFT calculations. Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) has been used as a sacrificial cyanide source. We found that isocyanide (rather than cyanide) is a preferred coordination to calcium during the catalytic cycle, while the active catalyst prefers a side-on coordination of cyanide. The configuration-determining step is a hydrocyanation via a calcium isocyanide complex, whereas the rate-limiting step is that which recovers the calcium catalyst and replaces the TMS-bound product from the catalyst. While our experimental data demonstrate enantioselectivity values as high as 89% under certain conditions, the overall enantioselectivity achieved with the calcium catalyst remains modest, mainly due to competing pathways for the Z- and E-hydrazone isomers leading to opposite enantiomers. The experimental results confirm these computational proposals.",

The key steps are the cross‐conjugated dienone reactivity neutralization by reduction and methylene lactone protection with morpholine or imidazole. Selective saponification of the isobutyrate is also achieved with crude pig liver esterase, leading to tagitinol C in moderate yield. Heliangine from the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and hydroxylated derivatives of tagitinin C from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), two abundant field crops, constitute alternative sources of germacranolide derivatives not accessible from tagitinin C.

Herein, the first two‐step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase‐catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16 h using eco‐friendly t‐amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4 h while keeping the same final yield.

    "abstract": "Both UV‐light‐promoted and organic‐dye‐catalyzed visible light‐promoted reactions of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with an iodine substituent at both ends and substituted anilines are attempted. In the reactions with 1,6‐ and 1,8‐diiodoperfluoroalkanes in the presence of an excess amount of aniline, both ends of the iodide reacts to give a diamine, and the reaction with an excess amount of diiodide gives a monoiodide, in which one end of the diiodide has reacted with the aniline. In contrast, in the case of the 1,4‐diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron‐rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of a fluorine into aliphatic substituents of lead candidates can impart unique structural characteristics that allow fine tuning of drug interactions; therefore, mild, specific or late‐stage fluorination procedures are of growing interest in medicinal chemistry, with the potential to be applied in F‐18 radiochemistry. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of “reagent‐less” electrochemical fluorination leading to mono‐ and gem‐difluorinated proline cores featured in important fibroblast‐activating protein inhibitors. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate activator substituents for allowing the process, the impact of different reaction parameters, and characterizes the various byproducts that are generated in the reaction. We have tested the reaction using a commercially available batch system and flow apparatus, achieving maximum yields of >90% (batch) for mono‐ and of 6% (batch) and 9% (flow) for the gem‐difluorinated proline model. These proof‐of‐concept results indicate that the flow approach is more efficient, but that different activating substituents will be needed to achieve higher yields",

While (H)TPQs are typically non‐emissive and potentially open‐shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the π‐conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium‐containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena‐hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO‐LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia‐analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) and thiaradialene (1.58 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low‐lying LUMO energy levels.",

The use of cage‐shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3‐pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre‐activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3‐pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3‐pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre‐activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4‐disubstituted 3‐pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3‐pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations.",

Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh3, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by‐product from alkyne.

Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single‐carbon‐atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five‐membered carbon‐ and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six‐membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven‐membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo‐ and electro‐catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single‐carbon‐atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology.",

Nevertheless, thermal activation remains mandatory in most cases, which may decrease the compatibility with sensitive functional groups. In this context, improvements of conventional strategies must be an important source of research in order to enhance the applicability of such methods for building complex scaffolds. In this work, we contribute to this aim by implying visible‐light as the sole energy source in a Pd‐catalyzed rearrangement reaction involving N‐tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. These mild reaction conditions efficiently allow oxidative addition, aryl migration and β‐hydride elimination at room temperature, allowing the construction of various 1,1’ disubstituted olefins.",

The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerating various groups such as ethers, sulfides and halogens, and delivers high yields under mild conditions, even at gram scale. The resulting Bpin‐functionalized naphthalenes serve as versatile building blocks, facilitating further transformations of the C−B bond into C−H, C−C, C−I, C−O, and C−N bonds, thereby increasing molecular complexity and enabling the design of more functionalized products. Notably, this sustainable and straightforward protocol selectively introduces the Bpin group at the sterically hindered α‐carbon of the naphthalene framework, complementing C–H borylations of the naphthalene core, that preferentially occur at the β‐position. As a result, the developed approach significantly broadens the accessibility of B‐functionalized naphthalene derivatives for synthetic and application‐oriented purposes.",

In this review, we summarize the coupling reactions of three types of α,β‐unsaturated ketoximes with various organic compounds containing unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles and so on over the past decades. The reaction conditions, selected examples of the reaction scope, limitations, and reasonable mechanisms are critically described.

In this study, we propose HighPlay, which integrates reinforcement learning (MCTS) with the HighFold structural prediction model to design cyclic peptide sequences based solely on the target protein sequence information, to achieve the synergistic optimization of cyclic peptide sequences and binding sites and to dynamically explore the sequence space without the need for predefined target information. The model was applied to the design of cyclic peptide sequences for three different targets, which were screened and verified through molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating good binding affinity. Specifically, the cyclic peptide sequences designed for the TEAD4 target exhibited micromolar-level affinity in further experimental validation.",

In addition, oral treatment with 28f could significantly reduce the viral loads of HCoV-OC43 in mice, and compound 28f could also effectively reduce lung viral loads in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model without ritonavir.

While α-position disulfide bonds are advantageous for rapid response to redox conditions, they also risk premature drug leakage during circulation. This study introduces a steric hindrance-guided approach to engineer disulfide-bridged podophyllotoxin homodimeric prodrugs for spatiotemporal controlled delivery. By monomethyl or dimethyl substitution of the carbon atoms adjacent to the α-disulfide bond, we can modulate steric hindrance. Excessive hindrance destabilizes the nanoassemblies and slows effective drug release, while moderate hindrance (monomethyl modification) enhances pharmacokinetic properties and promotes selective tumor activation. In vivo studies indicate that monomethyl-modified prodrug nanoassemblies exhibit superior antitumor efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity compared to PPT solution. This work underscores the importance of steric hindrance in optimizing prodrug nanoassembly stability and tumor-specific activation, offering a comprehensive strategy for redox-responsive nanomedicines.",

RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute the largest class of ubiquitin enzymes, providing a scaffold for substrate recognition and catalysis. Their shallow groove recognition interfaces involving discontinuous epitopes and a lack of defined binding pockets have largely rendered them undruggable. Inspired by natural RING inhibitors, we have developed a pharmacophore-based strategy for the rational design of peptidomimetics targeting RING domains, and we demonstrate its feasibility by using the macromolecular APC/C complex (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome). We designed scaffolds binding to the APC/C RING domain and efficiently inhibiting its activity in vitro. Iterative structure-based design and experimental studies to optimize their chemical stability, permeability, and specificity lead to new hydrocarbon-stapled-based molecules inhibiting APC/C in vitro and in cancer cells. Our results provide a robust rationale for targeting RING-containing enzymes of therapeutic value and promising leads for clinical APC/C inhibition.",

However, the reasons for this pharmacokinetic behavior are less explored. Herein, we focused on identifying potential mechanisms for our previously developed heterobivalent (SST2/albumin) [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-cLAB-TATEs. For this purpose, we designed two novel derivatives that show either negligible binding to albumin or lack the SST2-targeting capability. Based on the in vivo results, we hypothesize that binding of the albumin-bound radioligand to SST2 in addition to that of the free radioligand causes the increased tumor uptake. This is supported by saturation binding analyses in the presence of albumin and compartment modeling considerations. Overall, the results of this study provide a first tentative explanation for the phenomenon of increased tumor uptake for albumin-binding radioligands, which may support the prospective design of such radioligands.",

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also known to be significantly influenced by the interfacial charge and mass transfer in a catalyst/H2O biphase system. Herein, for the first time, a highly stable and floating hydrogen‐water cogeneration hybrid hydrogel that utilizes photothermal‐induced interface microenvironment variation to accelerate sluggish photocatalytic water splitting reaction is reported. Supported by solar‐powered interfacial evaporation and efficient vapor generation, the rationally designed hydrogel effectively transforms the conventional liquid‐solid interface into a gas‐solid photocatalytic interface. The presence of gas‐liquid coexistence state offers a disordered and loose hydrogen‐bond network while preserving the proton transfer channel, greatly reducing reaction activation energy and interfacial energy barriers. The improved heat and mass transfer together with optimized charge transfer pathways suppress electron‐hole recombination, the integrated photothermal‐coupled solar photocatalytic hydrogel exhibits excellent operational stability and self‐adaptive rotation in seawater, mitigating salt accumulation and achieving an exceptional vapor generation rate of 4.71 kg m−2 h−1 and a hydrogen‐evolving rate of 1961.25 µmol g−1 h−1 under one sun illumination.",

However, conventional polymeric membranes are constrained by permeability‐selectivity trade‐off and instability under real‐world operating conditions. While covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold promise, their overlarge pores and poor film‐processibility are to be imperatively solved. Herein, a ternary building unit system is designed for synthesizing imine‐based COF nanosheets with programmable interlayer offsets. By synergizing a planar aldehyde monomer as the basic structural unit and a none‐planar alkyl‐functionalized aldehyde monomer as the structure regulation unit, we induce layer distortion that disrupts π–π dominated AA stacking, enabling angstrom‐precise pore tuning (1.4–0.6 nm) via controlled transitions to AB stacking while retaining crystallinity. The mechanically robust nanosheets are easily assembled into large‐area membranes via a facile blade casting, overcoming the processability bottleneck associated with binary building unit systems. The resulting membranes demonstrate an exceptional H2/CO2 selectivity of 60, surpassing existing benchmarks. When treating gas mixtures from methanol steam reforming, a two‐stage membrane process achieves 99.5% H2 purity and 94.0% recovery. Precise modulation of pore architecture and mechanical flexibility through building units engineered stacking affords a platform for microporous organic membranes.",

    "abstract": "Abstractπ‐conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability. Nevertheless, the effective control over their dielectric properties is a challenge. Herein, the charge carrier migration in π‐conjugated MOFs is harnessed to significantly amplify the electromagnetic response, where the strengthened atom coordination can activate a distinctive conductance‐reinforced attenuation mechanism. This results in finely calibrated EMW absorption characteristics, including a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at mere 2 mm, a minimum reflection loss of −46.7 dB at 3.5 mm, and a substantial reduction in radar cross‐section (RCS) up to −23.3 dBm2. Furthermore, the seamless integration of the π‐conjugated MOF hybrids within ultraviolet (UV)‐curable 3D printing technology has enabled the fabrication of a stealth‐enabled drone propeller prototype, which exhibits a remarkably low infrared emissivity of 0.205. Additionally, when the propeller device is subjected to a 100 °C heating platform for 30 min, its surface temperature remains below 50 °C, demonstrating exceptional thermal management and stability under elevated temperature conditions. This work underscores the immense potential of these cutting‐edge absorbers to shape the future of advanced military stealth technologies.",

Here, Cu2‐xS is identified as a promising candidate to overcome this limitation due to its hierarchical phase transitions. Using in situ biasing experiments, reversible and non‐reversible phase transitions (and resistive switching) are demonstrated in γ‐Cu2S by controlling the compliance current. The formation of parallel high‐digenite Cu1.8S channels, orientated along the γ‐Cu2S [201] crystallographic direction, drives the nonvolatile resistive switching. These channels emerge via an intermediate δ‐Cu2S phase and are stabilized at room temperature by residual strains, alongside β‐Cu2S phase. The work clarifies the complex, electrically triggered phase transformations in γ‐Cu2S, and highlights the potential of Cu2‐xS as a versatile material for neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising thermoelectric cooling candidate, exhibiting room‐temperature performance comparable to that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). However, the Seebeck coefficient of p‐type SnSe crystals remains significantly lower than that of n‐type Bi₂(Te, Se)₃ (BTS), and the resulting mismatches hinder effective utilization of its excellent cooling potential. To address this limitation, resonant levels are introduced in the valence bands of hole‐doped SnSe through indium‐doping, which increased the density of states and thereby boosted the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy enable the power factor to reach ≈55 µWcm−1K−2 and ZT value of ≈1.0 at 300 K, with a more matching Seebeck coefficient of ≈211 µVK−1. Furthermore, a full‐scale thermoelectric cooler incorporating the p‐type SnSe paired with n‐type BTS demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference (ΔTmax) of ≈81.1 K at 343 K. A SnSe‐based single‐leg device achieve a conversion efficiency of ≈7.0% under a ΔT of 250 K. These findings highlight that matching thermoelectric parameter of p‐type and n‐type materials is crucial for enhancing the cooling efficiency of devices, and engineering resonant energy levels constitutes a robust strategy for solving the inherent performance limitations of p‐type SnSe in practical thermoelectric applications.",

Here, a 3D structure smaller is developed than a single cell, that a Self‐Adhesion‐Tunnel (SAT) is called, that causes cells to wrap around it and bind to themselves. This process is driven through the cadherin proteins that regulate cell‐cell adhesion, and it is shown that many of the key elements of a normal cell‐cell adhesion are found in self‐adhesions. Size and shape of the SAT determine the efficiency of self‐adhesion formation, and >90% efficient formation of self‐adhesions are observed in both kidney and skin cells per SAT. Self‐adhesions can persist for at least 24 hrs and act to stabilize the cell‐material interface and reduce migration. Overall, this ability to co‐opt the native cell‐cell adhesion machinery in cells and use it as an attachment strategy can provide new approaches for soft‐tissue implant integration and tissue engineering scaffolds where stable tissue‐material interfaces are critical.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIon transport in environments with mixed ions is crucial for numerous real‐world applications. However, most membranes suffer from reduced selectivity in the mixed ion environment. Herein, the concept of dual‐nanoconfined channels in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated for superior mixed mono‐/multivalent ion separation. By incorporating acidic functionalities into the pore wall and coupling with a suitable pore size in the COF membranes, multivalent ions interact strongly with the acidic groups. This shields the interactions of the wall with monovalent ions, leaves sufficient space for fast monovalent ion passage, and in the meantime blocks multivalent ions, creating well‐defined dual‐nanoconfinement for mixed ion separation. Consequently, mixed Li+/Mg2+ ion selectivity exceeding 1,300 and mono‐/trivalent ion selectivity over 9,000 is achieved. Molecular dynamics simulation and experiment with multiple ion pairs further confirm the mechanisms. The study sheds light on a fundamentally new design principle for mixed ion separation, offering the potential to reach remarkable selectivity in practical applications.",

However, the clinical use of neuroregulatory strategies for repairing infarcted myocardium, such as vagus nerve stimulation and pharmacological activation, confronts the challenges of managing stimulation signals and potential drug side effects. In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a “pre‐neuralized” scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. Strontium silicate promotes NSCs differentiation, resulting in a scaffold enriched with mature neurons. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that enhance the maturation and synchronized contraction of cardiomyocytes, facilitating myocardial repair and improving cardiac function in vivo. The findings indicate that the pre‐neuralized scaffold aids myocardial recovery by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural‐induced regulation in tissue repair. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to repairing infarcted myocardium using inorganic biomaterial‐induced scaffolds with neuromodulatory properties from the perspective of systemically physiological regulation.

However, LRO exhibits large voltage hysteresis and rapid voltage decay with irreversible TM migration upon prolonged cycling. Given that high‐entropy oxides have expanded the potential for retarding the harmful phase transition and regulating the site energies, therefore a high‐entropy Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.12Co0.12Mg0.03Cu0.02Ti0.02Nb0.02O2 cathode is synthesized (HELRO) for LIBs in the present study, demonstrated significantly improved voltage retention and energy output. In addition, this work unveils the sluggish degradation of superlattice and local structure in HELRO during long charge–discharge cycles and explains the “migration retardation effect.” The higher configurational entropy contributes to the higher energy barriers for in‐plane, out‐of‐plane, and continuous Mn migrations due to the synergistic ionic–covalent enhancement of Mn─O bonds.

Although positive aging enhances device performance, its random and uncontrollable process presents substantial challenges for QLED industrialization. Here, It is identified that the H2O, produced by the reaction between the acidic resin and ZnMgO, can slowly passivate the defects of ZnMgO and is thus responsible for the positive aging. By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post‐annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. As a result, the fresh devices exhibit a high efficiency of 55.2 lm W−1 (26%), which is 2.04 (1.67)‐fold higher than those of untreated devices and 1.21 (1.02)‐fold higher than those of untreated devices after positive aging. Moreover, the performance of the treated devices remains very stable even after storage for several days, indicating the undesired positive aging is completely eliminated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, can promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.",

Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual‐anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high‐quality MA‐free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent‐free spin‐coating process.

Simultaneously, the combination of Ac− and thiocyanate anions (SCN−) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual‐anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non‐radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single‐junction Sn‐Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn‐Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent.

For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long‐circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein‐resistant yet cell membrane‐binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell‐membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N‐alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N‐alkyl chain became cell membrane‐philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)‐loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple‐negative breast cancer models.

Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and  transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon‐conducting ceramics offer a low‐density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4 W m−1 K−1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi‐generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low‐loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m−1 K−1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post‐processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly‐lactic acid  matrix from surface‐modified boron nitride platelets, creating a “hetero‐percolated network”. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.",

Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono‐disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra‐dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room‐temperature structural transformation‐induced in situ core‐shell self‐assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre‐core‐shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit >80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential >80 mV) even after >10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single‐photon emission with g(2)(0) M is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon‐based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium‐ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide‐based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double‐layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of π‐conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub‐graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon‐like large π‐conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen‐free edge C(sp2)–H sites, and well‐defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g−1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g−1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials. These findings provide a fundamental design strategy for carbon‐based cathodes in LICs that highlighting the role of π‐conjugation and edge chemistry in electrochemical performance, paving the way for next‐generation high‐capacity, high‐voltage energy storage devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid‐state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)‐vacancies (O‐LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐based CPEs (PEO@O‐LZO). The O‐LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O‐vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O‐vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O‐LZO at 40 °C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O‐LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40 °C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid‐state lithium metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non‐invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off‐target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic‐based Calibrated 5‐ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non‐pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5‐ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia‐inducible promoter regulating O‐acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post‐treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor‐specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5‐ALA‐based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor‐targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConcrete, the world's second most utilized material after water, is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse emissions. Current carbon capturing and storage (CCS) concrete often involves convoluted processes, slow kinetics, limited CO2 uptake, non‐uniform carbonation in structures, and high cost. Efforts to enhance carbon sequestration often rely on increasing porosities, which compromise the mechanical strength of the resulting concrete. The 3D printing of CCS concrete is reported by incorporating diatomaceous earth (DE), a highly accessible biomineral with hierarchical porosity, into triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures. DE enables stable extrusion, high print fidelity, and reduced density, which are crucial for 3D concrete printing. Further, DE facilitates CaCO3 nucleation within the concrete and mitigates carbonation resistance, achieving a maximum CO2 absorption of 488.7 gCO2 per kg cement in 7 days, a 142% increase over conventional concrete. Optimizing TPMS geometry further enhances carbonation efficiency by enabling uniform CO2 uptake throughout the structure. This geometry refinement reduces material usage by 78% and increases the surface‐area‐to‐volume ratio by 515%, leading to a 30% higher CO2 uptake while preserving mechanical integrity. The material strategy, together with the optimized concrete printing of TPMS structures, offers a pathway toward scalable and sustainable solutions without undermining concrete's structural functions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSpinel LiMn2O4 is a promising cathode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to its nontoxicity, resource abundance, substantial operating voltage, and remarkable thermal stability. Nevertheless, LiMn2O4 is subjected to subpar electronic/ion conductivity and continuous capacity attenuation triggered by the Jahn‐Teller distortion. In this regard, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential morphological controllers that impact particle size and crystal orientation and offer vacancy‐accepting layers that facilitate oxygen defect formation, which boost electron/ion diffusion when utilized as self‐sacrificial templates. The dissatisfying capacity retention caused by Mn2+ dissolution related to the Mn3+ disproportion is another tricky issue, which requires resolution through surface modification. To attain these goals, this work develops a strategy intermarrying the merits of oxygen defects and Zn‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework‐62 (Zn‐ZIF‐62) glass shields. Mn‐MOFs with carboxyl‐based ligands possessing various coordination numbers are adopted as precursors to optimize the morphological feature and modulate the oxygen vacancy level. Computational and experimental results examine the efficaciousness of oxygen defects in ameliorating the electrochemical activity and expediting electron/ion transportation. Synchronously, the ZIF‐62 glass layer inhibits manganese loss and phase degradation toward prolonged cycling durability in LIB half/full cells. This study envisions a versatile methodology to modify spinel LiMn2O4 as a longevous cathode for next‐generation LIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractStructured catalysts, characterized by continuous, highly porous architectures, have long been recognized for their ability to enhance thermal stability, mechanical robustness, and operational efficiency in catalytic processes. Nevertheless, the use of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their exceptional atomic efficiency, in structured, shaped, or printed forms remains an emerging challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in maintaining atomic dispersion and ensuring stability under processing and reaction conditions. This review explores recent developments in the design and use of structured single‐atom catalysts (collectively referred to as stru‐SACs herein), focusing on their unique properties and the potential benefits of combining the atomic precision of SACs with engineered architectures. The composition of structured supports, ranging from traditional materials, such as ceramics and metals, to advanced materials, such as graphene, carbon, and aerogels, are examined. Additionally, functional active sites, innovative fabrication strategies, and advanced characterization techniques required to probe the atomic‐scale environments of stru‐SACs are discussed. The applications of stru‐SACs are reviewed across thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis, with an emphasis on how the electronic and structural characteristics of these materials enhance the catalytic performance. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives of stru‐SACs are outlined.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on electrode materials remains a critical challenge in the development of alkali metal‐ion batteries, with its complex formation mechanism and diverse composition significantly impacting practical performance. Herein a theory‐guided prediction approach is presented to construct a rigid–soft coupling SEI, engineered through the strategic regulation of both interfacial and bulk electrochemistry for the design of nitrogen‐ and boron‐coordinated cobalt single atoms within nitrogen‐doped carbon (Co–N₃B/C) anodes. The experimental and theoretical findings reveal that the distinctive Co–N3B configuration tends to generate a local electric field that benefits for fast Na+ transfer kinetics and the decomposition of fluorinated electrolyte, resulting in the formation of a robust inorganic‐rich SEI. Consequently, the dual‐coordinated Co single‐atom electrode design, coupled with the hybrid organic–inorganic SEI, endows the sodium‐ion batteries anode with a high capacity of 230.5 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and exceptional long‐term cycling stability, as evidenced by 97.0% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1. This study not only demonstrates the significant advantages of single‐atom catalysis in controlling SEI formation and electrolyte degradation but also paves the way for using this technology to enhance the performance of carbon‐based anodes in a wide range of metal‐ion batteries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the growing scarcity of worldwide energy and freshwater resources, utilizing abundant seawater for hydrogen production via electrolysis has become imperative. However, due to the multi‐electron intermediate process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the competition reaction/erosion from Cl−, the design of highly selective and corrosion‐resistant seawater electrocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, Ce‐decorated NiFe LDH nanosheets array anchored on vertically aligned CuO nanowire (CeNiFe@CuO) is fabricated by one‐step electrodeposition strategy, where Ce doping increases the Lewis acidity and crystal imperfection degree of the composite. The CeNiFe@CuO can achieve high current density of 500 mA cm−2 with overpotential of 265 and 280 mV in KOH and alkaline natural seawater, respectively, and remain stable for 300 h at 500 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater without apparent corrosion. Systematic experiments and mechanism analysis confirm that the excellent OER activity can be attributed to the introduction of Ce species, which bring massive oxygen vacancies and accelerate the Ni component oxidation rate. Moreover, the CeNiFe@CuO exhibits enhanced surface OH− adsorption kinetics and capacity, resulting in electrostatic exclusion of Cl− to achieve high OER stability and selectivity. This study provides new insights into the development of efficient corrosion‐resistant electrocatalysts for high‐current seawater electrolysis.",

This paper explores the application of non‐volatile combined bit (c‐bit) devices, exhibiting back‐hopping‐like phenomena, in logical operations, arithmetic computations, and data backup and recovery. Logical reverse inferences are successfully implemented for AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR operations. Importantly, the logical reverse inference of full and half adders is achieved, as well as the decomposition of addends, verifying the feasibility of c‐bit devices in complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, by utilizing multiple c‐bit devices working in tandem, efficient data backup and reliable recovery are achieved, offering a novel solution for data security. This research not only enriches the theoretical framework of probabilistic computing but also provides new insights and directions for the future development of computational models.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLi‐rich layered oxide cathodes (LLOs) with anionic redox are promising to boost the energy density of lithium batteries beyond 500 Wh kg−1. However, their commercialization has long been hampered by inherent drawbacks, particularly voltage decay and hysteresis, which reduce energy density and efficiency, shorten battery life, and challenge battery management. To address these issues, a prerequisite is establishing a comprehensive understanding of voltage‐related phenomena correlated with anionic redox reactions (ARR), which remains elusive despite extensive research. Therefore, in this review, the proposed mechanisms are systematically summarized and the fundamental origins of voltage decay and hysteresis are identified, together with elucidating their relationship with ARR. Voltage decay is mainly attributed to irreversible TM migration and phase transition, whose driving force involves factors like lattice strain accumulation and oxygen loss. A relatively unified theory, the asymmetric non‐equilibrium reaction path during ARR, is identified as the fundamental origin of voltage hysteresis. This path includes sequential electrochemical reactions and chemical processes (sluggish electronic and atomic structural rearrangements, such as TM migration and ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer). Recent achievements and effective solutions for these voltage issues are also elaborated. After deeply understanding voltage decay and hysteresis, inspiring insights for mitigation strategies and forward‐looking remarks are provided.",

The continuously growing demand for urea has spurred an escalation in production. Considering the impacts of byproducts during urea production, it is urgent to explore cost‐effective and environmentally benign urea synthesis methods. Artificial photosynthesis, which utilizes renewable solar power to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2), not only provides a sustainable alternative for urea synthesis but also reduces carbon emissions and fixes nitrogen simultaneously. This review delves into the C−N coupling pathways, key intermediates, and their detection methodologies in photocatalytic urea production. It also discusses the rational design and selection of targeted photocatalysts toward urea synthesis, highlighting their key characteristics that determine the rate‐limiting steps. Furthermore, it systematically examines the challenges in photocatalytic urea synthesis and evaluates viable solutions to overcome these limitations. By identifying current obstacles and proposing potential strategies, this review aims to advance artificial photosynthesis as a sustainable and eco‐friendly approach for urea production.

    "abstract": "AbstractLow‐hysteresis merits in polymeric gel materials can significantly enhance their operational reliability and service lifetime in emerging applications such as smart wearable devices. However, fabricating gel materials with low hysteresis and high toughness remains challenging due to their intrinsic contradictory attributes, particularly in ionic liquid (IL)‐based systems. Herein, a water‐mediated polymer network reorganization strategy is presented for developing tough and low hysteresis ionohydrogels (IHGs) containing ILs, where the synergistic effect between covalent crosslinking and dynamic interfacial lubrication governs their exceptional performance. Water can act as a lubricating mediator to moderately attenuate interactions between ILs and polymer chains, thereby enabling the formation of dynamically adaptive networks that facilitate chain mobility and stress redistribution. Therefore, the IHGs fabricated through water content modulation achieve a well‐balanced combination of high toughness (2.2 MJ m−3) and low hysteresis (8.1% at 400% strain). Meanwhile, the prepared IHGs demonstrate superior comprehensive performance, including high stretchability, excellent tensile strength, superior electrical conductivity, good biocompatibility, and transparency. Finally, the IHGs can function as high‐performance wearable sensors and biocompatible epidermal electrodes, enabling real‐time health monitoring and acquisition of high‐fidelity electrophysiological signals. The simple strategy overcomes the traditional trade‐offs of low hysteresis and high toughness, demonstrating exceptional potential in real‐life scenarios.",

However, how to efficiently generate 1O2 by modulating the asymmetric structure and electron spin state of catalyst remains a challenge. Herein, an asymmetric Fe─S─Co structured catalyst (Co‐Fe3S4) is designed by in situ substitution of FeIIITd strategy. The strong interaction in the asymmetric structure induces a low‐spin state (e: ↑↓, ↑↓, t2: ↑↓, _, _) at d‐orbital of Co sites, shifting the d‐band center closer to the Fermi level and elevating the antibonding states, which is beneficial for the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The catalyst accelerates 1O2 generation by PMS activation, achieving 100% removal of acetaminophen in pharmaceutical wastewater in 8 min with a high K‐value of 112 min⁻¹ M⁻¹. Experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the spin state of the generated *O2 (from the S─O bond cleavage in HSO5−) is reduced by electron reversal (↓ to ↑) or pairing (↑, ↑ to ↑↓, _) in the 2p (2px and 2py) orbitals of the O─O anti‐π bond (π*), resulting in the 1O2 generation.

Periodic atomic structure in the 1T‐phase MoS2 is constructed to enhance symmetrical electric field distribution and those phase interlaced regions promoted a significant increase in dielectric relaxation. Benefiting the boosted dielectric ability and polarization behaviors, 1T‐phase dominated MoS2@MWCNTs (TMC) exhibit superior EM wave energy dissipation with the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value of −74.3 dB at only 1.7 mm thickness.

Nevertheless, Mn‐based RFBs face a critical challenge: the undesired formation of crystalline MnO2 through Mn3+ disproportionation and irreversibility of MnO2 deposits on electrode surfaces severely diminish accessible reaction sites and restrict achievable areal capacity. Herein, it is demonstrated that ligand chelation‐mediated structural transformation of MnO2 by sodium diphosphate (Na4P2O7, PPi) modulates MnO2 deposition behavior. The PPi coordinate with Mn2+ to form a stable [Mn(HPO4)2(H2O)2]2− chelate, which facilitates the incorporation of defective O and P into the evolving MnO2 structure, effectively disrupting its crystallographic ordering and converting MnO2 from crystalline to amorphous configuration. The amorphous MnO2 tends to flow into the electrolyte instead of depositing on the electrode due to the electrostatic interplay, thereby resulting in a breakthrough areal capacity of 91.5 mAh cm−2 (300 cycles @ 99.7% CE) and 141.8 mAh cm−2 (150 cycles @ 98.2% CE, the highest reported values), representing a 10‐fold enhancement compared to additive‐free counterparts.

ZIF‐8 is found to undergo degradation under acidic conditions releasing its cargo and Zn2+ to induce cell pyroptosis. CDG triggers the activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines release, dendritic cell (DC) maturation and CD8+ T cell infiltration. siXkr8 inhibits the expression of scramblase mXkr8 and decreases the phosphatidylserine translocation to the cell surface, thus decreasing immature DCs and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reversing TIME. In a murine CRC model, CSZ@Gel exhibits significant tumor growth suppression effects, extends the median survival time of mice to more than 60 days, and significantly inhibits CRC recurrence after resection by long‐term synergistic anti‐tumor immune activation.

However, when arranged in large‐scale arrays, their performance is often hindered by challenges such as poor reliability and sneak currents. To address these, Al, N‐doped TaOx (ANTO) memristors are precisely engineered in this study using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The oxygen vacancy (Vo) content in TaOx can be regulated by controlling the dopant concentrations via the number of ALD cycles, thereby effectively adjusting the Schottky barrier height and surface resistance. This optimizes the oxygen ion‐based interface‐type resistive switching while improving the self‐rectifying properties. Furthermore, Vo passivation by N‐doping effectively suppresses sneak currents in crossbar arrays. Optimized devices exhibit endurance exceeding 3.5 × 104 cycles and 3‐bit retention over 103 s. Their long‐term potentiation and depression characteristics are highly accurate in synaptic neural network‐based image recognition tasks. Hardware‐level demonstrations using the fabricated 32 × 32 crossbar array confirm stable analog switching, reliable multibit programming, and effective suppression of sneak‐path currents under practical operating conditions. Notably, selective multilevel programming is validated through conductance mapping, demonstrated by visualizing a word pattern within the crossbar array.

The unique open hierarchical architecture provides atomic‐scale anchoring sites for small‐sized Mo4P3 quantum dots (QDs), forming a high‐density “electron island‐substrate” micro‐interface network, which drastically increases the population of active micro‐interface sites between the two phases. Concurrently, the discretely distributed QDs induce interfacial charge polarization through quantum confinement effects, generating a robust built‐in electric field at the heterointerfaces that drives directional electron migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows the interfacial interaction between NiCoP and Mo4P3 can effectively manipulate the electronic architecture and regulate the H* adsorption energy, further decreasing the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*). FeP@NiCoP/Mo4P3 can make full use of the active sites generated at the interface, to give full play to the catalytic properties of heterogeneous structures, which ensures the significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic efficiency and excellent long‐term stability in alkaline water and complicated seawater environments. This work provides guidance and direction to maximize the interface effect for designing efficient and stable catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractShort‐chain sulfur species with high redox activity have significant applied implications as electrode materials for Na/K‐ion batteries. However, the synthesis of short‐chain sulfur composites that simultaneously feature high sulfur content and high conductivity remains a significant challenge. Herein, the facile fabrication of conductive short‐chain sulfur composite with ultra‐high sulfur content (42.5 wt%) for efficient Na/K‐ion storage is reported. The protocol relied only on the industrial pitch and elemental sulfur as precursor via a simple heat treatment at low temperature (e.g. 450 °C). Rich delocalized C═C and C═S bonds are introduced into the carbon skeleton, forming the spatial π‐electron conjugation and spatial sp2‐hybridization, and resulting in a six‐order‐of‐magnitude enhancement of the electronic conductivity compared to the pitch‐derive carbon. The short‐chain sulfur species demonstrate superb reactivity with both Na‐ion and K‐ion without dissoluble polysulfide formation. A surface‐dominated storage mechanism enables outstanding electrode kinetics with diminished electrode deformation. As anodes, this composite delivers extraordinary reversible capacities for both Na‐ion (848 mAh g−1) and K‐ion (699 mAh g−1) storage with superior rate and promising cyclability. Moreover, this anode could even deliver impressive battery performances for K‐ion storage at a high mass loading (10.2 mg cm−2) of the active composite.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectronic skin (E‐skin) that emulates the human skin's three basic functions (perception, protection, and thermoregulation) has broad applied potential in smart healthcare and human‐machine interaction (HMI). To fully realize the integration functions and simulate the structure of real skin, this work reactivates the “dead leather” back to intelligent E‐skin (Leather/Ag/Polyborosiloxane elastomer) and further develops its application in harsh scenarios. The Ag nanowires/flakes incorporated leather fiber acts as the dermis layer to endow the E‐skin with good electric conductivity, force sensitivity, and electrothermal management. The hierarchical structure allows the incident electromagnetic waves to be reflected and absorbed multiple times, possessing a superior electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding value (≈75 dB). Due to the unique rate‐dependent shear stiffening effects originated from the polyborosiloxane elastomer, the E‐skin achieves significant force buffering capacity (≈47%) and excellent energy dissipation (over 85%). Moreover, the LAP E‐skin exhibits unconventional sensing behavior, including piezoresistive sensing and impact stimulation, allowing for differentiation between low‐energy and high‐energy stimuli. On this basis, an elegant smart vest is successfully developed with exceptional thermal therapy, accurate contact perception, and wireless impact monitoring, demonstrating broad potential in the next generation of wearable protective equipment and smart robotics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe recently discovered long‐range topological spin textures exhibit spontaneous Hall effects, which offer a breakthrough solution to the challenge of write‐in and readout of spin information in antiferromagnets. Despite this advancement, the implementation of such long‐range magnetic orders in single‐crystal nanoflakes remains limited, which can otherwise enhance the design flexibility of heterostructures and open new possibilities for next‐generation ultracompact, high‐speed, and low‐power spintronic devices. Here, air‐stable intercalated Co1/3TaS2 single‐crystal nanoflakes are reported, demonstrating two magnetic phase transitions and a potential charge density wave phase transition. Transport measurements confirmed the persistence of non‐coplanar antiferromagnetic order in exfoliated Co1/3TaS2 nanoflakes, characterized by a spontaneous topological Hall effect with rectangular shape and moderate coercive fields. The underlying mechanisms of the two magnetic phase transitions, as well as the anomalous Hall effect resulting from skew scattering observed above the Néel temperature, are investigated. Furthermore, the successful integration of Co1/3TaS2 nanoflake into van der Waals heterostructure underscores the potential for diverse device applications. This study enhances the understanding of non‐coplanar antiferromagnetic order and advances the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics.",

Herein, two isomeric Zn‐Salen metal covalent organic frameworks (Zn‐Salen‐MCOFs) with kgd‐v or hcb topology are designed as robust and efficient photocatalysts for dual‐channel H2O2 photosynthesis. Zn‐Salen‐MCOF with kgd‐v topology shows a higher H2O2 photocatalytic production rate of 6617/3438 µmol gcat.−1 h−1 in pure water with/without additional O2 or air saturation, together with long‐time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance (100 h). The framework isomerism effect and the chelated linkages contribute to the improved H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency and stability of it. A three‐step 2e⁻ WOR with the initial H2O adsorption over the ZnO2N2 unit and a four‐step 2e⁻ ORR reaction mechanism with the key Had adsorption at the pyrazinic N site are proposed. This study paves the way for developing robust MCOF‐based photocatalysts for dual‐channel H2O2 production based on chelated linkage and framework isomerism effect.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the use of 2‐(carboxyethyl) (dimethyl)sulfonium bromide (CDMSBr), a carboxyl‐functionalized derivative of trimethylsulfonium (TMS+), as an additive in ternary cation, (Cs0.05FA0.90MA0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 [CsFAMA]), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to enhance both stability and photovoltaic performance. In solution, it exhibits a zwitterionic form that controls nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. It further protonates into CDMS+ during crystallization to facilitate the formation of larger and more uniform grains with better crystallinity. Optimized CsFAMA‐based device achieves power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.02% (enhancement of 6.54%) at 1‐sun condition and 38.79% (enhancement of 9.21%) under low‐intensity indoor lighting (1000‐lx, LED 5000 K). The dual role of the additive in defect passivation and grain size enhancement contributes to reduced trap density, promoting increased stability of the PSCs. Devices with CDMSBr maintain 88.53% of their initial PCE after 960 h in ambient conditions. These findings highlight the potential of carboxyl‐functionalized sulfonium additives, like CDMSBr, to enhance perovskite morphology and stability, advancing the performance and operational durability of PSCs.",

This review article presents a complete examination of current progress in HE‐MOFs and their derived materials for diverse catalytic reactions, including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and thermal catalysis. Various strategies for boosting the catalytic reactivity of HE‐MOFs and their derived materials have been discussed, including pore architecture modulation, morphological control, defect engineering, elemental composition tuning, and interface optimization. A thorough investigation has been conducted on various catalytic reactions like water splitting, oxygen reduction, nitrogen reduction, alcohol oxidation, hydrogenation, and cycloaddition. Furthermore, the underlying structure–property correlation governing their activity has been discussed, and key challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field have been highlighted. The insights presented in this review aim to guide the rational design of next‐generation high‐entropy materials for sustainable and efficient catalytic processes.",

Despite such interest, acceptable results were obtained only by modifying the norbornadiene‐quadricyclane (NBD‐QC) system, still leaving key issues unsolved. Here, we have designed a full storage‐release MOST cycle based on the Paternò‐Büchi reaction, potentially offering a class of compounds with a significantly higher storage density than NBD‐QC. Based on the experimental evidence concerning the viability of their synthesis and photoreactivity, we have repurposed those compounds by computationally elucidating the substitution pattern effects on low‐energy isomer’s light absorption, followed by high‐energy isomer’s photoproduction, including singlet and triplet states involved by the Paternò‐Büchi type of reactivity. The thermal conversion back to the initial isomer to release the stored energy was also studied, including a sustainable option by taking advantage of enzymatic activity.",

Nevertheless, the direct formation of C3 products encounters significant limitations due to the C2–C1 coupling reaction, posing a considerable challenge to improving their faradaic efficiency. Here, we present a design for an elevated pressure cascade catalytic reactor to convert CO2 to C3 products in a two‐step electrochemical process. At 25 bar pressure, by regulating the potential of the cascade system and the electrolyte flow rate we report a 40% selectivity for 2‐propanol on a copper electrode placed upstream of a silver electrode that converts CO2 to CO. In cascade mode (with both silver and copper electrodes active), the C3:C2 oxygenate ratio significantly increases to 7 compared to the non‐cascade mode (copper only) with a modest ratio of about 0.6. Thereby, our elevated pressure cascade electrolysis approach demonstrates a notable step forward in CO2 electroreduction to oxygenated C3 products.",

    "abstract": "Cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX₃, X=I, Br or their mixture) have emerged as a type of promising photovoltaic material due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, thermal stability and low cost. Despite the great progress achieved in the corresponding photovoltaic devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags far behind their theoretical limit. Comparing with the obtained high current density and fill factor, it is of great potential for increasing the open‐circuit voltage (Voc) value as the Voc loss of the CsPbX3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still quite significant considering their wide bandgap. The primary mechanisms of Voc loss involve non‐radiative recombination driven by bulk defects, interfacial defects and energy level mismatching. To address the above issues, numerous strategies have been investigated including additive engineering, interface modification, charge transport layer replacement, etc. Herein, this review summarizes the most recent work on mitigating Voc loss of CsPbX3 PSCs from three aspects, namely bulk film optimization, interface regulation and transport layer optimization, and gives a brief outlook on how to promote the Voc further. With this, a guideline is provided for researchers engaging in developing CsPbX3 PSCs with high photovoltaic performance.",

    "abstract": "Enantiopure β‐chlorohydrins are valuable intermediates in organic synthesis, acting as chiral building blocks for obtaining biologically active compounds. This work presents a one‐pot two‐step linear sequence for the efficient deracemization of β‐chlorohydrins by combining a photocatalytic alcohol oxidation with a stereoselective carbonyl bioreduction using alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Despite the thermodynamic challenges of the oxidation step for this family of substrates, three efficient photochemical conditions under white light irradiation were found using catalytic 2,4,6‐triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPPT) or 2,3‐dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ) in this case in stoichiometric or by in situ regeneration of the catalyst. In addition, its sunlight‐driven applicability and its implementation in flow chemistry were demonstrated. After testing the scope of these methodologies, 2‐chloro‐1‐arylethanols were found as suitable substrates. For those β‐halohydrins oxidized with complete conversion, the deracemization strategy was successfully achieved yielding twelve enantiopure (R)‐ and (S)‐β‐halohydrins. Furthermore, 2‐chloro‐1‐phenylethanol enantiomers were subjected to an additional chemical cyclization under basic conditions, providing both (R)‐ and (S)‐styrene oxide in a three‐step one‐pot process and without loss of the optical activity.",

    "abstract": "Lithium manganese oxides (LMO) are highly promising sorbents for lithium extraction from Li‐containing brines with high salt contents due to their high sorption capacity and high selectivity toward lithium. However, conventional synthesis routes are limited in scale. Therefore, a novel spray‐drying method is presented herein, enabling a scalable synthesis of LMO sorbents for Li extraction. The ion‐exchange material is studied in both synthetic LiCl solutions and two different geothermal brines from the Upper Rhine Valley, demonstrating improved Li selectivity and extraction capabilities compared to materials from hydrothermal synthesis approaches. The extraction behavior in relevant mildly acidic environments is studied in detail. Further material improvements are achieved by substituting a fraction of Mn by Ti, which greatly reduced the dissolution of manganese during acid treatment in the first 5 extraction cycles from 5.6% to only 1.8%. In addition, the maximum sorption capacity of the Ti‐substituted LMO (LMTO) can be further increased from 5.05 mmol g for LMO (35.1 mg g) to 5.66 mmol g for LMTO (39.3 mg g) under optimized m/V ratios. Hence, the results reported herein present a pathway toward LMO‐based ion‐exchange materials for the direct lithium extraction on an industrial scale.",

    "abstract": "Global reliance on synthetic surfactants has led to significant environmental challenges, with current management and policy efforts proving to be largely ineffective. Sustainable and environment‐friendly surfactants offer a promising solution for mitigating these impacts. This study introduces an emulsifier composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and partially cation‐substituted hyaluronate (CHA), both of which are derived from abundant and cost‐effective natural polysaccharides. The synergistic interplay of electrostatic interactions and controlled molecular entanglement between these macromolecules significantly enhances the stability and ripening resistance of the water‐in‐oil emulsion. This optimized formulation demonstrates remarkable longevity, maintaining emulsion integrity for over 365 days while exhibiting exceptional salt tolerance and pH stability across various environmental conditions. Additionally, this entangled polysaccharide‐based Pickering emulsion demonstrated strong adhesion to leaf surfaces, resisting the effects of strong winds and the water‐repellent properties of the lotus leaves. These characteristics associated with microbial compatibility suggest that emulsifiers based on CNCs and CHA provide safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants, especially pertinent to the agrochemical sector.",

However, the high reaction barrier for CH bond breaking and uphill overall reaction lead to the slow kinetics of DMF coupling. Here, we reveal that [HSO4−] and water can collaboratively promote the rate‐limiting step of the CH bond breaking on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 catalyst. An in‐depth study suggests that water mediates hole transfer to the CH bond while [HSO4−] facilitates electron extraction, thus promoting electron and proton transfer on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 surface. Consequently, photocatalytic DMF coupling over Ru‐ZnIn2S4 produces diesel fuel precursors (DFPs) and H2 with benchmarking formation rates of 1.5 g gcatal.−1 h−1 and 9.7 mmol gcatal.−1 h−1, respectively.

Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is one of these technologies in which catalysts play an essential role. In this work, the impact of impurities in catalysts on the output of RCF is investigated. It is found that the yield of phenolic monomers is almost not influenced by the residual chloride (Cl) ions in the commercially available Ru/C catalyst. However, the presence of Cl ions in the catalyst facilitated hemicellulose removal and delignification. Moreover, the enzymatic conversion rate of cellulose in the solid residue increases after RCF, attributed to the enhanced removal of lignin and hemicellulose in the presence of Cl ions. The impact of Cl ions can be eliminated by removing the Cl ions in the catalyst. This work provides an engineering perspective for upscaling RCF technology using large‐scale synthesized catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Developing a selective lignin depolymerization process remains a daunting challenge due to lignin's inherent structural heterogeneity and chemical complexity. This study used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction to produce oligomeric lignin with controlled structural characteristics (narrow size distribution, lower molecular weight) and further subjected it to oxidative depolymerization using peracetic acid as an oxidant. Oxidation of lignin resulting from lactic acid/pyrazole and choline chloride/lactic acid extraction produces phenolic acids (Ph‐COOH) and dicarboxylic acid (DCA) as significant products. Our results show that the judicial choice of DES during extraction plays a critical role in determining the lignin chemical structure, which follows different oxidation pathways and results in different product selectivities. The generalization of this concept has been established with two different parent lignins, e.g., Douglas fir (D.fir) and wheat straw (WS). The overall process showed that the novel DES extraction not only provides a sustainable pathway for high‐purity lignin generation but also could be used as a tool to produce high‐value products selectively upon its oxidation, thus improving the overall lignin biorefinery process.",

However, both monomer and polymer syntheses typically require anaerobic and moisture‐free conditions, often employing hazardous reagents and solvents that limit scalability. Herein, efficient, scalable syntheses for poly(ethyl lipoate) and ethyl lipoate that incorporate Green Chemistry principles are disclosed. The synthesis of ethyl lipoate from lipoic acid on a 100‐gram scale (>80% yield) is optimized lowering the E‐factor (2.27) by an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Diphenyl phosphate, a nonhazardous commercial organic acid, is used to synthesize ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethyl lipoate) on a 50‐gram scale from cationic ROP (CROP). The polymerizations proceed under ambient atmosphere in low‐hazard and renewable solvents, and a mild depolymerization strategy to regenerate the monomer is developed. Due to their extreme molar mass, the materials possess unique mechanical and physical properties. Life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted on synthetic and recycling processes shows that the polydisulfide has competitive environmental impacts comparable to several commodity polymers, despite the latter having an efficiency advantage due to economies of scale. These discoveries establish an economical and scalable closed‐loop polymer platform that can be broadly applied to various polydisulfides sourced from 1,2‐dithiolanes such as lipoic acid.",

It is found that, upon replacing imine linkage with cyanated vinylene, under the irrdation of visible light, the H2O2 production rates (HPR) considerably increases from 2261 μmol h‐1 g‐1 to 7613 μmol h‐1 g‐1 in pure water and O2 atmosphere without the assistance of any sacrificial agent. Even though in air atmosphere, its HPR value still reaches 6339 μmol h‐1 g‐1 with good recyclability. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to the the enhanced polarity through the incoporation of strong polar sulfone or cyano groups in the COF frameworks, which brings about the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, high photocurrent intensity and low charge resistance as well as the increased surface hydrophilicity. The photocatalytic mechanism is studied by means of the theoretical calculations and comparative experiments conducted under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of the various scavengers for electron, hole, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical in the reaction system.",

Research studies are most generally carried out with pure gas streams of CO2, while the available real sources of CO2 are gases coming out from industrial plants and containing a low share of CO2, and a great diversity of impurities including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Here, we show that a molecular catalyst, [Rh(bpy)(Cp*)Cl]Cl (bpy = bipyridine, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), catalyzes CO2RR to formic acid using a quasi flue gas (5‐10% CO2 and 100 ppm NO2 or 50 ppm SO2) with substantial selectivity. This is made possible thanks to the modification of the cathode surface with a positively charged imidazolium layer, which greatly favors CO2RR over competing reactions, proton, NO2 and SO2 reductions. These results highlight the potential of combining molecular catalysis and electrode surface modification for electroreduction of diluted CO2 without prior carbon capture or purification.",

    "abstract": "Biomass waste, a renewable energy source, can be converted into electricity through electrochemical processes. Liquid catalytic fuel cells (LCFCs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to utilize complex biomass fuels directly. However, conventional LCFCs face challenges related to the cross‐membrane permeation of catalysts, which leads to electrolyte imbalance and cell failure. To address the issue, this study proposed a novel LCFC system using the same catalyst, molybdovanadophosphoric heteropolyacid (PMoV), on both the anode and cathode, effectively mitigating catalyst permeation. Under ambient conditions, the PMoV‐LCFC system achieved a maximum power density of 3.39 mW cm−2 using glucose as the fuel, and the system demonstrated stable performance over five days. Notably, cyclic discharge tests using expired bread as fuel further show the system's effectiveness. The total organic carbon degradation rate reached a maximum of 23.36%, and formic acid was the primary intermediate. The PMoV‐LCFC system effectively reduced catalyst crossover and maintained stable electrochemical performance, offering new insights for designing biomass fuel cells and significantly contributing to waste management.",

    "abstract": "The removal of molecular iodine (I2/I3−) from aqueous environments are of great importance due to their biological relevance and environmental concerns, particularly in nuclear waste management. In this work, we have demonstrated a hydrophobic tetrapodal receptor Se4Me‐PF6, that exhibits iodine adsorption from an aqueous phase via chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction. In the solution phase, NMR studies reveal that Se4Me‐PF6 selectively recognizes iodide (I−) over other anions. On the other hand, in the solid state, selenoimidazolium building units of Se4Me‐PF6 facilitate self‐assembly into a porous 1D supramolecular ChB framework, enabling efficient iodine adsorption. Consequently, Se4Me‐PF6 has propelled the rapid adsorption of iodine, with a high kinetic rate of 2.10 × 10−3 g·mg−1·min−1, while maintaining its effectiveness under competitive environmental conditions, including pH variations and the presence of interfering anions. Mechanistic investigations using XPS, and DFT studies indicate that iodine capture occurs via a combination of ChB interactions and electrostatic forces provided by the selenoimidazolium motifs. Importantly, Se4Me‐PF6 demonstrates its potential as a stationary phase for column‐based iodine removal, highlighting its applicability in real‐world scenarios. Thus, these findings offer a promising approach for developing iodine adsorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which produces propylene and by‐produces hydrogen, attracts considerable attention in the chemical industry. Alkali metals, budget friendly and commonly used as additives to optimize the performance of Pt‐based alloy catalysts, are extensively utilized in the PDH industry. Herein, the structure and catalytic performance of the commercial catalyst (PtK2/θ‐Al2O3) and contrast samples (Pt0.3K0.8/θ‐Al2O3‐N and Pt0.3/θ‐Al2O3) are analyzed. According to the catalytic test, the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 exhibits better catalytic performance, which achieves >95% propylene selectivity and maintaining a high propane yield (>36%) during stability testing. Observations reveal that the initial propylene selectivity of the Pt‐based catalysts is inversely correlated with the total acidity and strong acid site content. The introducing of K element significantly reduces the acidity of the catalyst and enhances the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the presence of Cl−, co‐introduced with K, improves the catalytic stability, while the slight increase in the acidity of catalysts decreases the propylene selectivity. The enrichment of the electron density of PtK2 nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggest that lower propylene adsorption energy and higher barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation reaction on the PtK2‐(100) surface enhance the propylene selectivity of the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 catalyst.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the development of suitable cocatalysts represents an effective strategy. Cocatalysts can interact with photocatalysts to improve light absorption capabilities and facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, they provide highly active surface sites that promote the adsorption and activation of CO2, which leads to acceleration of photocatalytic reduction. Herein, WO3 is employed as a cocatalyst to promote the CO2 photoreduction performance of a g-C3N4-TiO2 heterojunction through a facile and scalable calcination method. In pure water, optimal WO3/g-C3N4-TiO2 (WCT) delivers high selectivity CO and CH4 formation of 48.31 µmol·g−1 and 77.18 µmol·g−1 in the absence of a sacrificial reagent and extra photosensitizer, roughly 13.9 and 45.7 times higher than that of g-C3N4-TiO2 (CT). WO3 can strongly interact with g-C3N4-TiO2 electronically, guiding electrons across the interface to the surface. The oxygen vacancies in WO3, as electron-enriched centers, not only enhance charge separation and form efficient charge transfer channels but also capture photogenerated electrons to suppress charge recombination. This strong interaction and oxygen vacancies in WO3 jointly improve photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, offering a feasible way to design efficient cocatalysts.",

This work focused on evaluating the literature related to the antiproliferative activity of extracts obtained from plants of the genus Tabebuia and molecules isolated in vitro or in vivo. For the search, MeSH and DECS terms were employed in the PubMed, Scopus, and SciELO databases. Research has shown that plant extracts derived from plants of the genus Tabebuia exhibit potential applications in the search for new molecules with antiproliferative activity. Among the isolated molecules, the most evaluated correspond to β-lapachone (naphthoquinone); however, molecules with antiproliferative potential belonging to groups such as iridoids, flavonoids, quinones, furanonaphthoquinones, triterpenes, and polysaccharides have also been isolated and reported. Additionally, synthesized molecules have been evaluated on the basis of the modifications made to the structures of molecules isolated from the plant extracts to increase their activity, aiming to develop more potent antitumor agents for future clinical use.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the diffusion of spherical particles in a conical widening channel, with a focus on the effects of deterministic drift and entropic forces. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the motion of particles from a reflecting boundary to an absorbing one. Properties of diffusive motion are explored by inspection of mean squared displacement and mean first passage time. The results show that the diffusion type depends on the drift strength. Without the drift, entropic forces induce effective superdiffusion; however, the increasing drift strength can counterbalance entropic forces and shift the system to standard diffusion and then effective subdiffusion. The mean squared displacement exhibits bending points for high drift values, as predicted by one-dimensional theoretical considerations. The study underscores the importance of considering deterministic and entropic forces in confined geometries.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a sustainable, environmentally friendly synthetic route for the production of key intermediates in losartan using palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) derived from a brown seaweed, Sargassum incisifolium, as a recyclable nanocatalyst. A key intermediate, biaryl, was synthesized with an excellent yield (98%) via Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between 2-bromobenzonitrile and 4-methylphenylboronic acid, catalyzed using bio-derived PdNPs under mild conditions. Subsequent bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) under LED light, followed by imidazole coupling and tetrazole ring formation, allowed for the production of losartan with an overall yield of 27%. The PdNP catalyst exhibited high stability and recyclability, as well as strong catalytic activity, even at lower loadings, and nitrosamine formation was not detected. While the overall yield was lower than that of traditional industrial methods, this was due to the deliberate avoidance of the use of toxic reagents, hazardous solvents, and protection/deprotection steps commonly used in conventional routes. This trade-off marks a shift in pharmaceutical process development, where environmental and safety considerations are increasingly prioritized in line with green chemistry and regulatory frameworks. This study provides a foundation for green scaling up strategies, incorporating sustainability principles into drug synthesis.",

The adsorption breakthrough performance of the single-component SO2 or H2S was determined in the activated carbon fixed-bed test. Langmuir and extended Langmuir equations in the Aspen adsorption module were used to describe the adsorption equilibrium of the single and bi-component SO2 and H2S system, respectively. The effects of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and temperature on the dynamic adsorption process of the bi-component SO2/H2S system were investigated. The concentration distribution and adsorption capacity of SO2/H2S in the bed were simulated. The results showed that the simulation for the single-component breakthrough curves of SO2 or H2S agreed well with the experimental data. It indicated that the model and simulation yielded engineering acceptable accuracy. For the bi-component adsorption, the competitive adsorption effect was observed, with H2S as the weakly adsorbed component and SO2 as the strongly adsorbed component. The dynamic adsorption process showed the sequence of initial adsorption, breakthrough, replacement, and equilibrium. The breakthrough curves were characterized by the distinct hump (roll-up) for H2S, resulting from the replacement effect. The influence of GHSV and the temperature on the dynamic adsorption process were investigated, revealing that the lower velocity and temperature enhanced the adsorption. This work might be used for the design and optimization of adsorption bed for the simultaneous removal of SO2 and H2S in Claus tail gas.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin E is widely used in cosmetics and dermatological applications for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties, yet its industrial use is limited by poor stability and bioavailability. To address these challenges, this study developed zein-based microstructures encapsulating vitamin E using electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques and evaluated how zein concentration affects morphology and release behavior. The SEM analysis showed that biopolymer (zein) concentration significantly affects microstructure morphology. At low concentrations (1%, 5%, and 15% (w/v)), micro/nanoparticles are formed, and high concentrations (30% (w/v)) yielded only fibers. The average size of the structures produced with zein (1–15% w/v) ranged from 0.38 to 0.90 µm, as measured using the program ImageJ (v1.54d). Structures containing vitamin E were generally smaller than those without. For electrospun fibers made with 30% zein, diameters ranged from 0.49 to 0.74 µm, with vitamin E-containing fibers also being thinner. Conductivity also influenced morphology; higher conductivity developed fibers, while lower conductivity formed particles. The solution with 15% (w/v) zein + 1% (w/w) vitamin E showed a conductivity of 1276 μS, similar to the 15% zein solution (1280 μS), indicating that vitamin E addition had no significant effect on conductivity. Release assays revealed that structures produced with low zein concentrations led to immediate release, while structured made with higher concentrations, prolonged release. A preliminary cosmetic formulation test has been conducted. The vitamin E microstructures were successfully incorporated into aloe vera hydrogel and coconut oil to show their potential for cosmetic applications.",

The objective of this review was to compile the latest advances in the development of computational models capable of identifying drugs already registered by the Food and Drug Administration for other indications with potential capacity to be applied as antimicrobials. We present studies that apply in silico methods such as machine learning, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and deep learning. Some of these studies have in vitro/in vivo results that demonstrate the reliability of this computational methodology in terms of the identification of effective molecules and new targets of interest in the treatment of infections. In addition, we present the methods that are under development and their future prospects in terms of the search for new antimicrobials. We highlight the need to implement these strategies in the research of effective drugs in the treatment of infectious diseases and to continue to improve the available models and approaches to gain an advantage against the rapid emergence of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive technique—used for the local eradication of neoplastic cells—that exploits the interaction of light, oxygen, and a photo-responsive drug called photosensitizer (PS) for the local generation of lethal ROS. Push-pull chromophores, that bear electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups linked through a π-electron bridge, are characterized by a non-homogeneous charge distribution in their excited state, with charge transfer from one extremity of the chain to the other one (Internal Charge Transfer—ICT). This phenomenon has a direct impact on the photophysical features of the push-pull compounds, as the bathochromic shift of the emission maxima and intersystem crossing (ISC) of the excited state are directly connected with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In continuing our research regarding the synthesis and use of oligophenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) in PDT, two new push-pull glycosyl OPE-NOF and OPE-ONF—featuring electron-donor N,N-dimethylamino (N) and dimetoxyaryl (O) and acceptor tetrafluoroaryl (F) moieties on the OPE chain—have been efficiently prepared. The interchanged position of the D groups onto the conjugated skeleton was aimed to tune and optimize the push-pull effect, while the introduction of glucoside terminations was directed to give biocompatibility and bioaffinity to the chromophores. OPE-NOF, OPE-ONF, and the synthetic intermediates were fully characterized, and their photophysical properties were investigated by using UV-Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. OPE-NOF showed a strong charge-transfer character and high PDT effect on HeLa cancer cells when irradiated with non-harmful blue light, causing massive cancer cell death.",

    "abstract": "Quercetin (QUE) is a bioactive flavonoid that is naturally present in various fruits and possesses many pharmacological activities. Despite its health benefits, the bioavailability of quercetin is relatively low due to its crystalline form and hydrophobic structure. An approach to overcoming these drawbacks is its incorporation into amorphous polymer matrices. PLA and PLA/PEG fibrous materials loaded with QUE were obtained by electrospinning. The XRD analysis revealed a visible decrease in the crystallinity of QUE after its incorporation into PLA and PLA/PEG fibers. The obtained fibrous materials and, especially, the PLA/PEG mat loaded with the flavonoid exhibited high antioxidant activity due to the better wettability and higher release rate of the bioactive compound. Moreover, the PLA/QUE and PLA/PEG/QUE mats possessed antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, the antitumor activity of the prepared mats was tested against SH-4 cancer cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. The obtained results reveal that the QUE-loaded fibrous mats exhibited high anticancer activity against cancer cells but lower toxicity to normal keratinocytes. The combined antioxidant, antibacterial and in vitro antitumor activities render these novel PLA-based materials loaded with QUE promising candidates for wound dressing applications and for application in local tumor treatment.",

Our findings indicated that all three cyclodextrins form stable 1:1 inclusion complexes with dacarbazine. Among them, the complexes with HE-β-CD were the most thermodynamically stable. While the choice of solvent model had a minor impact on the structural properties of the complexes, it significantly affected thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and solvation free energy.

    "abstract": "Milk of lime (MOL), a suspension of calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide, is vital in the purification of sugar beet and cane juices. This study evaluates the application of Fourier Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric models—Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR)—for rapid, non-destructive assessment of key MOL parameters: density, total lime content, calcium oxide availability, and sucrose content. Ninety samples were analyzed using both wet chemistry and FT-NIR. The predictive performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2). High predictive accuracy was observed for density (PLS: R2 = 0.8274; PCR: R2 = 0.8795) and calcium oxide availability (PLS: R2 = 0.9035; PCR: R2 = 0.9115). Total lime content showed moderate accuracy (PLS: R2 = 0.7748; PCR: R2 = 0.7983), while sucrose content exhibited low predictive power (PLS: R2 = 0.2312; PCR: R2 = 0.3747). The weak performance was noted for %CaO (PLS: R2 = 0.4893; PCR: R2 = 0.2409), likely due to spectral overlap and matrix complexity. Despite these challenges, FT-NIR remains a viable, reagent-free method for monitoring MOL, with the potential to enhance process control in the sugar industry. Future work should focus on refining calibration strategies and addressing spectral interferences to improve predictive accuracy for complex matrices.",

As conventional methods of biofilm elimination may be ineffective, there is a need for safe and sustainable methods for A. acidoterrestris management. The objective of the study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of commercial essential oils derived from clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & Perry), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), and peppermint (Mentha piperita (L.) Huds.) against A. acidoterrestris. The effect of the essential oils on the mature biofilms of fifteen environmental A. acidoterrestris isolates subjected to variable pH values (3.0, 4.0, and 5.5), temperatures (25, 37, and 44 °C), and essential oil concentrations (0.5 MIC, MIC, and 2 MIC compared to planktonic cells) was studied. The essential oils showed significant antibiofilm activity against A. acidoterrestris isolates, with the efficiency of biofilm eradication depending on the strain and environmental parameters such as acidity, culture temperature, type, and concentration of essential oil. The greatest antibiofilm potential was observed for clove essential oil regardless of oil concentrations and environmental conditions. Cinnamon oil exhibited lower activity against the tested A. acidoterrestris strains. Peppermint essential oil showed the weakest antibiofilm ability and did not completely eradicate any strain biofilm of the tested strains. Clove and cinnamon essential oils have the potential to be effective alternatives to synthetic disinfectants directed against A. acidoterrestris grown in the form of biofilms.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the effects of varying ultrasound treatment durations (5, 15, 30, and 45 min) applied prior to osmotic dehydration in xylitol solutions on apple tissues were investigated. The efficiency of the osmotic dehydration process was assessed by analyzing its kinetic parameters. In selected samples of osmotically dehydrated fruits, physicochemical properties were evaluated, including dry matter content, total acidity, pH, sugar profile, color attributes, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity (measured by DPPH and ABTS assays), and vitamin C content. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the relationships among the measured variables and to identify underlying patterns within the dataset. Osmotic dehydration in xylitol significantly modified the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of apples, promoting substantial water loss and partial replacement of natural sugars with xylitol. The results showed that ultrasound pretreatment markedly influenced these effects, with treatment duration playing a critical role. Shorter ultrasound applications (15–30 min) enhanced xylitol uptake while better preserving antioxidant activity and color, whereas longer ultrasound treatments (45 min) achieved greater mass transfer but led to higher losses of bioactive compounds compared to untreated samples.",

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes have attracted interest as an antimicrobial material for wound healing and implant-associated infections due to their bactericidal activity without the use of antibiotics. Hydrogels are frequently used as a delivery system; however, most research uses photonic activation in the form of near-infrared (NIR) laser stimulation to cause rapid BP degradation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and a localized photothermal effect. For implant-coating applications, using NIR laser stimulation could be challenging in practice, especially for porous orthopedic implants. This article investigates whether BP nanoflakes, suspended in Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogels, remain effective against Staphylococcus aureus without photonic activation. The experimental results showed 89.4 ± 7.6% bacterial inhibition from BP nanoflakes at a 5120 µg/mL concentration via passive diffusion in F127; however, it could not kill all the bacteria present. It is hypothesized that the F127 gel interface could create a barrier between the bacteria, which continue to multiply in media, and the antimicrobial black phosphorus compound, which degrades in the F127.",

We previously reported a metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of selected Australian Terminalia spp. and highlighted numerous flavonoids that may contribute to the antimicrobial activities of those plants. This study examines the antibacterial activities of fifteen flavonoids found in Terminalia spp. against a range of gastrointestinal pathogens using broth dilution assays. Flavonoids were also combined with six different classes of conventional antibiotics to investigate interactions. The efflux pump inhibitory activity of the flavonoid was evaluated using ethidium bromide accumulation and efflux assays. Toxicities were assessed via human dermal fibroblast cell line assays. Fisetin, hispidulin, isoorientin, orientin, rutin, and vitexin showed noteworthy growth inhibitory activity (MIC values 62.5–250 µg/mL). Isoorientin and orientin were most potent against Bacillus cereus and Alcaligenes faecalis, displaying MIC values of 62.5 µg/mL against both bacteria. All flavonoids except genistein, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, taxifolin, and vitexin were nontoxic in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell proliferation assays. When individual flavonoids were combined with selected antibiotics, some potentiated the activity of these antibiotics. Two synergistic, eighteen additive and thirty-one non-interactive interactions were observed. The synergistic interactions were all observed in combination with orientin. Notably, orientin exhibited efflux pump inhibitory effects at concentrations from 15.26 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL. The findings reported herein indicate that the selected flavonoids have the potential for addressing bacterial antibiotic resistance and highlight the need for further study.",

    "abstract": "Metalloporphyrins, owing to their structural resemblance to natural enzyme active sites and highly tunable coordination environments, have emerged as promising catalysts for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation.",

This study aimed to characterize the phenolic profile of Corallodiscus flabellatus (or C. flabellata) and elucidate its mechanistic interactions with tyrosinase under high-altitude environments with intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Two novel phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and seven known compounds were isolated using silica gel, ODS, and preparative HPLC, with structures determined via NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and acid hydrolysis. Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) inhibition assays revealed divergent effects: compound 7 (containing a caffeoyl moiety) exhibited potent inhibition (IC50 = 0.23 μM), comparable to arbutin, while other PhGs displayed activation or biphasic responses. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compound 7 stabilized tyrosinase via π-π stacking with Phe264 and Cu²⁺ coordination, whereas activating compounds likely acted as substrates. These findings elucidate the dual regulatory function of PhGs, which activate tyrosinase to counteract acute ultraviolet-induced stress and inhibit its activity to attenuate oxidative overload, thereby advancing our understanding of alpine plant adaptation mechanisms.",

Separation was achieved using silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel, and structural elucidation was performed through advanced 1D and 2D NMR techniques, including HSQC, HMBC, and (IN)ADEQUATE. Due to kahweol’s instability, the research prioritized cafestol for the synthesis of rhodamine B conjugates. Initial ester-linked conjugates proved unstable, prompting the development of more robust derivatives through amide linkage strategies and further functionalization via acetylation and oxidation reactions. Some oxidation methods led to furan ring cleavage, impacting structural integrity. Selected compounds were tested for cytotoxicity using SRB assays on human tumor cell lines (MCF7, A2780) and non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). While the parent diterpenes and many derivatives showed minimal activity, several cafestol–rhodamine B conjugates demonstrated notable cytotoxic effects. Compound 6, in particular, exhibited selective activity against cancer cells with reduced toxicity toward non-malignant cells.",

Detailed analysis of the relaxation dynamics reveals that Raman processes dominate at higher temperatures, with systematic variations in relaxation parameters across the series.

SOD1 mutations have a significant role in the pathophysiology and fast behavior of protopathic proteins in ALS illness. The E100K mutation may be useful in uncovering the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1 associated with ALS. According to several studies, giving small molecule inhibitors made from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds may be a viable treatment strategy for neurological conditions. Using molecular docking and MD simulations, we have identified a potential flavonoid drug that may successfully inhibit SOD1’s amyloidogenic activity. Puerarin, Fisetin, and Peonidin provided intriguing pharmacological hints during the initial screening of flavonoids. The Fisetin-E100K complex had a larger residual energy contribution and substantial binding than other flavonoid compounds. The findings showed that, unlike other materials, Fisetin increased the structural stability, hydrophobicity, and flexibility of the mutant while reducing the amount of β-sheets. Furthermore, to distinguish aggregation in the mutant (unbound/bound) states, we displayed modifications in the free energy landscape (FEL). As a result, Fisetin was identified as having therapeutic potential against the E100K, which might make it a viable pharmacological option for the creation of inhibitors that lower the chance of ALS death.",

This study reports for the first time the implementation of the microbial dye violacein, obtained by Janthinobacterium lividum batch cultivation, as SERS probe, as a suitable substitutive to the most employed toxic chemical dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). The interaction of the proposed natural probe with the metal surface after the adsorption and the presence of local electromagnetic fields were evaluated by computational approach. The SERS devices developed were decorated by applying a single-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) decoration method and characterized using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The platform showed a remarkable sensitivity, achieving a detection limit of 10–7 M for violacein, allowing to point out the strong potential of this natural microbial dye as a sustainable probe molecule for low-concentration analytes detection on SERS-active substrates, making them suitable for several application fields, such as environmental monitoring, food safety, cultural heritage analysis and diagnostics.

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation plays a pivotal role in human semen, influencing various processes, such as spermatogenesis, maturation, sperm motility, capacitation, and fertilization. Despite its importance, the specific details regarding N/O-glycosylation within human semen proteins have largely remained unknown. To address this challenge, an integrated glycoproteomic platform (termed GlycoIP) was developed, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both intact N- and O-glycopeptides directly from human semen samples. Characterizing these intact glycopeptides is particularly challenging, yet it provides invaluable insights into the structure and function of both glycans and their attachment sites. In this study, our platform enabled the identification of 1,833 unique N-glycopeptides and 720 unique O-glycopeptides. This approach revealed extensive and precise site-specific N/O-glycosylation data, highlighting 438 potential O-glycosylation sites from 148 distinct O-glycoproteins. Notably, we conducted site-specific N/O-glycosylation profiling on several unique glycoproteins, including sperm equatorial segment protein 1 (SPESP1), which is located on human sperm, and plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), which is presented in both sperm and seminal plasma. In summary, this platform provides a promising approach for comprehensive profiling of protein site-specific N/O-glycosylation within a single experiment. This advancement paves the way for further functional studies on glycoproteins and their roles in male infertility, enhancing our understanding of this complex field.",

This study aimed to optimize the therapeutic potential of brevinin-1pl, a frog-derived AMP with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities.MethodsMajor experimental approaches encompassed antibacterial activity evaluation, hemolytic potential assessment, bactericidal rate determination via time-kill kinetics, SYTOX Green-based membrane integrity analysis, and MTT assays for anti-proliferative effects.ResultsSubstitutions with arginine (brevinin-1pl-2R and brevinin-1pl-5R) enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria but reduced efficacy against Gram-negative strains. Lysine substitution (brevinin-1pl-6K) decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria due to reduced hydrophobicity. In contrast, histidine substitution (brevinin-1pl-3H) showed diminished activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., MRSA MIC increased from 2 µM to 4 µM) but reduced hemolysis, indicating improved selectivity. Mechanistic studies using SYTOX green assays confirmed membrane disruption as a primary mode of action, while suggesting alternative mechanisms for Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The brevinin-1pl and its analogues demonstrated significant inhibitory efficacy against both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and H838 non-small cell lung cancer cells at a concentration of 10–4 M. Notably, brevinin-1pl-3H exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal HaCaT cells despite its high hydrophobicity, suggesting potential for dermatological applications.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that strategic amino acid substitutions can optimize the therapeutic potential of AMPs, offering a promising approach to develop peptides with enhanced efficacy and reduced clinical side effects.",

Meanwhile, its microscopic properties were tested by industrial analysis, mercury pressure method and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method.ResultsFirstly, non-focusing microwaves achieve more stable gasification despite comparable gas production durations. Secondly, focused microwaves enhance energy absorption and reduce coal moisture, while non-focusing radiation alters coal composition by increasing volatile matter and decreasing fixed carbon. Finally, non-focusing modes improve coal combustibility and reduce particulate emissions with minimal environmental impact, contrasting with focused microwaves limited ecological effects.

We have used two types of oxide nanoparticles, namely, Al2O3 and γ- Al2O3, with water and C2H6O2. The purpose of this study is to investigate an innovative comparative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid flow and heat transport with the impact of thermal radiation on water and ethylene glycol (EG) suspended with Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. A novel comparison of concentration of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ Al2O3–C2H6O2 nanofluids is investigated under the influence of chemical reactions. The system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was obtained via a similarity transformation and then solved using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) in Mathematica. The temperature and velocity profiles are obtained numerically for a range of controlling parameter values, including the volume percentage φ of nanomaterials, the magnetic effect parameter M, the radiation parameter Rd, and Eckert number Ec in convergent/divergent channels. The concentration profiles of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 tri-nanofluids are calculated numerically for governing parameter values, including those accounting for chemical reactions. The investigation’s findings indicate that there is greater heat transport in γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 and γ-Al2O3–H2O than in Al2O3–H2O. We have demonstrated that there is good agreement between the current results and those found in the literature for various values of the magnetic field parameter, thermal radiation parameter, and nanoparticle volume fraction.",

    "abstract": "Trifluoromethylation stands as a pivotal technology in modern synthetic chemistry, playing an indispensable role in drug design, functional material development, and agrochemical innovation. With the growing emphasis on green chemistry principles, the pursuit of environmentally benign trifluoromethylation strategies has emerged as a critical research frontier. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), characterized by its cost-effectiveness, stability, and low toxicity, has become a promising alternative to conventional trifluoromethylation reagents. This review systematically summarizes advancements in photocatalytic decarboxylative trifluoromethylation using TFA and its derivatives over the past decade, focusing on three key activation mechanisms: single-electron transfer (SET), electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-mediated pathways, and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This paradigm shift is driven by the intrinsic limitations of conventional thermal decarboxylation, particularly its reliance on harsh conditions and significant environmental burdens. In contrast, photocatalytic strategies enable efficient C–CF3 bond construction under mild conditions, offering a modular platform for synthesizing fluorinated functional molecules. Strategic research priorities should focus on overcoming fundamental challenges, including but not limited to optimizing photosensitizer catalytic efficiency, establishing regioselective manipulation strategies, and engineering multicomponent tandem reaction systems to achieve trifluoromethylation methodologies under mild conditions. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic investigations with artificial intelligence-driven reaction prediction will accelerate the advancement of precision trifluoromethylation technologies.

    "abstract": "IntroductionAlcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is a common consequence of chronic alcohol consumption, characterized by lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes play essential roles in metabolizing alcohol and other compounds. However, the specific long-term effects of alcohol on these enzymes remain unclear.MethodsThis study the examines influence of prolonged ethanol exposure on CYP450 activity and expression in AFLD using a rat model. Key enzymes such as CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1 were assessed in relation to lipid accumulation and oxidative stress.ResultsSignificant alterations were identified in the expression and activity of CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1, which were associated with increased lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Additionally, the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was elevated, suggesting that chronic alcohol intake may impact drug transport and excretion.DiscussionThese findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AFLD and highlight the potential of CYP450 modulation as a therapeutic target. By elucidating how long-term ethanol exposure disrupts hepatic CYP450 enzyme profiles, this research lays the groundwork for developing personalized therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients with AFLD.",

    "abstract": "Today, wastewater treatment is essential and inevitable due to the water crisis caused by climate change and population growth. Although numerous methods and synthetic compounds have been successful in practical and laboratory applications, developing novel multifunctional compounds remains of interest to scientists. For this purpose, a new nanofiber containing Cobalt-MOF (metal-organic framework), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which are known environmentally friendly polymers, was synthesized. After characterization and structure determination, the nanofiber was investigated for its ability to adsorb Congo Red dye and inhibit known microbial species in wastewater. This study showed that 91% of the 400 mg/L Congo red solution was absorbed by 0.06 g/L of the synthesized Cobalt-MOF/PVA-PVP Nanofibers at 1 h. Additionally, seven well-known strains (including Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Giardia lamblia) in wastewater were inhibited (with MIC of 8 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL) to the extent that some antibiotics could not affect them. This performance of the newly synthesized nanofiber can be attributed to its physical, chemical, and structural characteristics, such as compounds with biological properties present in its structure, as well as its high specific surface area. Therefore, researching and synthesizing similar compounds using the method presented in this study can lead to their development and application in wastewater treatment processes.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly efficient, recyclable adsorbents for heavy metal remediation remains a critical challenge in environmental engineering. This study introduces a novel cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized magnesium silicate (CTAB/MS) nano-adsorbent was synthesized through a multi-step surface modification of serpentinite involving intercalation with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol treatment, and CTAB incorporation. The resulting nanostructure was extensively characterized and applied for the removal of cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), and copper (Cu2+) ions from contaminated water. The characterization findings confirmed significant morphological and structural modifications, including enhanced surface area, functional group availability, and mesoporosity, which contributed to enhanced adsorption performance. The kinetic modeling confirmed that the process predominantly followed a pseudo-first-order model, suggesting that rapid physisorption mechanisms controlled the initial adsorption phase. Equilibrium studies revealed that adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous active sites, with maximum adsorption capacities of 491.9 mg/g (Cd2+), 481.8 mg/g (Co2+), and 434.3 mg/g (Cu2+) at 303 K. Furthermore, statistical physics-based isotherm model incorporating steric and energetic parameters provided deeper mechanistic insights. The adsorption energy (ΔE) values remained below 12.66 kJ/mol, confirming a predominantly physical adsorption process, while thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic and spontaneous nature, as evidenced by negative free enthalpy (G) and internal energy (Eint) values. The recyclability assessment demonstrated that CTAB/MS retained over 70% of its adsorption efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles, underscoring its long-term applicability in water treatment. This highlights the potential of CTAB/MS as an advanced, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for large-scale water purification.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAstragali Radix (AR) - Curcumae Rhizoma (vinegar processed, CR) herb pair was recorded in ‘YIXUE ZHONGZHONG CANXILU’ to treat colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Hedysari Radix (HR) was categorized under the AR entry in ‘SHENNONG BENCAO JING’. HR is still an alternative to AR paired with CR clinically in northwest China. Hedysari Radix Praeparata Cum Melle (HRPCM) is a product that HR fries with honey to enhance the therapeutic effect. However, the mechanism of HRPCM paired with CR (HRCR) in CAC needs to be further elucidated.MethodsHRCR-MIAS were prepared using the eversion intestinal sac method. UHPLC Q-Exactive-MS investigated the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. Then, the mechanism of HRCR in CAC mice was predicted based on network pharmacology analysis in combination with the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. The pharmacodynamic effects of HRCR-MIAS for SW620 colon cancer cells were invested in vitro. The efficacies of HRCR low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (HRCR-L, 3.413 g/kg; HRCR-M, 6.825 g/kg; HRCR-H, 13.650 g/kg) in CAC mice were explored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to assay The inflammatory factors levels, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum. The expressions of the intestinal permeability proteins, such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1, were detected via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Finally, the predicted signalling was verified by Western blot (WB).Results855 common components were identified in HRCR and HRCR-MIAS, and 25 specific components in HRCR-MIAS were pointed out. Based on network pharmacology analysis, the inflammatory response and the cross-linked MAPK signalling and NF-kB signalling were predicted to be the main reasons for HRCR in CAC. HRCR-MIAS inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, regulated the cell cycle progression, and restrained the SW620 cells’ ability to migrate and invade in vitro. The outcomes of the WB experiment exhibited that HRCR-MIAS inhibited the expression of key proteins such as MEKK1, RAS, ERK, IKB and NF-kB in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling pathway of SW620 cells. The study in vivo found that the different doses of HRCR recovered the loss of body weight, the shortened colon length, the increased tumour counts, the abnormal changes in spleen and thymus indices, the colonic lesions, the unbalanced inflammatory factors levels like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, and the down-regulated intestinal permeability proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Experimental validation by WB confirmed that HRCR inhibited the expression of the key proteins, including MEKK1 RAS, ERK, IKB, and NF-kB, in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling in CAC mice.DiscussionHRCR not only suppresses the process of colonic inflammation and improves intestinal permeability but also relieves CAC by inhibiting the activated MAPK/NF-kB signalling cascade to alleviate CAC.",

Pharmaceutical researchers are diligently striving to identify avariety of drugs that might effectively cure pneumonia.MethodWe are motivated to examine the quantitative structureproperty relationships (QSPR) of anti-pneumonia pharmaceuticals. We employed K-Banhatti topological descriptors and analyzed the findings to achieve this. For estimation of physicochemical properties of pneumonia treatment drugs we utilized linear, quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic regression analyses.Results and ConclusionThe drugs comprise linezolid, ceftabiprole, and clarithromycin, among others. Topological descriptors enable the exploration of the complexity, connectivity, and other essential attributes of molecules. The quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis of pharmaceuticals for illness treatment employing K-Banhatti topological descriptors is an economical approach utilised by pharmaceutical researchers. We performed a QSPR analysis on 20 anti-pneumonia drugs to ascertain the most precise predictions for five properties: enthalpy, flash point, molecular weight, molar volume, and molar refractivity, employing five K-Banhatti indices. To do this, we used linear, quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic regression analyses to find links between molecules and the physical and chemical properties of drugs used to treat pneumonia. Employing molecular descriptors and regression models to investigate chemical patterns is a cost-effective and theoretical methodology.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNatural dyes offer an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic colorants in textile processing. This study explores the sustainable dyeing of cotton, silk, and leather using pigment-rich extracts from Bixa orellana seeds, with a focus on process optimization and antibacterial efficacy.Materials and methodsUsing an array of extraction solvents [water, methanol, ethanol, ethanol: methanol (1:1)] and extraction techniques [direct heat (DH), ultrasonic water bath (USB), ultrasonic probe, (USP)], Bixa orellana seeds were utilized to produce a yellow-orange dye. The color strength of the extracted dye was investigated using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance wavelength. The functional groups identified in the extracted natural dye were described using an FTIR spectrophotometer.Results and discussionUsing methanol as the solvent and 5 g of seed at 60°C for 60 min, the highest color yield was observed in USB. Using the ultrasonic water bath dyeing method at 60°C for 40 min without using any moderant, cotton, silk fabric, and leather were effectively colored in a yellow-orange color. The L*, a*, and b* values of the dyed material treated using the USB approach were 80.95, 4.52, 75.35 for cotton, 88.65, -1.35, 62.85 for silk, and 79.55, 015.35, 66.45 for leather, respectively. Compared to the other bacterial reduction, 85.25% of the colored materials showed substantial antibacterial action against Staphylococcus sp. Vibrio sp. (76.69%), Pseudomonas sp. (75.83%), Klebsiella sp. (74.24%), and Micrococcus sp. (74.21%) were the following most prevalent bacteria. The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) measurements showed that leather and cotton treated with B. orellana seed dye had higher UV radiation shielding properties.",

    "abstract": "Epoxy zinc-rich coatings usually require high zinc content to ensure its anti-corrosion performance. However, excessive zinc powder content will reduce the mechanical properties of the coating, increase the economic cost, harm the environment, etc. Therefore, this paper aims to reduce the amount of zinc powder and improve the corrosion performance of epoxy zinc-rich coatings by introducing two kinds of conductive particle materials, conductive graphene-mica powder and conductive nickel. Conductive graphene was first loaded on mica powder and the obtained conductive graphene-mica powder and the conductive nickel were introduced to the epoxy zinc-rich coatings to partially replace zinc component. The anti-corrosion properties of the coating were systematically evaluated by EIS and salt spray test. The resulting epoxy zinc-rich coating with nickel powder or conductive graphene-mica demonstrates outstanding salt spray resistance, lasting up to 2,000 h, exhibiting superior anti-corrosion performance at reduced zinc content of 60% or 45% compared to conventional coatings with 70% pure zinc powder. This study introduces a novel conductive mica material and investigates conductive metal nickel additive, effectively reducing zinc content in epoxy zinc-rich coatings, which offers valuable insights for developing high-performance anti-corrosion coatings.",

However, reports of thermally stable dielectric switching behavior in molecularly tailored 2D lead‐free copper chloride perovskites are limited. In this work, we employed monofluoride substitution to successfully regulate the crystal symmetry to achieve high‐temperature structural phase transition and switchable dielectric responses in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 (2‐FEA = 2‐fluoroethylaminium). Fluorine substitution establishes intermolecular C─H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions among the organic cations, driving a symmetry‐breaking transition from the parent tetragonal (EA)2CuCl4 (EA = ethylaminium) to a monoclinic phase in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 but it maintains a 2D perovskite structure. Consequently, (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 undergoes an evident order‐disorder structural transition (P21/c‐Cmce) around 351 K accompanied by dielectric switching behavior. Besides, eye‐catching thermochromic behavior has been evidenced by variable‐temperature UV–vis spectra revealing a temperature‐dependent bandgap redshift. This finding establishes fluoride substitution as a powerful strategy for the molecular engineering of multifunctional materials while providing valuable insights for the rational design of stimuli‐responsive hybrid systems.",

Studies have demonstrated that CatS plays a pivotal role in antigen presentation and is associated with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity, positioning it as a potential target in related disorders. Consequently, the development of a selective and straightforward method for detecting CatS is crucial. In this study, we introduce a colorimetric approach utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and CatS‐specific peptides for the detection of CatS activity. The CatS enzyme cleavage peptides, PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2, can stabilize AuNPs in a hydrosaline solution without aggregation. Upon hydrolysis of PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 by CatS, the AuNPs aggregate with a color change from red to blue. After optimizing the size of the AuNPs and the concentration of the peptides, the limits of detection for CatS were both to be 10 nM, when PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 were used to protect the AuNPs. Therefore, this colorimetric assay, which employs peptides and AuNPs, enables not only a selective but also a simple detection of CatS, visible to the naked eye.",

Although LIBs' green revolution is in its infancy, it might prove to be a game‐changer in the battle against global warming. Because of this, they are suitable for incorporation in mobile devices, which often prioritize their portability and lightweight design. Therefore, important aspects of this review study have been emphasized, including, the LIBs eco‐innovative advancements, environmental implications, life cycle evaluation, recycling, and potential future research to mitigate these impacts.

    "abstract": "AbstractEnveloped viruses utilize membrane fusion to enter the host cell and cause viral diseases. Most conventional inhibitors are target‐specific and ineffective against broad‐spectrum viral infections. Therefore, the current scenario demands developing inhibitors to attenuate the membrane properties instead of targeting the viral proteins. In the present work, we have designed a new WD‐containing peptide (dmTG‐23) by introducing a WD repeat at the center of the peptide sequence using mTG‐23 peptide as a template and a 14‐amino acid peptide with seven WD repeats (WD‐14), and tested their efficacies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐induced fusion assay. Our findings show that both dmTG‐23 and WD‐14 prevent PEG‐induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol concentrations, with a higher effect for dmTG‐23. Moreover, we have compared our results with our previous observations on TG‐23 and mTG‐23 to evaluate the importance of the number and position of WD repeats in the peptide sequence to impart the highest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that three WD repeat‐containing dmTG‐23 shows the highest efficacy against the PEG‐induced fusion of SUVs by enhancing the membrane order at the acyl chain region. This result is significantly important in designing peptide‐based broad‐spectrum fusion inhibitors.",

It was shown that a larger strong Brønsted acidity enhanced the total aromatics formation with an increased light arenes content (especially at elevated WHSV). At low WHSV, excess Brønsted acidity leads to the declined aromatics yield due to its high cracking ability. On the contrary, a higher Lewis acidity and extensive mesoporosity promoted the heavier aromatics production accelerating the coke formation and shortening the catalyst lifetime. An improved aromatization performance and a prolonged durability of the zeolite catalyst were controlled by a balanced Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio and the ratio of WHSV to acid site concentration.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo elucidate the emergence and amplification of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral molecules and their assemblies, we designed positionally isomeric chiral V‐shaped Schiff base ligands and their corresponding bis(boron difluoride) complexes. The ligands were synthesized by condensing chiral cyclohexanediamine with either 1‐hydroxy‐2‐naphthaldehyde or 2‐hydroxy‐1‐naphthaldehyde, followed by complexation with boron difluoride (BF2) to yield CNB1 and CNB2, respectively. While the parent Schiff bases exhibited no CPL, BF2 coordination induced strong CPL signals in solution. Remarkably, upon aggregation in a mixed solvent system, CNB2 displayed enhanced and inverted CPL, whereas its isomer CNB1 showed attenuated emission. Through comprehensive characterization and singlecrystal analysis, we attribute this divergent behavior to distinct molecular packing modes: CNB2 forms tightly stacked aggregates with efficient π─π interactions, while CNB1 adopts a less ordered arrangement. This study establishes a clear correlation between subtle structural modifications, supramolecular packing, and CPL performance, offering a rational strategy for tailoring chiroptical properties through precise molecular design and controlled self‐assembly.",

This study presents a bifunctional imidazole‐functionalized Hf(IV)‐based metal–organic framework (MOF), 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesizing 1,4‐dihydropyridines (1,4‐DHPs), which are key moieties in the synthesis of drugs used for cardiovascular treatments. The solvent‐free activated form of 1, labeled as 1′ catalyzes both Biginelli and Hantzsch reactions under mild conditions. The Biginelli reaction using aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea proceeded at 80 °C in 0.5 h with a 99% yield, while the Hantzsch reaction with aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate occurred at room temperature in ethanol within 1 h, also achieving a 99% yield. Compound 1′ showed broad substrate compatibility in both reactions. Additionally, the MOF exhibited excellent sensing ability for the anticancer drug raloxifene (RLX), showing a fast turn‐off fluorescence response (within 5 s), a low detection limit (9 nM), and a high Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv, 2 × 106 M⁻¹), enabling sensitive detection in diverse environments, including wastewater and biofluids. Detailed investigations into catalytic mechanisms and detection capabilities provide valuable insights for advancing drug synthesis and analytical methodologies.

In this work, cellulose is derivatized with a thiol‐containing amino acid, cysteine, via two approaches to enhance silver anchoring by exploiting the high affinity between thiol groups and soft metals. The first method involves direct esterification to produce Cel‐Cys‐Est, while the second uses periodate oxidation to form dialdehyde cellulose (DAC), followed by linking with cysteine via a Schiff base reaction, creating DAC‐Cys. After confirming the successful cysteine derivatization using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the adsorption characteristics towards silver ions have been optimized for parameters like pH, adsorbent dosage, and ion concentration. The kinetic studies have shown the pseudo‐second‐order model for silver ion adsorption over both materials, while the isotherm studies have indicated Langmuir‐type monolayer adsorption. The silver‐loaded DAC‐Cys, having higher adsorption capacity, has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work highlights the versatility of cysteine‐derivatized cellulose as an effective, eco‐friendly material for silver ion sequestration and its promising application in antimicrobial domains.",

Mechanistic investigations revealed that the formation of stable metallogels is facilitated by a synergistic combination of multiple noncovalent interactions, including Zn(II)‐hydrazide coordination, solvophobic effects, and π─π stacking interactions. These dendritic metallogels exhibited intelligent stimuli‐responsive behavior, undergoing reversible gel–sol phase transitions in response to various external stimuli, such as temperature and chemical inputs. Furthermore, the dendritic metallogel, particularly in its xerogel form, demonstrated exceptional efficacy (>94% within 10 hours) and outstanding adsorption capacity (800 mg/g) in the removal of Hg2⁺ ions from aqueous solutions, highlighting its potential for environmental remediation applications.",

The direct esterification and amidation of thioester are achieved without using toxic and hazardous reagents and with minimal waste production. Significantly, direct amidation of thioester was exploited to achieve diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amides derived from various electron‐rich, electron‐deficient amines. It is noteworthy that different amino ester and amino alcohol derivatives also participated in the direct amidation reaction and delivered the corresponding amides in good yields.

To address this, here we report the synthesis of cysteine‐capped copper nanoclusters (Cys‐Cu NCs) in just 30 min under ambient aqueous conditions. The incorporation of γ‐cyclodextrin (γ‐CD) enhanced the stability and immediately amplified the photoluminescence of the nanoclusters by triggering aggregation‐induced emission (AIE), increasing their quantum yield from 0.15 to 0.24. The remarkable photoluminescence of γ‐CD‐assisted Cys‐Cu NCs (γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs) was selectively quenched by protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), enabling ultrasensitive detection with an exceptionally low limit of 70 pM. Stern–Volmer analysis revealed the underlying interaction mechanisms between γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs and PPIX. This precise detection of PPIX is critical for diagnosing and monitoring porphyrias and other heme‐related disorders. The method demonstrated excellent PPIX recovery in complex biological matrices, such as human serum and artificial urine, across a broad PPIX concentration range (0.5–10 µM), highlighting its applicability in real‐world systems. Additionally, the nanoclusters exhibited strong sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS), underscoring their potential for oxidative stress monitoring. These findings position γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs as a versatile, cost‐effective, diagnostic tool for clinical and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen-like light muonic ions, in which one negative muon replaces all of the electrons, are extremely sensitive probes of nuclear structure. Using pulsed laser spectroscopy, we have measured three 2\n            S\n            -2\n            P\n            transitions in the muonic helium-3 (μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            ) ion, an ion formed by a negative muon and bare helium-3 nucleus. This allowed us to extract the Lamb shift, the 2\n            P\n            fine structure splitting, and the 2\n            S\n            -hyperfine splitting in μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            . Comparing these measurements with theory, we determined the root-mean-square charge radius of the helion (\n            3\n            He nucleus) to be\n            \n              r\n              h\n            \n            = 1.97007(94) fm, in good agreement with the value from elastic electron scattering but a factor 15 more accurate. Our results represent benchmarks for few-nucleon theories and open the way for precision quantum electrodynamics tests in He atoms and ions.",

    "abstract": "Antagonistic activities of the 53BP1 axis and the tumor suppressor BRCA1-BARD1 determine whether DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by end joining or homologous recombination. We show that the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a central 53BP1 axis component, suppresses DNA end resection by EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex but acts by distinct mechanisms in restricting these entities. Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis.",

However, central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic. A lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. Here, we silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.",

Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts.

However, member states have thus far been unable to raise strong barriers against illicit bioweapons development. With rapid advancements in science and technology and the rise of biological weapons disinformation, improvements of the Convention are urgently needed. One way to reinforce the treaty is to consider an inspection mechanism that aims to disrupt illicit programs rather than detect them.",

We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.",

In marmosets, we identified a vector for each Purkinje cell (P cell) along which its spikes displaced the eyes. Two spikes in two different P cells produced superposition of their vectors. In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.",

We incorporated heteroprokaryotic diversity into the trait-based model along two axes: substrate lability and growth strategy. Using genetic sequences along three ocean transects, we compiled 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds and estimated their degree of optimization for rapid growth (copiotrophy). Data and model consistency indicated that gradients in grazing and substrate lability predominantly set biogeographical patterns, and we identified deep-ocean “slow copiotrophs” whose ecological interactions control the surface accumulation of dissolved organic carbon.",

This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration. We discuss conditions under which beneﬁts from skilled migration may outweigh costs and also describe potential research paths to inform policy.",

Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.",

However, the complexity of assembly pathways makes it highly challenging to unravel the nature of supramolecular dynamics in aqueous environments. Here we introduce a precise combinatorial titration methodology to probe in situ the assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PAs). This approach reveals a binary assembly mechanism governed by equilibrium between spheroidal micelles and β-sheet polymers. Weakening hydrogen bonding shifts the equilibrium towards micelles and decreases the internal structural order of filamentous polymers, promoting supramolecular dynamics. Extending this methodology to two-component copolymerization systems, we find a surprising tendency to form blocky nanostructures with reduced internal phase separation as the mismatch in peptide sequence decreases. Interestingly, while well-mixed copolymers acquire different dynamics, mismatched ones retain the characteristic supramolecular motion of their homopolymer counterparts. These critical insights into supramolecular dynamics offer strategies to tailor the dynamic functions of supramolecular nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The Wingless/Int-1 (WNT) signaling network is essential to orchestrate central physiological processes such as embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. In the currently held tenet, WNT/β-catenin signaling is initiated by WNT-induced recruitment of Frizzleds (FZDs) and LRP5/6 followed by the formation of a multiprotein signalosome complex. Here, we use bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to show that different WNT paralogs dynamically trigger FZD-LRP6 association. While WNT-induced receptor interaction was independent of C-terminal LRP6 phosphorylation, it was allosterically modulated by binding of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL) to FZD. WNT-16B emerged as a ligand of particular interest, as it efficiently promoted FZD-LRP6 association but, unlike WNT-3A, did not lead to WNT/β-catenin signaling. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed distinct transcriptional fingerprints of WNT-3A and WNT-16B stimulation in HEK293 cells. Additionally, single-molecule tracking demonstrated that, despite increasing FZD5 and LRP6 confinement, WNT-16B stimulation did not result in formation of higher-order receptor clusters, in contrast to WNT-3A. Our results suggest that FZD-WNT-LRP5/6 complex formation alone is not sufficient for the initiation of WNT/β-catenin signaling. Instead, we propose a two-step model, where initial ligand-induced FZD-LRP6 association must be followed by receptor clustering into higher-order complexes and subsequent phosphorylation of LRP6 for efficient activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling.",

So far, most of the reported work is conducted on metal substrates and relies on unconventional mechanisms, thereby precluding a direct transposition of well-established organic reactions from solutions to surfaces. In addition, the intrinsic properties and reactivity of metal substrates often limit the activation methods available to trigger on-surface reactions, and photoinduced processes are especially difficult to handle due to quenching of the adsorbed precursor molecules. Herein, the photoinduced deoxygenation of dibenzothiophene S-oxide (DBTO) derivatives is transposed from solutions to insulating alkali halide surfaces in ultra-high vacuum. By combining in-solution and on-surface investigations by means of scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, as well as bias spectroscopy measurements, we provide evidence of the successful on-surface deoxygenation of individual DBTO derivatives under UV irradiation. The photoinduced deoxygenation is conducted at low temperature (",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.",

While phosphate was likely the main phosphorus source for life during the Archean, phosphite (HPO3\n            2\n            −) gained importance leading up to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, the concentration of phosphite in seawater at that time, and the processes driving this shift in P utilization, remain poorly constrained. Using lab experiments and phosphite data from banded iron formations (BIFs), we show that hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) preferentially remove phosphate over phosphite. This suggests that shallow seawater at the onset of the GOE could have contained up to 0.17 µM phosphite, comprising 5–88% of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus. We propose that phosphate depletion driven by HFO adsorption and microbial competition may have promoted the use of phosphite as an alternative P source.",

Here, we present SubNetX, a computational algorithm that extracts reactions from a database and assembles balanced subnetworks to produce a target biochemical from selected precursor metabolites, energy currencies, and cofactors. These subnetworks can be integrated into whole-cell models, allowing the reconstruction and ranking of alternative biosynthetic pathways based on yield, length, and other design goals.

However, evolving new aaRS/tRNA pairs traditionally relies on a labor-intensive process that often yields aaRSs with suboptimal ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Here, we present an OrthoRep-mediated strategy for aaRS evolution, which we demonstrate in 8 independent aaRS evolution campaigns, yielding multiple aaRSs that incorporate an overall range of 13 ncAAs tested. Some evolved systems enable ncAA-dependent translation at single amber codons with similar efficiency as natural translation at sense codons. Additionally, we discover an aaRS that regulated its own expression to enhance ncAA dependency.

We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration.

    "abstract": "Action sequencing is fundamental to behavior. A critical decision for survival and reproduction is whether to repeat a current action or switch to a different one. However, the neural mechanisms governing action repetition and switching remain largely unknown. In mice trained to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we found that the M1-DLS circuit regulates action repetition, while the PrL-DMS pathway controls action switching. These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1-SPNs by M1 and D2-SPNs by PrL, respectively. In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD, the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL-DMS pathway was reversed, leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors. Genetic restoration of Shank3 in the DMS rescued both physiological and behavioral deficits. These findings reveal how the brain orchestrates action sequencing in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress exposure is a primary contributor to the development of anxiety disorders, closely associated with hippocampal dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr\n            607\n            site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS. Overall, our study reveals a previously undescribed anxiogenic effect of Rap1 and highlights it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stress-related mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Broadband photodetection, especially for the high-intensity pulsed lasers, has garnered increasing interest in photophysics and applied sciences driven by the development of pulsed lasers. However, direct broadband photodetection of high-intensity pulsed lasers, with precisely capturing their spatiotemporal properties, has been hampered by low saturation intensity or damage threshold of traditional optoelectronic materials. Here, we demonstrate that strategic enhancement of excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskite can enable robust high-order multiphoton absorption (MPA) optoelectronics with achieving strong four-photon absorption (4PA) and five-photon absorption (5PA) nonlinearities as well as efficient electronic properties simultaneously. This effectively overcomes the limitations of mainstream photodetectors. Our approach facilitates direct photodetection and high-precision imaging of high-intensity femtosecond lasers (21.5 GW/cm\n            2\n            ) across a broad wavelength range of 800 to 2300 nanometer. These results offer valuable insights into advancing high-order nonlinearity-based optoelectronics and provide practical solutions for direct measurement tools of intensive lasers, filling the blank of high-precision characterization of intense-field laser phenomena.",

Engineered living cells can redirect drug delivery systems to effectively reach targeted sites. Here, we used living macrophages as vehicles, attaching them with GeS nanosheets (GeSNSs) carrying β-elemene for transport to tumor sites. GeSNSs act as efficient sonosensitizers, enhancing ultrasound-induced reactive oxygen species generation for treating 4T1 breast tumors. Notably, macrophage hitchhiking delivery of β-elemene–loaded GeSNSs not only achieves high accumulation in tumor regions and suppresses tumor growth under ultrasound treatment, but also effectively remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by improving M1-like macrophage polarization and enhancing the populations of mature dendritic cells, CD4\n            +\n            , and CD8\n            +\n            lymphocytes, thereby facilitating enhanced sonodynamic chemoimmunotherapy.

Enhancing single-photon emission by engineering their photonic environment is essential for improving overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects. Our findings open the door for moiré flatband cavity–enhanced quantum light sources and quantum nodes for the quantum internet.",

However, it remains unclear whether the hippocampus drives the communication of predictions to sensory cortex or receives prediction signals from elsewhere. We collected 7-tesla fMRI data in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) while auditory cues predicted abstract shapes. Strikingly, neural patterns evoked by predicted shapes in CA2/3, pre/parasubiculum, and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were negatively correlated to patterns evoked by the same shapes when actually presented. Using layer-specific analyses, we ask: In which direction are predictions communicated between the hippocampus and neocortex? Superficial layers of the MTL cortex project to the hippocampus, while the deep layers receive feedback projections. Informational connectivity analyses revealed that communication between CA2/3 and PHC was specific to the deep layers of PHC. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates predictions through pattern completion in CA2/3 and feeds these predictions back to the neocortex.",

Here, we explore the use of amphiphilic nanoporous polymer-infiltrated nanoparticle films that condense and release liquid water under isothermal and undersaturated conditions. By tuning the polymer fraction and nanoparticle size, we optimize condensation and droplet formation. As vapor pressure increases, voids fill with condensate, which subsequently exudes onto the surface as microscopic droplets. This behavior, enabled by a balance of polymer hydrophobicity and capillarity, reveals how amphiphilic nanostructures can drive accessible water collection.

GLF-MINFLUX allowed live-cell single-protein tracking with 7.8-nanometer precision at ~200-microsecond temporal resolution, revealing distinct diffusion behaviors and rates between the basal membrane and filopodia.

After printing, the structures were heated to high temperatures in air to remove organic components and convert the remaining material into silica glass. 3D glass PhCs with periodicities as small as 260 nanometers were obtained after sintering at 650°C. The 3D glass PhCs exhibit ~100% reflectance in the visible range, surpassing the typical reflectances observed from similar structures in low–refractive index materials.

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes acquire essential nutrients primarily through adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) importers, consisting of an adenosine triphosphatase, a permease, and a substrate-binding protein. These importers are highly underrepresented in proteomic databases, limiting our knowledge about their cellular copy numbers, component stoichiometry, and the mechanistic implications of these parameters. We developed a tailored proteomic approach to compile the most comprehensive dataset to date of the\n            Escherichia coli\n            “ABC importome.” Functional assays and analyses of deletion strains revealed mechanistic features linking molecular mechanisms to cellular abundances, colocalization, and component stoichiometries. We observed four to five orders of magnitude variation in import system abundances, with copy numbers tuned to nutrient hierarchies essential for growth. Abundances of substrate-binding proteins are unrelated to their substrate binding affinities but are tightly yet inversely correlated with their interaction affinity with permeases. Counterintuitive component stoichiometries are crucial for function, offering insights into the design principles of multicomponent protein systems, potentially extending beyond ABC importers.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin regulation relies on “writer” enzymes that add posttranslational modifications to histone proteins. Variant polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are “writers” of ubiquitylation on histone H2A K118 and K119, crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.",

Building upon a global lipidomic study showing temperature-driven lipid unsaturation regulation in marine plankton, we expanded the analysis spatially and methodologically to investigate the in situ adaptations of marine plankton. Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples, we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co-occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions. The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans, where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation. Conversely, in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans, plankton showed enrichment in non-phosphorus lipids, likely responding to warm temperature, with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump. In the subsurface of these regions, highly unsaturated lipids were enriched, suggesting phytoplankton adaptation to low light and contributing unsaturated fatty acids to tropical and subtropical ocean food webs.",

A limitation of neochromosomes is their low and unpredictable transmission rates due to trisomy. Here, we report that selecting for dicentric recombinants through male crosses uncovers stabilized chromosome 4 fission events, which split it into 4a-4b complementary chromosome pairs, where 4a carries a native centromere and 4b carries a synthetic one. The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22.",

As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2\n            hi\n            TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance.

Recently, chaotic modulational instabilities (MIs)—a state far from equilibrium—have been exploited for parallel ranging and random number generation. Despite theoretical predictions suggesting unconventional wave statistics in chaotic MI, its rapidly varying temporal waveforms have prohibited direct experimental assessment. Here, we use a frequency-agile optical frequency comb to coherently interrogate the optical field within the microresonator in both temporal and spectral domains. In the chaotic regime, we observe transient events characterized by extremely high optical intensity, identified as rogue waves based on the long-tailed distribution of peak powers. Statistical analysis of many rogue wave events reveals their origin as pulse collisions. Our full-field measurement further unveils universal correlated photon transport that determines the collision process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Oxidative addition most commonly involves the addition of a substrate to a metal centre. This reaction is fundamental across synthetic chemistry and underpins numerous catalytic methods. In the textbook description of oxidative addition reactions, a net increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal occurs with simultaneous bond breaking at the substrate. The majority of known oxidative addition reactions, however, involve substrates bearing relatively electronegative elements (for example, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and halogens) and there has been little discussion of how addition processes may fundamentally change if substrates were constructed from more electropositive elements. Here we show that the zinc–zinc bonded complex, Cp*ZnZnCp* (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), which is isoelectronic with dihydrogen, undergoes facile addition to the metal (or semi-metal) centres of a series of main group carbene analogues based on silicon, aluminium, gallium or indium. Reactions proceed with complete breaking of the zinc–zinc bond and an increase in the coordination number of the central metal from two to four. Our analysis suggests that these addition processes are not oxidative, but rather there is likely a continuum of redox outcomes spanning oxidative, redox neutral and reductive. The addition of Cp*ZnZnCp* to silicon(II) provides the most compelling case for a prototypical reductive addition process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Nitrogen atoms are integral components of various chemical functional groups, including amines, amides and N-heterocycles, among others. Consequently, they play an important role in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, materials and commodity chemicals. The formation of C–N bonds is reliably achieved through methods, such as reductive amination, N-alkylation and cross-coupling. Hydroamination, starting with alkenes, presents a valuable alternative for accessing organic compounds containing nitrogen, as alkenes are highly abundant. Here we present a method for the iron-catalysed radical hydroamidation of alkenes. To this end, we developed a radical amidation reagent that can be readily prepared on a large scale, facilitating the efficient transfer of the synthetically valuable cyanamide functionality across both activated and unactivated double bonds. The scope of the reaction is remarkably broad, demonstrating its applicability to the diastereoselective hydroamidation of complex terpene natural products. Importantly, the synthesis of 15N-labelled amines is possible using this strategy. Subsequent chemistry, converting the distinctive cyanamide functionality into other useful groups, further validates the value of the developed methodology.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment remains a critical area of research. In this study, we investigated the potential of molecular hybridization to enhance the anticancer activity of existing molecules with previous demonstrated activity. In this sense, a series of hybrids combining key pharmacophores (melatonin and coumarin) were synthesized for the first time and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic/spectrometric techniques. To verify if this strategy improves biological potential, compounds were evaluated in SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Our results demonstrated that hybrid 3f exhibited activity comparable to conventional chemotherapy with 5‐Fluorouracil (GI50‐3f = 30.12 ± 2.12 µM; GI50‐5FU = 28.83 ± 3.61 µM), suggesting it could be a promising alternative for cancer drug research. Notably, the hybrids 3e and 3f displayed significantly higher inhibition percentages against this cell line regarding parental compounds, even causing total growth inhibition and a certain grade of lethality, highlighting the efficacy of molecular hybridization in potentiating biological effects. In addition, a theoretical examination of pharmacokinetics, toxicological, and drug‐like characteristics indicates that the most promising hybrid, 3f, has a good chance of advancing to additional preclinical studies. Our findings showed that melatonin‐coumarin conjugates are effective, with the 2‐hydroxyphenyl‐substituted conjugate serving as a prototype for further drug investigations addressed to combat colorectal malignant carcinoma (CRC). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential of coumarin/melatonin hybrids against cancer, emphasizing the need for further studies to optimize their activity and explore underlying mechanisms of action.",

For this purpose, the surface of the electrode was modified by electrochemical precipitation of cerium oxide at a temperature of 60 °C. The effect of different parameters, such as temperature, electrodeposition potential, pH, buffer type, and concentration of cerium in the preparation of the electrochemical sensor were investigated. Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles were also characterized by different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Increasing the current and minimizing the over potential of caffeine on the glassy carbon electrode modified with cerium oxide nanoparticles are the main advantage of the designed sensor. Under optimal conditions, the oxidation peak currents were proportional to caffeine concentration in the range of 10–368 µM with a low detection limit of 2.9 µM. The modified CeO2/GC electrode has high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and a larger active surface area than a bare glassy carbon electrode and fast response. Finally, the analytical efficiency of the proposed modified electrode was evaluated for the determination of caffeine in some real samples.",

In this study, nanoscaled ZnO NPs (denoted as sn‐ZnO NPs) were synthesized under ambient conditions using a biomimetic approach with Sambucus nigra (black elderberry) fruit extract as a natural reducing and capping agent, and zinc acetate dihydrate as the precursor. Morphological, structural, and optical characterizations including FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, and UV–visible spectroscopy confirmed the successful synthesis of hexagonal wurtzite‐structured nanoparticles with an average size of 53 ± 10 nm. The influence of calcination temperatures (500–700 °C) on the structural and optical properties of the nanoparticles was systematically examined. Higher calcination temperatures increased crystallite size and bandgap energy ranging from 1.67 eV (as‐synthesized) to 2.67 eV (700 °C). The nanoparticles demonstrated significant in vitro anticancer activity against SH‐SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with the 600 °C sample exhibiting the highest cytotoxicity achieving an IC50 value of 9.48 µg/mL. These eco‐friendly, biocompatible sn‐ZnO NPs with tunable structural and optical properties demonstrate strong potential for biomedical applications particularly in targeted cancer therapy and lay a foundation for further research into their use in diverse biomedical and environmental fields.",

This paper describes effective synthesis and properties of the first nitronyl nitroxide carrying an additional redox‐active phosphine group, namely 1,3,5,7‐tetramethyl‐8‐(4,4,5,5‐tetramethyl‐4,5‐dihydro‐1H‐imidazole‐3‐oxide‐1‐oxyl‐2‐yl)‐2,4,6‐trioxa‐8‐phosphaadamantane. This phosphinonitronyl nitroxide was prepared by reacting lithiated nitronyl nitroxide with 8‐bromo‐1,3,5,7‐tetramethyl‐2,4,6‐trioxa‐8‐phosphaadamantane. The paramagnet was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electron spin resonance (ESR), infrared, and UV/vis spectroscopy supported by quantum chemical calculations. Molecular and crystal structure of the phosphinonitronyl nitroxide was established by X‐ray structural analysis. ESR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved spin delocalization onto the phosphorus atom. According to the cyclic‐voltammetry data, oxidation of the phosphinonitronyl nitroxide takes place quasi‐reversibly at E1/2 = 0.76 V, and its reduction occurs chemically and electrochemically reversibly at E1/2 = −0.95 V (rel.

    "abstract": "AbstractTransition metal oxides such as nickel oxide (NiO) have garnered significant attention for supercapacitor applications due to their high surface area and excellent chemical stability. In this study, NiO nanocrystals were successfully synthesized using four different concentrations of NaOH (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M), yielding samples designated as NiO‐A, NiO‐B, NiO‐C, and NiO‐D, respectively. The structural and morphological characteristics of the synthesized samples were thoroughly investigated. Among them, NiO‐A exhibited superior crystallinity, as confirmed by X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that NaOH concentration significantly influenced the morphology of the nanocrystals. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of Ni in the + 2‐oxidation state in NiO‐A. Electrochemical performance was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge‐discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). NiO‐A demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 165 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, attributed to its large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 462 m2/g, pore volume of 0.49 cc/g, and low charge transfer resistance of 65.13 Ω. Additionally, GCD analysis revealed an energy density of 3.2 Wh/kg at a power density of 1870 W/kg, highlighting NiO‐A's potential as a promising electrode material for high‐performance supercapacitors.",

Native biomass and prepared composite were employed to optimize the pH in batch mode, while in continuous mode, parameters like flow rate, bed height, and bisphenol A concentration were optimized, and outcomes were illustrated in breakthrough curves. The maximum biosorption capacity with PH and PPY‐PH is 5.17 and 6.25 mg/g, respectively, at a bed height of 4 cm and a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min. The results exhibited that the maximum biosorption capacity for PH and PPY‐PH was observed at a bed height of 4 cm, a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min, and bisphenol A concentration of 45 ppm.

Chemical structural modification is an important strategy to solve molecular properties. More than 386 molecules have been derived from emodin, and most of them were found with improved activities. In the present review, we summarized all the emodin derivatives and their corresponding biological activities with the aim to provide a better understanding of research progress on structural modifications of emodin, as well as beneficial advancements for its further development.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA novel composite material, Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2, was successfully synthesized by integrating acid‐treated graphitic carbon nitride (Ac‐gC3N4) with tamarind shell‐structured TiO2 (TSS‐TiO2), prepared via thermolysis followed by solvothermal synthesis. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including FT‐IR, XRD, TGA, BET, FESEM, and XPS, confirmed the successful formation and structural features of the composite. The adsorption performance of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 for uranium(VI) removal from aqueous solutions was systematically investigated using batch experiments. The composite exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics and reached equilibrium within 60 min for an initial U(VI) concentration of 25 mg/L at pH 6.0. The adsorption performance of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 demonstrates a superior adsorption capacity of 370.3 mg g‐1, as described by the Langmuir isotherm model, compared to previously reported similar nanomaterials and nanocomposite adsorbents. The enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic interactions between the U(VI) species and the surface functional groups (amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl) of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2. Thermodynamic studies revealed that uranium adsorption on Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 increased with increasing temperature. The composite demonstrated a higher affinity in the presence of competing electrolytes and various metal ions, exhibited excellent regeneration using dilute nitric acid, and maintained its adsorption efficiency over multiple cycles. These results establish Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 as a sustainable and high‐performance adsorbent for U(VI) remediation in real‐world water treatment applications.",

Thus, obtained BJ‐CuO NPs were characterized using TEM, EDX, Raman spectra, DLS, zeta potential, UV–vis, FTIR, XRD, and SEM techniques. XRD analysis revealed monoclinic structure with 18 nm crystallite size. SEM studies confirmed the spherical morphology of produced BJ‐CuO NPs, further supported through TEM analysis (17.67 ± 5.45 nm). Raman spectra showed peaks at 292, 340, and 626 cm−1, which is attributed to Raman active modes for Cu–O stretching (Ag + 2Bg). The stability of the colloidal suspension was proved through DLS analysis with zeta potential value of −34.5 mV. The BJ‐CuO NPs had shown significant biological activities with IC50 values in µg/mL, namely, i) antioxidant (72.21), ii) anti‐inflammatory (77.77), and iii) antidiabetic activity (71.36). Further, the cytotoxicity studies on A549 and MCF‐7 cell lines through MTT test reveals moderate effect with IC50 values of 40.68 and 86.62 µg/mL. On screening BJ‐CuO NPs for antibacterial and antifungal activity against various strains, it shows significant activity with E. coli (18 ± 0.30) and A. Niger (18 ± 0.61).

A range of analytical techniques are employed to inform the study, including 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, viscosity evaluation, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP‐OES). Thermogravimetric analysis in combination with evolved gas analysis is used to assess thermal stability in both nitrogen and air environments. Furthermore, microscale combustion calorimetry is employed to examine flammability characteristics.

This study explores riboflavin (VB2) as a potential antimicrobial agent against S. aureus using in silico molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum chemical analyses. Molecular docking identified VB2's strong binding affinity to critical bacterial targets, including dihydrofolate reductase (2W9S) and the ABC transporter (6XJH), with binding affinities of −10.68 kcal/mol and −10.04 kcal/mol, respectively, alongside significant hydrogen bonding. MD simulations confirmed the stability of these complexes, with 2W9S‐VB2 showing an RMSD of 1.6 Å over a 100 ns trajectory, indicating robust interaction stability. Quantum chemical calculations provided additional insights into riboflavin's electronic properties, highlighting its chemical stability and strong interaction potential. These findings suggest that VB2 might serve as an effective inhibitor against S. aureus, paving the way for future experimental validation and optimization to address the growing challenge of antibiotic‐resistant pathogens.",

Modifying the vesicle corona by incorporating ionizable groups in the polymer chain can impart defined pH‐sensitivity. In this study, in situ PCN with various compositions of m‐Kaol with styrene and anionic acrylic acid were synthesized and characterized. PCN formed with 60:40 molar ratio of the monomers with m‐Kaol showed self‐assembly in THF into giant vesicles of 1.5–3.0 µm diameter and wall thickness of 50–70 nm, attributed to the functionalization‐induced bilayer assembly of the delaminated, m‐Kaol, Janus nanoparticles by hydrogen bonding involving terminal ─OH groups along the core and stabilized by the π─π interactions of the phenyl moiety along the periphery. Aliphatic rhodamine dye‐encapsulated vesicles showed no release in pH 4.0 indicating the hydrogen bonded carboxyl groups in the corona. Sustained delivery was observed at pH 7.4, attributed to the limited deprotonation leading to diffusion‐controlled release. The vesicles eroded completely at pH 9.0 due to the collapse of the hydrogen bonding. The results showed prospects for applications of these rigid, designer hybrid vesicles which are nontoxic and cost‐effective as pH‐sensitive delivery systems in the gastrointestinal tract or as scaffolds for topical delivery.",

Hence, we designed a new set of spirooxindole‐ and spiroindenoquinoxaline‐derived pyrrolo[3,4‐c] pyrroles that have been synthesized through atom economic one‐pot multicomponent reactions of isatin/indenoquinoxaline and phenylalanine to form an azomethine ylide with maleimide derivatives as dipolarophiles through 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of azomethine ylides. The newly synthesized compounds were structurally characterized using FT‐IR, ¹H, and ¹3C NMR spectroscopy, and their stereochemistry was unambiguously confirmed through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations of selected compounds (4b and 5a) revealed favorable binding interactions with the Mtb enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl‐β‐D‐ribofuranose oxidoreductase, suggesting their potential role in inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. In vitro anti‐tubercular activity was evaluated using the MABA assay against the H37Rv strain, with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol as positive controls. Among the synthesized analogs (4a–4d, 5a–5d), compounds 4d and 5d, bearing a 4‐chloro substituent, showed the most potent activity (12.5 µg/mL), while others exhibited notable inhibitory effects, indicating strong therapeutic potential.",

Herein, a novel g‐C3N4 layer‐coated CoN‐MoN fiber electrocatalyst was prepared on Co foam (CF) via thermopolymerization nitriding strategy. During the fabrication process, CoN‐MoN fiber was prepared facilely on CF, and, meanwhile, a g‐C3N4 layer was successfully coated on CoN‐MoN fiber. The synthesized electrocatalyst (g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF) exhibits a low overpotential of 138 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope (89 mV dec−1) during alkaline HER. The high water splitting capacity could be attributed to the special g‐C3N4 coating structure on the CoN‐MoN fiber. From DFT calculation, an obvious electron transfer occurred at the g‐C3N4/CoN‐MoN interface, which not only improves the hydrolytic dissociation ability but also optimizes its Gibbs free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*). Compared with the ΔGH* of g‐C3N4 and CoN‐MoN/CF, g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF showed a suitable ΔGH* of −2.97 eV, which is relatively close to the ideal ΔGH* (0 eV). Moreover, the H─O─H bond angle of adsorbed water on g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF increased to 105.47°, and the H─O bond was extended to 1.009 Å, which facilitates the breaking of the H─O bond, thus reducing H* to H2.",

We observed that effective interaction of NaC in Pluronic P123 at different temperatures (2–25 °C) reduces the overall fluorescence intensity of 1‐NaP. However, the sol to gel transition temperature remains unaffected in presence NaC at low concentration. MCR‐ALS analysed fluorescence spectra of 1‐NaP indicated that the relative contribution of anionic peak increases and neutral peak decreases in presence of NaC in Pluronic P123. This is due to the fact that hydration in the Pluronic P123 microenvironment increases by the charged interfacial region of NaC. Fluorescence life time data suggested that 1‐NaP is distributed mostly in polymer‐water interface and core region of Pluronic P123 experiencing relatively polar microenvironment with restricted diffusive motion.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe tandem solar cell (TSC) with top and bottom sub‐cells is able to absorb sunlight from visible to near infrared range and is promising for enhancing the photo‐conversion efficiency. We have proposed a TSC with a bandgap of 1.8 and 1.29 eV for carbon nitride (C2N) as a top sub‐cell and tungsten disulfide (WS2) as a bottom sub‐cell absorber layer, respectively. In this research study, 1D solar capacitance simulation software (SCAPS‐1D) is used to analyze the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and photo‐conversion efficiency (ƞ) of the top and bottom sub‐cell for the design of two‐terminal (2‐T) C2N‐WS2 TSC. The current matching condition of Jsc has been determined at the absorber layer thickness of 450 and 790 nm for the top and bottom sub‐cells, respectively. The TSC device parameters such as defect density and doping density have been optimized at 1015 (C2N), 1014 (WS2) cm−3, and 1017cm−3 (C2N and WS2), respectively for achieving better performance of the proposed structure. The determined optimum values of Voc, Jsc, ƞ, and FF are 2.38 V, 17.40 mA, 37.60%, and 90.78%, respectively. The present research paves the path for the realization of the high efficiency TSC.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study presents a microwave‐assisted, metal‐free approach for the fast and selective synthesis of pyridine‐functionalized N‐heterocyclic ligand precursors. Efficient synthetic methods are important in ligand development for fast and cost‐effective synthesis of transition metal complexes commonly used as catalysts in various applications. Traditional methods for forming C–N and C–C bonds require long reaction times and harsh conditions, whereas microwave heating accelerates synthesis by significantly reducing time and temperature, under metal‐ and additive‐free conditions. This has enabled the selective synthesis of mono‐ and di‐substituted pyridine‐based ligand synthons starting from 2,6‐dibromopyridine as well as 2,6‐dichloropyridine. The approach also applies to other pyridine‐based substrates, delivering high‐purity ligands in 5–15 min. Notably, this method provides an alternative approach to cross‐coupling reactions, eliminating the requirement for copper catalysts, and provides a more sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional cross‐coupling strategies. The ligand synthons prepared using the microwave‐assisted approach reported here have been utilized to prepare some common ligands used in the preparation of organometallic complexes.",

However, information about the biodegradability of PEF is currently lacking, and further studies under realistic natural conditions are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the biodegradability of PEF. In this study, we first demonstrated that PEF is marine biodegradable based on the results of laboratory tests using the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) test method using seawater at the coast of Osaka Bay, Japan. BOD tests revealed a 40% biodegradation of PEF within 90 days. The BOD curve followed a sigmoidal pattern, indicating an initial induction period. This behavior, typical of biodegradable polymers, suggests the presence of enzymes and bacteria capable of hydrolyzing PEF. Additionally, adjusting the length of the methylene chain in furan‐containing polyesters can regulate their biodegradability. These findings hold promise for developing biodegradable polymer building blocks and advancing biobased, biodegradable polymer technology.",

    "abstract": "Developing resilient and robust electrocatalysts devoid of noble metals is vital for facilitating the generation of O2/H2 from water electrolysis, particularly in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. Nickel‐based catalysts have attracted as part of global efforts to produce hydrogen from urea‐rich wastewater due to their high reaction rates and favorable long‐term stability. Two new mononuclear NiII‐embedded complexes, namely, [C26H38NiN4O4] (Complex 1) and [C24H32NiF2N4O2] (Complex 2), are explored as a bifunctional catalyst for the OER and UOR herein. Complexes 1 and 2 crystallize in triclinic and monoclinic with space group 1 (2) & P 21/c (14), respectively. The OER outcomes of Complex 1 exhibit excellent performance, featuring a lower overpotential of 220 mV and reduced Tafel slope value of 82 mV dec−1 at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH compared to Complex 2. Additionally, the results of UOR indicate that Complex 1 only requires 1.30 V potential to achieve the same current density which is significantly lower than other counterparts and most reported materials. Chronopotentiometry analysis reveals that Complex 1 is stable up to a longer period of 100 and 20 h in 1 M KOH and alkaline urea electrolyte, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis are typically developed by combining separate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts to form composites, often requiring complex synthesis methods. In this study, a simplified approach is presented by mechanical blending of BaSr2CoTiSbO9 (BSCTS), an OER catalyst, with BaSr2MnTiSbO9 (BSMTS), an ORR catalyst, to construct a composite bifunctional electrocatalyst. The density‐functional theory calculation supports superior ORR activity of BSMTS due to an uplifted Mn d‐band center than the Co d band and its proximity to the Fermi level, whereas the greater OER activity of BSCTS is due to the uplifted O 2p band center. While microstructural similarity of BSCTS and BSMTS facilitates efficient mixing for composite formation, the mechanical blending avoids intervention of complex synthesis procedures. The resulting bifunctional composite electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent performance with a bifunctional index of 0.72 V and a peak power density of 125 mW cm−2 when used as an air–cathode electrocatalyst in Zn–air battery (ZAB). This approach underscores the importance of mechanical blending of microstructurally compatible OER and ORR catalysts in designing practical bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs.",

    "abstract": "Functionalized quinones are crucial structural building blocks for synthesizing significant biologically active compounds. The selective catalytic oxidation of low‐valent oxygen precursors (including aromatic compounds, phenolic derivatives and hydroquinone analogues) has been widely recognized as one of the most economically and environmentally favorable approaches for producing functionalized quinones. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as versatile inorganic clusters, have attracted much attention in multidisciplinary fields, especially in catalysis, due to their adjustable structural configuration and acid‐base properties, excellent redox properties, as well as remarkable thermal stability, chemical stability and hydrolysis stability. As a pivotal branch, POM‐based heterogeneous catalytic systems not only preserve the inherent highly active sites of POMs, but also establish synergistic catalytic networks through the integration of hybrid components. This paves a new way for achieving material recyclability and green catalytic technology. This review presents a critical analysis of research advances in POM‐based heterogeneous catalysts for quinone synthesis over recent decades and systematically proposes optimization strategies from the perspective of material design principles and catalytic processes, aiming to offer molecular engineering theoretical support for the construction of a new generation of catalytic platform.",

In long‐term observations in the Norwegian Museum of Music, Ringve and Rockheim (Museums of Southern Trøndelag), local contact corrosion is documented on metal strings of plucked instruments when mounted close to cellulose nitrate (CN). The investigated strings are iron‐based alloys, in some cases covered with a tin coating. In the gas mixture emitted from CN, the presence of corrosive compounds, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carboxylic acids, is confirmed by an electrochemical NO2‐sensor and gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry. The corrosion product on the strings consists of iron oxide nitrate hydroxide hydrate, Fe2(NO3)O(OH)3(H2O), and goethite, α‐FeOOH, detected with X‐ray diffraction, Raman, and infrared spectroscopy. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, used to investigate the surface of tin‐coated corrosion products, showed the presence of adsorbed organic nitrogen. The formation of corrosion products is dominated by organic acids and moisture. The presence of nitrate in the corrosion product proves the involvement of nitrogen oxides in the corrosion mechanism. This analytical study highlights a dilemma for preserving material combinations in musical instruments and provides a basis for further research in conservation practice.",

Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including 18O2 isotopic labeling experiment, unequivocally establish a two‐step reaction pathway proceeding through a 1‐phenylethanol intermediate.

Herein, this possibility is investigated by evaluating the reactivity of a simple DQ salt toward amino acids and Cys‐containing peptides in neutral aqueous media. The results show that the DQ salt selectively forms adducts with free Cys and Cys residues in peptides. It is also demonstrated that the DQ salt effectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase, which contains a Cys residue in its active center. These results indicate that the DQ ring could serve as a new reactive group capable of Cys modification for biochemical and pharmaceutical applications.",

Since the 1970s, street art has become an influential cultural movement with significant artistic and social impact in modern cities, and the conservation of relevant artworks related to urban neo‐muralism has been increasingly recognized. Understanding these materials is critical to developing conservation strategies, as their composition continues to change with industrial innovation and regulatory changes. This study presents the application of an analytical approach that integrates chemical mapping based on spectroscopic approaches together with analytical pyrolysis, chromatography, and mass spectrometry to investigate two key case studies and provide insights into the evolution of street art materials over the past 30 years. This comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of the composition and transformation of urban art materials over time, overcoming the limitations of individual methods and revealing both organic and inorganic materials. This combined approach represents the state of the art in the study of synthetic paints used in modern art and provides new insights into the evolution of the formulation of materials used by street artists.",

    "abstract": "Lead‐based halide perovskites have excellent photoelectric properties and are considered as one of the most promising materials for X‐ray detection. At present, the degradation of lead‐based materials due to ion migration phenomenon and the long‐term instability of the prepared devices are still important problems that hinder their practical application. Herein, KI is incorporated into the BA2MA3Pb4I13 polycrystalline detector fabricated via the lamination method. The introduction of KI enhances both the crystallization quality and charge carrier transport capability of the perovskite polycrystalline film. By introducing K+ ions into the interstitial site of perovskite, the effective channel for ion migration is reduced, leading to increased ion activation energy, and then the ion migration in perovskite is effectively inhibited. Consequently, the prepared X‐ray detector exhibits improved stability, with a sensitivity of 6250 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 19.7 nGyair s−1. This study broadens the idea of enhancing the stability of perovskite and lays a research foundation for its practical application.",

The cords, along with cords from four other royal documents of the same period, show considerable deterioration due to age and material components. The analysis employed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS) and high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC‐UV‐Vis‐ESI MS/MS) to examine the inorganic mordants and organic dyes. The results revealed ellagitannin dyes in the black cords and lac and madder dye markers in one red cord. Some soluble redwoods (likely pernambuco, also known as brazilwood) were detected in the others, either on their own or mixed with weld. The preservation state varied among cords, correlating with the mordants; iron predominated in the black and red threads of Łaski’s Statute, contributing to their degradation, whereas the white cord exhibited higher sulfur content. In‐situ sampling using papers soaked with bathophenanthroline (Bphen) allowed detection of major elements in the fibers. These findings are vital for guiding future conservation practices and mitigating risks in cleaning and restoring these delicate materials.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive approach is taken to investigate the “Hungarian mine green” pigment, including a historical overview, analysis of the pigment on artworks, and its laboratory replication. It is known that in the past, the pigment is collected in wooden reservoirs in which copper (Cu) compounds precipitated from drainage water during copper mining at Špania Dolina–Piesky and Ľubietová deposits, Slovakia. Microsamples of four polychrome wooden sculptures from the 16th‐17th centuries are examined. Posnjakite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·H2O) and malachite (Cu2(CO3)(OH)2) are most frequently detected by X‐ray powder microdiffraction. In rock samples from the mine site, brochantite (Cu4SO4(OH)6) and malachite are dominant, and in recent precipitates, only langite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·2H2O) is detected, remained in contact with leaking water. In the laboratory, the pigment is prepared by gradually enriching the starting CuSO4·5H2O solution with NaHCO3 in two series of experiments. The initial concentration of the reactants reflected the ratio of Cu2+: HCO3− = 1:1 found in the mine waters at the site, from which langite crystallizes. However, langite does not formed, while brochantite gradually transformed into posnjakite and subsequently malachite. The co‐occurrence of basic copper sulfates and carbonates and the characteristic grain morphology proved to be the main indicators of the pigment in artworks.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the long‐term stability of nanofluids (NFs) is challenging due to the several  issues. This study is the first to focus on both the stability and thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of biomass‐derived carbon nanosphere (CNS)‐based NFs. It enhances NF stability by utilizing CNSs synthesized from eight biowaste sources, each exhibiting varying dispersion capabilities (zeta potential, ZP values) ranging from ‐17 mV to ‐45.6 mV. For the first time, this research investigates how the ZP of biomass‐derived CNSs influences the TC and dynamic viscosity (V) of biomass‐based NFs. The NFs demonstrated high stability without the need for surfactants, achieving up to 111.8% enhancement in TC with high stability up to 40 days.  The influence of CNS concentration (0.01‐ 0,1 wt%) on TC was studied, revealing optimal enhancement at 0.1 wt%. The effect of ZP on thermal diffusivity is also studied. This work bridges the gap between research and industry, offering significant potential in the automotive sector. It provides a practical guide for future researchers to enhance their understanding of high‐efficiency coolants. Furthermore, this study aligns with seven Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing a cost‐effective waste‐to‐wealth approach that promotes sustainability and innovation.",

Advancements in production techniques have markedly enhanced bioglycerol potential applications across various sectors, including as cosolvent in industrial formulations. In the context of eco‐sustainable formulation design, this study addresses the self‐aggregation of rhamnolipids, biosurfactants with a wide range of physico‐chemical and biological activities, in bioglycerol aqueous mixtures, studied by integrating surface tension and NMR self‐diffusion measurements. Preliminary analysis of the properties of water‐bioglycerol mixtures indicates that bioglycerol impurities (mainly potassium acetate) have only a small effect on surface tension and no discernible effect on bulk properties such as density, viscosity and refractive index. The aggregation of rhamnolipids is unaffected by bioglycerol at concentrations up to 40‐50 wt%. At higher cosolvent levels, the cmc increases and the micelle dimension micellar size decreases, an indirect effect of the decreasing polarity of the medium. These results provide the basic knowledge to promote the exploration of rhamnolipids and bioglycerol as valuable ingredients in formulations for various applications.",

    "abstract": "This study uses a membrane‐less reactor to explore the bioelectrochemical remediation of real contaminated groundwater from chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) and nitrates. The research focuses on testing a column‐type bioelectrochemical reactor to stimulate in‐situ degradation of contaminants through the supply of electrons by a graphite granules biocathode. After a preliminary laboratory characterization and operation with a synthetic feeding solution, a field test was conducted in a real contaminated site, where the reactor demonstrated effective degradation of CAHs and inorganic anions. Notably, the cathodic potential promoted the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated species. Simultaneously, nitrate reduction, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis occurred, influencing the overall coulombic efficiency of the process. The use of real groundwater, compared to the synthetic medium, significantly decreased the coulombic efficiency of reductive dechlorination, dropping from 2.43% to 0.01%. Concentration profiles along the bioelectrochemical reactor allowed for a deeper description of the reductive dechlorination rate at different flow rates as well as increased knowledge about reduction and oxidation mechanisms. Scaling up the technology presents several challenges, including the optimization of coulombic efficiency and the management of competing microbial metabolisms. The study provides a valuable contribution towards advancing bioelectrochemical technologies for bioremediation of complex contaminated sites.",

This study reports the design and synthesis of dopant‐free pyrazine‐based HTMs. PS1 features a D–A–D type structure with pyrazine as the acceptor and 4,4′‐dimethoxy triphenylamine (4,4′‐OMe‐TPA) as the donor, while PS2 adopts a D–π–A–π–D configuration with an additional thiophene unit as π‐spacer along with 4,4′‐OMe‐TPA as donor. Both compounds are synthesized through a simple two‐step synthetic procedure. These HTMs are subjected to structural, photophysical, electrochemical, theoretical, and photoelectrochemical studies with an emphasis on evaluation of structure–property relationships. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the electronic distribution, optimized molecular structure, and frontier molecular orbitals. Their performance in PVSCs is systematically evaluated without adding dopants. PS2 exhibits superior photoluminescence quenching compared to PS1, indicating more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite layer. Notably, PS2 achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%, surpassing the performance of PS1 (PCE of 10.15%). These findings highlight the potential of adjusting the electron‐deficient core and π‐bridge units as an effective strategy to optimize the properties of HTMs and improve their performance in PVSC applications.",

    "abstract": "The development of environmentally friendly oxidants has emerged as a prominent topic in the fields of green chemistry and chemical engineering. This review comprehensively examines the sustainable production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and its applications in green chemical synthesis. H2O2, known as a green oxidant, is generated through the 2e− ORR pathway using various catalysts, including noble metals, carbon‐based materials, single‐atom catalysts, and transition metal oxides. This method offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional H2O2 production, enabling in‐situ synthesis without organic waste. The review highlights the direct role of H2O2 in promoting chemical transformations, such as the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides and alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Additionally, it explores the indirect application of H2O2 through its decomposition into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in Fenton reactions, which drive selective oxidation and degradation processes. These applications demonstrate the versatility of H2O2 in advancing green chemistry by facilitating eco‐friendly oxidation reactions and pollutant degradation. Future work will focus on improving catalyst stability and scalability for industrial use, further enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of H2O2‐based chemical processes.",

Microsamples from these murals were analyzed using micro‐invasive techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy‐dispersive spectroscopy (SEM‐EDS), and Raman microspectroscopy. The study revealed a preparation layer of gypsum/anhydrite on adobe walls and a simple yet diverse palette of pigments. Red pigments included hematite (Fe₂O₃) and organic carmine dye, while green hues featured copper‐based pigments such as antlerite (Cu₃SO₄(OH)₃) and posnjakite (Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆·H₂O), identified here for the first time as a major component in Andean mural paintings. Blue tones were achieved using indigo and smalt, a cobalt‐containing glass pigment whose presence is still scarcely documented in Peruvian murals. These findings deepen our understanding of colonial pigment selection, preparation practices, and their deterioration mechanisms, contributing to sustainable conservation strategies. This study highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing knowledge of Hispanic‐American colonial art and its preservation as a vital component of cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the kinetics of platinum leaching using HClO4 and H2O2. The experiments were carried out by dissolving small pieces of high‐purity platinum with an irregular shape. The knowledge obtained can be useful for leaching minerals with disseminated native platinum in refractory minerals such as silicates of which there are large quantities in nature but are not processed due to their great refractoriness. The results show that increasing the temperature and the HClO4 concentration increases the leaching rate. Interestingly, for each HClO4 concentration, an H2O2/HClO4 = 2.5 ratio exists that optimises the leaching kinetics. The best operating conditions were approximately 70 °C, [HClO4] 3M, and [H2O2] 7.2 M. From kinetic analysis, it was concluded that the leaching process is governed by a mixed control stage (diffusion in the boundary layer and surface chemical reaction). Also, it was proposed that the leaching process mechanism is supported by fundamental thermodynamic and experimental results, highlighting the importance of chlorine gas for this novel extraction method that reaches elevated recoveries. This process is also interesting because the chemical system can potentially weaken the crystallographic structure of silicates (very important), increasing the feasibility of extracting the partially not liberated precious metals.",

    "abstract": "Gold (Au) exhibits distinct reactivities with O2 at the nanometer to atomic scales, whereas bulk Au is chemically inert. Since the discovery of catalytic reactivities in Au‐based materials, including nanoparticles, molecular complexes, and nanoclusters (AuNCs), mechanistic insights into the interaction and reductive activation of O2 by Au have been pursued by researchers. However, the atomic level understanding of the reaction mechanism remains elusive compared with that for other widely explored transition metalO2 systems. This paper briefly discusses recent progress in clarifying the reaction mechanisms of Au‐O2 chemistry for homogeneous molecular Au complexes and atomically precise AuNCs. We introduce our research on (1) O2‐activation by Au complexes without the distinct formation of conventional metal‐hydride species, and (2) the application of kinetic analyses to the reaction of thiolate‐protected AuNCs with O2 to quantify parameters like O2‐binding constants on the Au surface. These findings help elucidate both the Au‐O2 interaction and reductive activation of O2, which are essential in catalytic systems using O2 as a terminal oxidant that can contribute to the developments of eco‐friendly oxidation Au‐based catalysts with high performance.",

The phase formation and surface morphology of the NTO‐CN heterostructure illustrated the formation of monoclinic NaTaO3 crystallite and layered g‐C3N4. The light‐response properties of NTO‐CN heterostructure were significantly broadened in the visible spectrum. The elemental composition, binding energy, oxidation states of the constituent elements and surface adsorption of the synthesized materials were characterized. The percentage of degradation of RhB dye employing NTO‐CN heterostructure photocatalyst was computed to be 92.3%. This value was 1.66 times and 1.49 times greater than NaTaO3 and g‐C3N4 respectively. Pseudo first order rate constant value for NTO‐CN heterostructure photocatalyst was calculated to be 0.0288 min‐1. This value was 3.43 times and 2.82 times greater than NaTaO3 and g‐C3N4 respectively. Photocatalytic water splitting experiment was performed and amount of hydrogen evolved for 5 hrs was measured to be 1104 μmol/g for NTO‐CN, which was greater by a factor of 2.32 and 1.43 as that of NaTaO3 and g‐C3N4 respectively. In comparison to bare g‐C3N4 and NaTaO3, the NTO‐CN heterostructure photocatalyst demonstrated maximized photocatalytic performance.

Herein, first, the terpolymerization of CO2, propylene oxide (PO), and epichlorohydrin (ECH) to synthesize PPC‐ECH terpolymers via one‐pot and metal‐free method using multinuclear organoboron catalysts is reported. The PPC‐ECH terpolymers with well‐rounded properties can be easily synthesized by adjusting reaction conditions, monomer ratios, catalyst types, and loading. The molecular weight of the PPC‐ECH terpolymer can reach up to 59.4 kg mol−1, which is the highest known. Notably, the synthesized PPC‐ECH exhibits outstanding barrier performance with oxygen permeability as low as 1.31 cm3 mm (m2 day)−1 and water vapor permeability as low as 0.016 g mm (m2 day)−1, significantly lower than those of pure PPC or other common packaging materials. Importantly, the introduction of a small amount of ECH not only preserves the biodegradability of polycarbonate but also markedly enhances its mechanical properties, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and flame retardancy, offering promising prospects for application in packaging materials.",

Six root samples collected from traditional habitats are also analyzed to propose their quality markers. From 37 compounds common to all root samples, 8 compounds are proposed as potential quality markers based on their widespread presence and abundance across traditional growing regions.

The MNPs synthesized at each stage are analyzed using high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis (EDX), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (DT/TGA) to confirm the successful coating of the desired adsorbent. Fe3O4@SiO2@CPTES@DAT MNPs selectively recover Au(III) ions under optimum conditions of pH = 2, 10 mg adsorbent amount, and 20 min contact time, and quantification of Au(III) ions is carried out by inductively coupled plasma‐optical emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES). The method's suitability to adsorption isotherm and kinetic models is examined and found to be more compatible with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic model. Relative standard deviation, limit of detection, and limit of quantification are calculated as 2.51%, 0.019, and 0.065 μg L−1, respectively, as analytical performance parameters.

In this study, we identify the sterol metabolism‐related genes, which encode the aldolases (Ltp2 and Thl) and carboxylic acid reductases (CAR) in Mycolicibacterium neoaurum NRRL B‐3805 (B3805), by analysis of the metabolites from phytosterols biotransformation.

This recombinant strain (B3805V) is able to transform 5 g L−1 phytosterols to 2.0 g L−1 4‐HBC without detectable AD by‐product.

Different classes of metabolites, including phenolic acids, phenylethanoids, flavonoids, iridoids, organic acids, terpenes, and fatty acids, are identified in the three species, with methanol as the best solvent to recover bioactive compounds from the three species in addition to ethyl acetate for P. kurdica. Around 70% methanol extract of P. herba‐venti exerts the best radical scavenging and ions‐reducing properties, while its methanol extract exhibits the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. The ethyl acetate extract of P. fruticosa displays the best chelating power, and its other polar extracts have the highest total antioxidant activity. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations have underscored the therapeutic potential of bioactive compounds, including isoverbascoside, samioside, forsythoside B, and hattushoside. In conclusion, the study indicates that these three Phlomis species are a rich source of bioactive molecules with possible therapeutic applications, and the selection of appropriate extraction solvents is crucial for the targeted biological activity.",

This study aims to evaluate the interfacial and thermodynamic properties of five widely used petroleum surfactants to better understand their efficiency under mild reservoir‐like conditions. IFT is measured using the spinning drop tensiometer across a temperature range of 25–40 °C, while critical micelle concentrations (CMC) are determined via conductometric methods. Thermodynamic parameters of micellization are calculated from temperature‐dependent CMC data. The results show that micellization is an entropy‐driven process for all tested surfactants. The studied surfactants significantly reduce IFT values within the tested temperature range, underscoring their potential for practical application in EOR formulations. The study also confirms that accurate determination of CMC is essential in optimizing surfactant efficiency under varying environmental conditions.",

Utilizing the aggregation‐induced emission characteristic of TPEs, this study demonstrates that BPh‐TPE and BRh‐TPE function as “turn‐off” fluorescent sensors for detecting Cu2+ and Hg2+/Ag+, respectively, exhibiting quenched fluorescence in the presence of these ions. The limits of detection (LODs) for Cu2+, Hg2+, and Ag+ are determined to be 299, 522 nM, and 1.58 μM, respectively. Interestingly, the probes also show “turn‐on” fluorescence upon the addition of glutathione (GSH) in the presence of Cu2+ or Hg2+. Specifically, the LOD for GSH using the BPh‐TPE‐Cu2+ complex is 457 nM. Practical applicability is confirmed via visual color changes on filter paper and in water samples. These findings highlight the potential of these TPE derivatives for detecting copper, mercury, silver ions, and GSH in environmental water. Additionally, Al/organic layer/p‐Si heterojunction devices incorporating spin‐coated TPE layers are fabricated. Their electrical behaviors are analyzed through current‐voltage and current‐time measurements under varying light conditions. Transient photocurrent analysis indicates strong photoresponse, supporting their suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.",

    "abstract": "Biodegradable polymers are of great interest in addressing the current pollution problem caused by synthetic petroleum‐based polymers. It is well known that various microorganisms synthesize and store high‐molecular‐weight polyhydroxyalkanoates in their cytoplasm as water‐insoluble inclusions. In this study, the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii N‐15 strain is used for bioplastic production. The optimal polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) yield (62% of biomass, 23.6 g L−1 dry cells) is achieved by cultivating the bacteria in Burke's medium with molasses as a carbon source (5 wt.%) at 30 °C, 220 rpm, for 50 h. The resulting polymer was characterized using thin‐layer chromatography, UV‐Vis, fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and X‐ray diffraction. The results confirmed that the polymer is PHB with a purity of 98.9%, a molecular weight of 1.2 MDa, a crystallinity of 73%, a melting point of 179 °C, a decomposition temperature of 275 °C, a density of 1.22 g cm−3, a melt flow index of 10 g 10 min−1, a Shore hardness of 82, a tensile strength of 30 MPa, and a relative elongation at break of 4.5%. Thus, a bioplastic with properties suitable for practical applications is successfully obtained using molasses—a byproduct of sugar production.",

    "abstract": "Perchlorate ions (ClO4−) are prevalent contaminants in the surface, and drinking water that disrupt thyroid function by competitively inhibiting the sodium‐iodide symporter (NIS), posing significant health risks. Here, fluorescence‐based logic gates have been constructed by leveraging the binding interactions between a hemicyanine dye, 4‐[4‐(dimethylamino)‐styryl]‐1‐docosylpyridinium bromide (DASPC22) and β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) that could be useful to know whether ClO4− ions in water are within the toxicity range or not. In aqueous media, DASPC22 forms nonfluorescent H‐aggregates, but fluorescence is enhanced upon forming host‐guest inclusion complexes with β‐CD. At low ClO4− ions concentrations, fluorescence intensity further increases due to enhanced complex stability through hydrogen bonding. ONIOM‐based quantum chemical calculations have supported this phenomenon. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of DASPC22 in the presence of β‐CD and a low concentration of ClO4− ions leads to the construction of a YES logic gate that would enable one to quantify ClO4− ions’ toxicity range in water. Dual‐input‐single‐output AND and INHIBIT logic gates with low and high concentrations of ClO4− ions, respectively, have also been constructed.

In this work, Chlorine‐coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl‐FePc) has been studied as a catalyst for the electrochemical ORR. Coordination of iron phthalocyanine with chlorine introduces additional active sites for ORR, improving its catalytic activity.

The obtained catalyst exhibits fast kinetics for O2 adsorption and activation with an ultralow Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 and a remarkable half‐wave potential of 0.80 V.

The presence of neutral abpt, as well as azido ligands was proved by IR spectroscopy and the composition of the complexes confirmed an elemental analysis. Monocrystal X‐ray structure analysis revealed that 1 is an ionic pentacoordinated Cu(II) complex, exhibiting a distorted tetragonal pyramidal geometry of the coordination polyhedron, while 2 is a neutral molecular complex with a distorted octahedral environment of the Cu(II) atom. The structures are stabilized by π–π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of abpt, as well as various intra‐ and intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving nitrate ions and molecules of solvated water in 1 and 2, respectively. A field‐induced slow magnetic relaxation was observed at low temperatures in 1, described by the direct and Raman process involving low‐energy intramolecular vibrational modes, which were predicted by the DFT calculations.",

In this article, we report the synthesis of a series of azomethine‐pyrazole derivatives bearing a para‐substituted azo‐phenyl ring. These compounds were evaluated as antifungal agents against Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans strains. Compound ClAzoNH, substituted by chloride, displayed the highest toxicity on Candida albicans, with an MIC50 value of 2.08 μg/mL, while methoxy‐substituted MeOAzoNH showed moderate inhibitory activity. The unsubstituted AzoNH compound exhibited the highest activity towards Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei strains. In the case of C. albicans, the CaCYP51 protein appears to be the most probable biological target, while for C. neoformans, interactions with the CnFTase protein explained the in vitro results.",

Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PBSA were employed to elucidate the binding modes of compounds 1, 3, 6, and 9 with PARP‐1, providing valuable insights into their interaction mechanisms and supporting future drug development efforts.

This review aims to investigate the prospect of using biochar specifically from alien vegetation as a support material for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell electrocatalyst, highlighting the need to move to green energy and invest in Eco conservation. The use of biochar derived from alien vegetation as carbon support for the platinum (Pt) electrocatalyst for PEM fuel cells is an interesting field that is slowly gaining momentum. Biochar has the potential to be used as a carbon support due to its high specific surface, area, and intrinsic property needed for an electrocatalyst support. The current widely used electrocatalyst, which is Pt supported on carbon black, has shown to suffer from corrosion which weakens the bond between the support and the Pt nanoparticles, leading to instability and resistance; therefore, alternative supports are needed also to decrease the Pt loading as it is expensive. The focus of this review is on the benefits and prospects of these cheap green resources in increasing efforts to conserve the environment.",

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) are obtained on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in acetonitrile (MeCN) and 0.1 mol L−1 n‐Bu4NPF6 versus Ag|AgCl|Cl−, to evaluate cathodic and anodic behavior and chemical processes. The CVs of LQB‐109 display two irreversible cathodic waves at −2.04 V and − 2.19V, related to a four‐electron reduction to hydroxylamine. Two anodic waves appeared at +1.32 V and +1.53 V. The first electron uptake for LQB‐569 occurs in the nitroaromatic group, followed by reductions to give a more electrophilic nitroso, prone to dimerizing and forming reducible azoxy derivatives, along with nitrone reduction, in a 10‐electron total process. One irreversible anodic wave at +1.45 V appears, related to the nitrone oxidation. The electrochemical oxidation profile can be correlated to antioxidant capacity (AO). The ability to scavenge 2,2‐diphenil‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)• radicals (% radical scavenging activity) and reduce ferric complexes (ferric‐reducing antioxidant power) were used to assess. LQB‐569 showed low AO, due to the presence of the electron‐withdrawing group, reflecting the oxidative part of the CVs.",

The ligand synthesis is straight forward and accomplished in two steps. Detailed studies show that the implementation of the functional groups in the [FeFe]‐hydrogenase mimic has marginal impact on the structural, thermodynamic properties, and catalytic performance in the electrochemical proton reduction reaction. However, the modification opens the way for a wide variety of functionalization in the ligand backbone, e.g., for applications in photo/electrocatalysis. Electrochemical investigations reveal that initial two electron reductions are followed by protonation by acetic acid forming an asymmetric diironhydride species. Further reduction of the hydride species and protonation leads to H2 formation. Utilizing foot of the wave analysis, a reaction rate of 2 × 108 s−1 m−1 for the H2 evolution step consisting of the reaction of the metal hydride species and the external acid has been determined. However, catalysis is limited by the formation of the hydride at a rate constant of about 4 × 104 s−1 m−1.",

Despite the advancement of flexible Lithium‐ion (Li+) batteries, achieving full adaptability requires redesigning individual battery components. Conventional graphite electrodes are used in Li+ batteries but remain rigid and brittle, limiting applications in flexible energy storage. Here, this limitation is addressed by integrating nanocellulose (NCF), a nanoscale biopolymer, with graphite (G), to yield an intrinsically flexible electrode platform. Five NCF/G battery electrode compositions with increasing NCF content (40–70 wt%) are fabricated via a straightforward aqueous route and are evaluated in Li+ half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li+ and NCF surface groups suggesting Li+ diffusion through nanochannels. A perspective on the material‐driven reshaping of flexible NCF/G battery electrodes is provided, by investigating the contribution of NCF to charge storage mechanisms and to mechanical resilience. This study contributes to the development of battery electrodes that can be tailored to energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics applications, and towards battery market diversification.",

    "abstract": "The electroreduction of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers promising opportunities for the synthesis of valuable chemical precursors. However, achieving high selectivity in this process remains challenging due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved. Here, this study employs different electrochemical techniques to analyze each of the HMF electroreduction pathways. These findings demonstrate that the primary products of HMF electroreduction are 2,5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 5‐methylfurfural alcohol (MFA), with lower formation of 5‐methylfurfural (5‐MF) and 2,5‐dimethylfuran. This study identifies a significant competition between hydrogen evolution reaction and the reduction of HMF and 5‐MF that affect the faradaic efficiencies of the organic transformation. In contrast, BHMF and MFA display a reduced reactivity, behaving as terminal molecules. Through impedance analysis, it is possible to follow the reaction pathways by associating each reaction step with the changes observed in charge transfer and accumulation phenomena. These are key parameters for understanding the reaction mechanisms in the system as they allow to distinguish between adsorption, absorption and reaction of the organic molecules onto the electrode surface. This approach helps to accurately select the optimal potential for the reduction reactions. The results obtained in this study facilitate the design of efficient and selective electrocatalytic systems for biomass conversion.",

Consequently, the resulting high catalyst loadings induce several interesting and opposing phenomena, namely, lower ORR kinetic losses due to an increase in the number of active sites and much higher mass and charge transport losses. In this work, Fourier‐transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are employed to systematically deconvolute the gains and losses to the activity due to the high loading of PGM‐free catalysts and relate the underlying processes to the observed fuel cell performance. EIS is analyzed via extraction of the distribution of relaxation times, obtaining a model‐free analysis of the physical processes in the cell. Combined with FTacV measurements, the obtained catalyst loading optimum from a mechanistic point of view is explained. The combined use of advanced alternating current techniques for the analysis of operating fuel cells is an important step toward the rational design of the catalyst layer.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic azobenzenes generally exhibit enhanced photophysical properties compared to conventional linear azobenzenes, such as visible‐light activation and exceptional thermal stability. However, their broader application has been hindered by synthetic challenges. Herein, the electrochemical synthesis of a ten‐membered cyclic azobenzene, 6,7‐dihydrodibenzo[e,i][1,4,7,8]dioxadiazecine (DDEI), is reported through the reduction of 1,2‐bis(2‐nitrophenoxy)ethane (BNPOE) in the presence of CO2. The reduction mechanism, involving an irreversible eight‐electron process and CO2 capture, is elucidated using in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) spectroelectrochemistry, complemented by 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry analyzes. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that DDEI undergoes highly efficient trans‐to‐cis isomerization under green light (500 nm) irradiation, achieving a remarkable yield of 97%, with both isomers exhibiting excellent thermal stability. In contrast to 8‐ and 9‐membered cyclic azobenzenes and in line with conventional linear azobenzenes, the trans configuration of DDEI is more stable than the cis configuration. This combination of synthetic accessibility and superior photophysical properties makes DDEI a promising candidate for various applications, including those in living systems.",

    "abstract": "Catalyst dissolution is one of the key challenges in achieving long‐term performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with low iridium loading. However, most of the dissolved catalyst remains in the catalyst‐coated membrane, inaccessible for operando quantification. While simpler aqueous model systems improve mechanistic understanding, dissolution rates are significantly overestimated compared to the device level. To bridge this gap, herein, an electrochemical half‐cell setup that mimics the anode catalyst layer environment to enable operation at relevant current densities (>1 ) is presented. Dissolved catalyst species transported through the porous transport layer or through the membrane are separately detected operando by coupling to inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate a strong preference for the transport of dissolved iridium through the membrane (99.9%) and a decrease in catalyst stability by factor 10 at high current densities. Discrepancies with so far reported findings from full‐cell and half‐cell experiments highlight a lack of understanding of catalyst dissolution and the transportation of dissolved species in different systems. The presented method offers unique insights which will help to study and optimize catalyst dissolution by means of various manufacturing and operation parameters to ultimately improve the stability of catalyst layers for water electrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports show [FeFe] hydrogenase mimics are active for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate (HCOO−). Herein, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with the [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic [Fe2(μ‐pdt)(CO)6, 1, where pdt = propane‐1,3‐dithiolate] in acetonitrile is reported. In the presence of the weak acid, methanol (MeOH), 1 reduces CO2 to both CO (Faradaic Efficiency maximum [FEmax] of 16 ± 6%) and HCOO− (FEmax = 20%) and produces H2 (FEmax = 56 ± 4%). Without added MeOH, 1 reacts with adventitious water to form H2 (FEmax = 85 ± 1%), HCOO− (FEmax = 7.8%), and CO (FEmax = 7 ± 3%) with CO32− being detected by infrared spectroscopy.  Product formation is potential dependent: more negative potentials increases selectivity for HCOO− over CO. The first reduction of 1 forms a pdt‐bridged dimer, 2. However, the reduction of 2 at the potentials required for electrochemical CO2 reduction leads to two new species. Using density functional theory, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR‐SEC), these structures are identified to be [Fe(CO)4]2− (3) and a trinuclear Fe3 species (4). While these species can reduce CO2 to CO and HCOO−, the predominant formation of H2 reveals kinetic issues in  CO2 reduction. The work offers to consider alternate competing mechanistic pathways and explains the lack of product selectivity when using hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO−.",

Enhancing OER efficiency is essential for reducing energy barriers and improving system performance. In this study, it develops a composite catalyst of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ and IrO2 (PBSCF‐Ir), with a surface area of 18.68 m2g−1. The PBSCF‐Ir composite exhibits a low overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and stability over 300 h. In water splitting tests, it achieves a lower cell voltage (1.95 V at 500 mA cm−2) compared to pure IrO2. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a 1 eV blueshift in Co 2p energy levels, indicating modified electronic structures. Density functional theory calculations show that IrO2 shifts the d‐band centers of Co and Fe, enhancing electrophilicity, OH− affinity, and OER activity. This study highlights the PBSCF‐Ir composite as an efficient and durable catalyst for AWS, thereby addressing the need for sustainable hydrogen production.",

Recent studies on tuning the microenvironment near the catalyst surfaces by tuning the local electric field in nonaqueous environments have been shown to promote eCO2R by facilitating the CO2 activation step. Herein, the use of tetraethylammonium (TEA) cation to tune the electric field on Fe surfaces, such that it leads to the formation of industrially relevant oxalates (C2 products), is reported. At optimal cation concentrations, the developed eCO2R system achieves 25 mA cm−2 of current density and Faradaic Efficiencies up to 75% toward oxalate. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of surface‐adsorbed TEA cations and other species on the Fe surfaces, leading to the well‐known outer‐sphere mechanism of electron transfer during eCO2R. The employment of Fe, along with microenvironment tuning, not only demonstrates high catalytic performance but also provides a safer and more sustainable alternative to toxic catalysts such as Pb that dominate the nonaqueous eCO2R literature. These findings pave the way for further optimization and scale‐up of the process, offering a viable route for sustainable chemical production and CO2 mitigation.",

    "abstract": "With global energy demand increasing alongside population growth, the importance of efficient, clean energy conversion systems like fuel cells and batteries intensifies. Fuel cells are recognized for their ability to generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen, with water as the only byproduct, and can also function in reverse as energy storage systems by producing hydrogen. Batteries chemically store energy and enable zero‐carbon emissions through their closed‐loop functionality. As demand grows, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is more actively used for investigating various electrochemical and physicochemical properties within electrochemical systems. Furthermore, EIS can serve as an in situ analysis method during operation, making it even more impactful in the near future. This article reviews the studies and applications of EIS, an advanced technique that provides insights into the electrochemical reaction at the interfaces and charge transfer processes within these systems. In addition, it provides an overview of the electrochemical principles governing these technologies, with a focus on the distinct roles and mechanisms of their components. The review offers a deeper understanding of EIS applications for studying electrochemical performance and physicochemical properties while also covering advancements in state‐of‐the‐art technologies for fuel cells, electrolyzers, and batteries.",

First, the electrochemical deposition potentials are altered in equivalent electrolyte conditions, which is found to alter the size of the deposited nanomaterials and the corresponding electrode surface roughness. Second, the electrodes are soaked in thiol‐containing solutions containing a range of both aromatic and aliphatic thiols to achieve chemically modified self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the electrode surfaces. The surface and morphological properties of the electrodeposited electrodes are assessed with scanning electron microscopy, laser confocal, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Confocal and AFM also allow the determination of the surface roughness of the electrodes at both the microscale and the nanoscale. The presence of SAM‐modification is determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angles are also measured on the nonthiol‐modified and thiol‐modified electrodes, and the contact angle is found to increase from 70°–100° to 130°–140°, close to superhydrophobic levels of contact angles.",

Herein, a propylene carbonate (PC)‐based electrolyte system is reported, employing hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as synergistic additives. Specifically, HFB facilitates compatibility with graphite anodes through selective interfacial adsorption, while the decomposition of FEC stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), mitigating the formation of high‐impedance interfaces. This tailored electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity, excellent oxidative stability, and broad temperature tolerance. When validated at 4.5 V, high‐loading NCM811/graphite cells achieve nearly full capacity over 100 cycles at low temperatures (−20 °C), with pouch cells retaining 80% of their capacity after 470 cycles.

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with their unique structural tunability, redox properties, and high surface area have emerged as promising candidates for the OER process. In this work, a presentation on how linker functionalization in rather unexplored manganese‐based MOFs leads to enhanced OER activity is given. A series of manganese‐based MOFs in rarely reported MIL‐88B structure (Mn‐MIL‐88‐X) is synthesized using functionalized linkers [X = NH2, NO2, Br]. The objective is to modulate the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of the MOFs leading to enhanced OER activity. Among functionalized MOFs, Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 shows remarkable performance, requiring only 260 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1. The improvement in OER activity of Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 is ascribed to the higher oxidation states of manganese (Mn3+/Mn4+) and the presence of the amino group (‐NH2) as confirmed through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work paves the way for the designing and exploring of mixed‐valence state metal‐based MOFs as advanced electrode materials for electrocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "The activation of CO2 is essential for efficient electrochemical conversion, yet its weak physisorption on pristine Cu surfaces severely hinders catalytic performance. To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the OCO angles and elongate the CO bonds, transforming CO2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual‐V and dual‐Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO2, leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu‐based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO2 utilization.",

Most donor–acceptor‐type luminescent systems show solvent‐polarity sensitivity, which limits their applications. Herein, three alternate π‐conjugated biphenyl/terphenyl substituents are attached to the TTM unit. Results reveal that connection modes and types of benzene ring derivatives lead to distinct charge transfer (CT) and locally excited state hybrid emitters due to the differences in conjugation degree. All three radicals exhibit polarity‐insensitive red emission (626–690 nm), and their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) increase with solvent polarity. Specifically, linear‐conjugated TTM‐DPh has higher photostability but lower PLQY, while nonlinear‐conjugated TTM‐3DPh and TTM‐TPh have nearly 10‐fold higher PLQYs. The photophysical studies suggest that the conjugation degree and hybridization level between CT and ground states account for these properties.",

Herein, the successful synthesis of ≈2.6 nm AuPt alloy nanoparticles supported on MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures via in situ transformation of α‐MnO2 is reported. Selective aerobic photocatalytic glycerol oxidation toward value‐added C3 products has been achieved with AM 1.5G light irradiation under ambient conditions on these as synthesized 1 wt% AuPt/MnO2‐Mn3O4, which displays 2.3 and 6.5 times enhancement compared to that of AuPt/Mn3O4 and AuPt/MnO2. A 74% overall C3 product selectivity (60% in terms of glyceric acid) has been achieved at 75% glycerol conversion after 4 h of photocatalytic reaction. Investigation results reveal that the formation of MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures combines the local photothermal heating (primarily on MnO2) synergistically with the photochemical catalysis (on Mn3O4), thus achieving enhanced photocatalytic glycerol oxidation. This study may provide guidance for future catalyst design, where photon‐driven photocatalysis with phonon‐driven photothermal effect can be seamlessly integrated to achieve maximal solar energy utilization and high photocatalytic efficiency.",

Among photochemical techniques, photopolymerization stands out as a rapid, controlled, and eco‐friendly approach, making it particularly suitable for applications like 3D printing. This research in two‐photon‐induced photopolymerization for 3D microfabrication led to groundbreaking performance, thanks to the use of custom π‐extended molecular architectures as photoinitiators. Building on these results, a photoactivable initiation system for photoinduced‐atom transfer radical polymerization (photoATRP) is now reported using a similar π‐extended photoinitiator. Through comprehensive optimization, we successfully created a functional multicomponent photoinitiating system, with its detailed mechanism thoroughly established in solution. By covalently attaching alkyl halides to glass surfaces, we were able to implement the surface‐induced photo‐ATRP technique to create customized brush polymer architectures. This work not only advances the understanding of photoATRP mechanisms but also introduces new strategies for functional surface engineering, with potential applications in two‐photon‐induced surface modification of 3D/4D structures via photoATRP.",

Switches based on 2‐pyridyl‐ or 2‐pyridylmethyl‐containing N‐components exhibit strong fluorescence in their protonated Z‐configurations, compared to their phenyl/benzyl counterparts.

They have been extensively investigated in material sciences for numerous applications. The synthesis of cyanine dyes with various functional groups on the methine chain has attracted significant attention because it significantly alters the properties of the dye. However, few synthetic methods have been reported for directly introducing groups onto the methine chains of cyanine dyes. Ketone functional groups are essential in synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials chemistry. However, there are no reports on the direct introduction of ketone groups into cyanine dyes. Trifluoroacetylation is performed on the methine chains of polymethine cyanine dyes. This is achieved by directly using anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid to synthesize trifluoroacetylated trimethine, pentamethine, and heptamethine cyanine dyes in good yields. Single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis is performed to determine the substitution positions in the synthesized dyes. The results reveal that trifluoroacetylation of the methine chain shortens the maximum absorption wavelength and decreases the molar absorption coefficient in dichloromethane solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) film compared to an unsubstituted cyanine dye, and decreases the fluorescence quantum yield. This study highlights the unique properties of trifluoroacetylated polymethine cyanine dyes.",

Herein, bismuth manganate (BMO) is investigated as a photoanode absorber material for PEC. BMO thin films are prepared by a sol–gel method with and without a bismuth oxide (BO) overlayer. It is found that the BO overlayer forms BO nanoislands after annealing. Under visible light illumination, BMO with BO nanoislands results in a nearly tenfold increase of the current density compared to pristine BMO at the same applied potential. This increased performance is related to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and in the amount of recombinations based on the formation of a favorable heterojunction between BMO and BO. The application of overlayers on electrode materials in combination with suitable band alignment is an effective strategy to improve the performance of PEC electrodes.",

This system, along with a couple more reference compounds, namely ZnP‐3DoH‐COOH and C60trZnPCOOH, is tested as photosensitizers in p‐type dye‐sensitized solar cells (p‐DSSCs). Photophysical studies, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, reveal strong electronic communication between the porphyrin core and the fullerene unit, corroborated by theoretical calculations demonstrating efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Electrochemical measurements, supported by theoretical insights, confirm that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) energy levels of the C60‐3PV‐ZnP‐2DoH‐COOH dyad are well aligned for effective integration into NiO‐based DSSCs. Notably, photovoltaic performance measurements show that solar cells sensitized with the covalent dyad exhibit significantly enhanced efficiencies compared with those using the reference compounds and other “ZnP‐Acceptor” dyads. These findings highlight the potential of covalent ZnPor‐C60 assemblies in advancing the design of high‐performance p‐type DSSCs.",

Structural and electronic modifications of the parent luminol can effectively enhance the (photo)physical and (photo)chemical properties. Herein, a straightforward route to stereoelectronically modulated luminol derivatives is developed by utilization of an effective cross‐coupling at a versatile bromo phthalimide precursor. The modular synthesis enabled convenient access to two distinct classes of photoactive molecules: highly fluorescent 6–aryl–4–amino N‐methyl phthalimides and chemiluminescent 7–aryl luminol derivatives. Electron‐rich aryl substituents are shown to significantly enhance chemiluminescence (CL) quantum yields and exhibit good limits of detection in a CL hydrogen peroxide assay. The stereoelectronic effects on absorption, fluorescence, and CL properties are evaluated by experimental and theoretical studies.",

    "abstract": "Organic–inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) exhibiting superior optoelectronic properties have shown broad applications in sensing, photovoltaic devices, information storage, and biological imaging. Compared with pure inorganic or pure organic materials, OIMHs are distinguished by their hybrid feature, with processability of organic components and robustness of inorganic units, as well as plentiful luminescent sources derived from organic ligands, self‐trapped excitons (STEs) of inorganic lattices, or the energy transfer between organic and inorganic species. Thereinto, chemical composition tunability of organic component, metal ions, and halogen provides multiple adjustable sites to tailor their structures and physicochemical properties. However, how to realizing effective and tunable luminescence in OIMHs for desired applications through rational chemical composition regulation has become a challenge. In this review, starting from the structurally tunable sites of OIMHs, the feasible methods for regulating the luminescent properties of OIMHs are summarized, which include the change of organic components, tunable dimensionality and configurations of inorganic species, heterometal inorganic units, as well as the systematic multisite fine‐tuning based on a specific matrix. Finally, the challenges to synthesize OIMHs with promising luminescence performance through chemical composition regulation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the photophysical, electroluminescence, and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties of two solution‐processable fluorescent diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives is reported. Photophysical measurements are carried out in solution and blend films containing a 4,4′‐bis(N‐carbazolyl)‐1,10‐biphenyl (CBP) or a poly[(9,9‐di‐n‐octylfluorenyl‐2,7‐diyl)‐alt‐(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol‐4,8‐diyl)] host, to gain important insights into the excited state behavior of these dyes. Quantum chemical calculations are also carried out to support the experimental findings. An optimization of the doping concentration in the CBP blends is necessary to reduce the strong aggregation. This optimization led for both near‐infrared‐emitting dyes to a substantial increase of the photoluminescence quantum yield, which can reach values as high as 60%. It is also found that the blend films show excellent ASE properties with a threshold as low as 3.5–4.5 μJ cm−2 for peak wavelengths of 739 and 727 nm. In addition, the electroluminescence properties of the two organic laser dyes are examined in organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best OLED device shows a maximum external quantum efficiency value of around 2%. Overall, this study demonstrates the excellent potential of diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives for high‐performance near‐infrared organic semiconductor lasers and provides useful information for the design of new efficient near‐infrared emitters for optoelectronic applications.",

Designing chiral materials with enhanced properties requires a deep understanding of underlying physical principles, often revealed only through large datasets. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful tool for accelerating discovery and optimization, efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces. This work explores the synergy between AI and chiroptical properties, highlighting recent advances in data‐driven approaches for circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence. AI has demonstrated its ability to predict these phenomena accurately while uncovering structure–property relationships that can remain hidden under traditional methods. Various strategies are examined for integrating AI into chiroptical properties and the challenges and future directions of this field are discussed. In conclusion, combining chemical intuition with AI offers great potential for the rational design of next‐generation chiral materials. This integration not only promises to unlock novel compounds with enhanced chiroptical properties but also provides new opportunities to deepen our understanding of chiroptical phenomena.",

In this concept, the key structural requirements for dinuclear CrIII complexes with ferromagnetic exchange interactions and with photoluminescence properties, respectively, are analyzed. Rational merger of these key magneto‐optical–structural correlations leads to new types of dinuclear CrIII complexes with ferromagnetic coupling and room temperature luminescence, and their photophysical properties make them promising photosensitizers for energy transfer.

Simultaneously, it achieves dual‐mode fluorescence modulation through both photoexcitation and acid/base stimuli. However, the heterotetraarylene and quinoline connected by carbon carbon single bonds exhibit divergent properties, including light‐induced emission enhancement and solvent‐dependent fluorescence emission. This bond‐selective functional divergence enables precise customization of stimulus‐responsive fluorescence through simple connectivity control, establishing a novel design paradigm for smart molecular systems. Furthermore, the heterotetraarylene‐linked quinolines with carbon carbon double bonds exhibit many properties, thus allowing for the construction of a new dual‐responsive encryption system.",

    "abstract": "Development of near‐infrared (NIR)‐light‐driven photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is indispensable for an efficient use of solar energy in a sustainable society. Herein, a strategy is reported for achieving higher quantum yields of NIR‐light‐driven photocatalytic H2 production using salts of diprotonated dodecaphenylporphyrin (H4DPP2+(X−)2), showing large saddle distortion as organic photosensitizers and platinum nanoparticles as catalysts. When a perchlorate ion (ClO4−) is employed as a counter ion (X−) of H4DPP2+(X−)2, the quantum yield of the photocatalytic H2 production reaches to 36% by excitation at 750 nm, which is the highest value among those of NIR‐light‐driven H2 production reported so far. Such a drastic enhancement of the quantum yield is achieved by selection of X− as an appropriate counter anion of H4DPP2+, judging from second‐order rate constants of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from electron donors to 3(H4DPP2+(X−)2)* and the reorganization energy of ET for H4DPP2+(X−)2.",

When 2,5‐diformylfuran (DFF) and methyl levulinate (MLA) were employed as substrates, the yield of long‐chain dicarboxylic acid ester precursors reached 91.0% in the presence of pyrrolidine lactate. This preparation process eliminated the need for additional acids and bases, thereby minimizing the generation of waste salts, which was a common issue in base‐catalyzed systems and biosynthesis methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization revealed that a strong interaction between the hydroxyl group of the catalyst and the carbonyl group of MLA facilitated the activation of the substrate for the aldol condensation reaction. Notably, the yield of dicarboxylic acid ester precursors remained stable even after five catalytic cycles, demonstrating the excellent reusability of the catalyst. Furthermore, pyrrolidine lactate exhibited broad applicability in both aldol condensation and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. This work presented a novel and sustainable strategy for the synthesis of long‐chain dicarboxylic acid ester precursors.",

Herein, the impact on the Brønsted acidity (probed by pyridine adsorption and thermodesorption) and on the catalytic properties (in meta‐xylene isomerization) of ZSM‐5 zeolites shaped with silica binders is quantified. The effect of sodium was assessed by using two binders exhibiting different sodium contents. Operando infrared monitoring of the reaction shows that only a portion of the zeolite crystallites is active at short time on stream, which suggests that the inner part of the crystallites does not take part in the catalytic test reaction. The evolution of acidity and activity upon shaping by extrusion is compatible with a model where sodium from the binder heterogeneously poisons the zeolites dominantly at the outer shell of the crystallites. The quantitative impact of shaping zeolites thus depends strongly on the silica source, the crystallite size and shape, the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, and on the catalytic reaction of interest.",

The use of these supports was found to enhance the reducibility and dispersion of the iridium phase, while the presence of acid sites of varying strengths contributed to higher catalytic activity in the toluene hydrogenation reaction. The innovation of the applied synthesis method lies in the use of ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) as the aluminum source and hydrogen fluoride as the fluorine source. Proper selection of the AACH and HF ratios enables the synthesis of binary materials with controlled Al₂O₃ and AlF₃ content, as well as tailored textural, structural, and acidic properties. The effect of calcination temperature on crystallinity, the type of crystal phases formed, and the resulting porous structure of the binary supports was investigated. It was found that the AlF₃–Al₂O₃ support, after calcination at 500 °C, exhibits a mesoporous structure with a surface area of 102 m2/g and the presence of the AlF1.96(OH)1.04 phase, which proved to be the most effective support for the iridium active phase.

The gCN/NiO‐3.12%/Pt(IV) heterojunctions, with 1.31 wt% Pt, exhibited the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 132.9 mol H₂ mol Pt−¹ min−¹ in hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis, which is 1.9 times higher than that of gCN/Pt(IV) nanocomposites. The enhanced activity of the gCN/NiO/Pt nanocatalysts can be attributed to the heterojunction formed between gCN and NiO, which facilitates greater visible‐light absorption, more efficient photo‐induced charge separation, and improved charge carrier transfer compared to the gCN/Pt nanocatalysts in photo‐assisted HAB. Reusability tests demonstrated that the gCN/NiO/Pt heterojunction photocatalysts retained 84% of their initial hydrogen generation rate (mL H₂/min) after five consecutive runs of HAB.

In this context, reforming of the mixed alkanes (RMA) in the purge gas and recycling of the produced syngas can effectively enhance the carbon and hydrogen efficiency of C1 chemistry. However, in‐depth structure‐performance relationships and catalytic mechanisms were rarely investigated for RMA, which forms a major research gap for further development. Herein, a series of Ni–MgO–CeO2 catalysts with different Mg and Ce contents were prepared, and the catalytic performance in reforming of mixed alkanes was investigated. It was found that smaller Ni particles on the Mg‐rich samples (NM6C0 and NM5C1) are more effective for the activation of C2H6. However, the generated CxHy intermediates cannot be converted with matching kinetics, which resulted in the formation of unwanted CH4 and more importantly, larger amounts of carbon deposition. On the other hand, despite a moderate C2H6 conversion is observed on Ce‐rich samples, appropriate balance between the generation of CxHy intermediates from alkanes and their conversion aided by the activated CO2 and H2O can be established, resulting in excellent anticarbon properties. Overall, the optimum catalyst (NM3C3) showed stable CH4 and C2H6 conversion (28% and 43%, respectively) and negligible carbon formation in 100‐h operation. Upon the comparison with individual reforming of CH4 and C2H6, this study also presented in‐depth understanding on the different mechanism and reaction network for reforming of mixed alkanes, which solidifies the foundation of catalyst design in related areas including CO2 utilization or C1 reforming.",

TMDCs possess excellent physicochemical characteristics with tuneable bandgaps, large surface area, and intense visible‐light absorption that render them exceptionally competent for initiating photo‐induced redox reactions. The review highlights mechanistic understanding concerning charge carrier generation and separation, defect engineering, and interfacial electron transfer, all of which is a key to improved photocatalytic performance. Particular focus is on pollutant degradation mechanisms, water splitting kinetics, and CO₂ photoreduction mechanisms. Though promising, TMDCs face challenges such as photo‐corrosion, short‐term stability issues, and scale‐up limitations. To overcome these challenges, the formation of heterojunctions with visible‐light‐active semiconductors, such as halide perovskites, is emphasized as a potential method to enhance charge separation and broaden spectral response. Furthermore, the integration of TMDCs with cocatalysts and the design of multicomponent heterostructures are investigated as methods to promote durability and efficiency.

By modulating nitrogen content (1.65–13.25 at.%) and speciation (pyridinic/pyrrolic versus graphitic N) in NC supports, we demonstrated that nitrogen functionalities critically influence MoO2 reduction and Mo2C stabilization. Higher N content in NC2 and NC3 enhanced metal‐support interactions, promoting Mo2C formation during H2 reduction, while NC1 (low N) favored metallic Mo. However, under DRM conditions, all catalysts deactivated due to Mo2C oxidation to MoO2, with stability marginally improved at 850 °C via improved “oxidation‐re‐carbonization” cycles. Introducing Ni (5–15 wt.%) via impregnation facilitated CH4 dissociation and lowered MoO2 reduction temperatures through hydrogen spillover, boosting initial CH4/CO2 conversions and H2/CO ratios. Yet, Ni incorporation accelerated carbon support degradation (>50% mass loss) and induced inactive phases (NiO, Ni3Mo3N), offsetting its promotional effects. Combined XRD, H2‐TPR, Raman, and XPS analyses revealed the interplay between N defects, Mo speciation, and Ni–Mo interactions, underscoring the challenges in balancing activity and stability.

This study investigates how the physicochemical properties of Pd nanoparticles and support characteristics influence the continuous process performance including FA conversion, evolved gas flow rate, total hydrogen production, and catalyst durability. Pd catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation using various precursors, powdered supports, and Pd loadings and evaluated in a fixed‐bed reactor. The findings reveal that Pd/AC catalysts prepared with PdCl₂ precursor and nanopowdered AC are the most efficient. Strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged PdCl₄2⁻ species and the positively charged AC surface during impregnation enhance nanoparticle support interactions, resulting in small (∼2 nm), highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles with a high Pd2⁺/Pd⁰ atomic surface ratio. Metal dispersion is the dominant factor influencing hydrogen production, surpassing the effects of both particle size and electronic state. Higher Pd loadings also increased catalyst durability, reducing regeneration frequency. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Pd/AC catalysts, paving the way for efficient FA utilization as a hydrogen carrier.",

For some time now, it has been known that shear is unlikely to harm most proteins directly. Rather, interfacial phenomena, particularly those involving dynamic gas‐liquid interfaces are critical contributors to protein damage, which leads to aggregation and compromises stability. This work investigated the kinetic stability of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase (HMFO; EC: 1.1.3.47) in a 2 L stirred tank reactor. Exposure experiments revealed that the leading cause of enzyme deactivation was exposure to the gas‐liquid interface, either produced deliberately when sparging gas into the system or by accidental air entrainment from the overhead space due to mechanical stirring. This was further proven by experiments using the Bio Thrust membrane module, which enabled bubble‐free aeration thus, confirming that exposure to the gas‐liquid interface is the leading cause of deactivation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA novel strategy to synthesize micro‐structured cobaltite (ACo2O4; A = Fe, Mn, Cu) catalysts with tunable catalytic properties exhibiting highly selective production of glycerol carbonate via urea glycerolysis reaction is demonstrated. FeCo2O4 microcubes, MnCo2O4 microspheres, and CuCo2O4 micro‐octahedrons were produced via an ultrasonication‐assisted hydrothermal approach. The impact of urea (U), semicarbazide (S) as structure directing agents (SDAs), and metal ion substitution (A = Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+) on catalyst morphology and acid–base active sites in cobaltite is confirmed using various material characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The enhanced catalytic properties resulted in a significant improvement in their catalytic performance, particularly in terms of activity and selectivity. The order of yield (Y) and selectivity (S) for GC production is FeCo2O4‐U microcubes (Y95 ± 3%, S99%) > MnCo2O4‐S microspheres (Y91.5 ± 3%, S98.5%) > CuCo2O4‐S micro‐octahedrons (Y83.4 ± 3%, S92.4%) > Co3O4 (Y35 ± 3%, 99%), as determined using the GC‐MS analysis. This performance is attributed to the effective catalytic activation of urea, leading to enhanced GC production via the isocyanic acid pathway. Therefore, the strategies presented in this work could be further extended to other spinel compounds to achieve desired catalytic properties for chemical transformations of industrial interest.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhotocatalysis offers an energy‐efficient and sustainable solution to environmental pollution and energy shortages. The core of this process lies in photocatalysis. However, establishing a clear relationship between their structure and performance through traditional experimental methods is often time‐intensive and labor‐intensive. Machine learning (ML) has recently gained traction in guiding photocatalyst synthesis, though it is often challenged by limited data availability. This study introduces a dynamic ML‐guided approach that iteratively optimizes experimental parameters through successive cycles of ML analysis and experimentation, effectively circumventing the need for large datasets. Applied to the synthesis of photocatalysts via microwave heating of quercetin, this method yielded optimal performance after three iterations, achieving a high hydrogen peroxide production rate. This ML approach demonstrates an effective few‐shot ML optimization strategy for catalyst synthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUltrasound can remove bubbles and significantly enhance the performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its impact on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is minimal. Improving hydrophilicity has been found to address this issue. CoFeCr LDH/NF, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with good hydrophilicity and a nanoflower structure, is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Hydrophilicity affects the size of bubbles produced, with better hydrophilic electrodes generating smaller, more easily disrupted bubbles. The cavitation effect upon bubble rupture releases heat, breaking water molecules to produce free OH⁻ and promoting the reconstruction of CoFeCr LDH. Additionally, the nanoflower structure of CoFeCr LDH features numerous micropores, enhancing the surface roughness of NF, and resulting in more uniform bubble sizes. Solution convection induced by ultrasound gathers small bubbles into larger ones, which are more easily removed by ultrasound. At 30 mA cm−2, ultrasound reduces the overpotential for HER and OER by 17 mV and 16 mV, respectively. Enhanced hydrophilicity significantly improves the efficiency of CoFeCr LDH/NF in water electrolysis, especially in OER.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCO2 functionalization to afford beneficial products is one of the current scientific greatest challenges. Amongst all the possible transformations, the synthesis of formic acid from CO2 is of high interest due to the enormous industrial production of this chemical. Particularly interesting is the obtention of formic acid via transfer hydrogenation (TH) of CO2, allowing milder reaction conditions and eliminating the need to employ a hazardous gas as H2. Iridium catalysts promoted TH reactions have been widely studied; however, examples of TH to CO2 are very scarce. In our search for the development of new and more efficient catalysts, we have studied the ability of [IrCp*(QO)X] complexes (QO = 8‐oxyquinolinate) to promote TH to bicarbonate salts and CO2 to obtain formate salts. The study shows a crucial ligand effect, obtaining the best results when [IrCp*(5,7‐Me,Me‐QO)Cl] was employed. Under optimized conditions, TON values up to 135 and 60 were obtained for TH to bicarbonate salts, and CO2, respectively. Remarkably, [IrCp*(5,7‐Me,Me‐QO)Cl] is able to trap and transform atmospheric CO2 into formate salts.",

This necessitates the designing of highly active and stable Co‐based electrocatalysts for UOR. Herein, the influence of electronic modulation in the synthesized borophene–cobalt phosphate catalyst (B@CP) for generating active sites for UOR was studied. The addition of urea to the alkaline electrolyte as a sacrificial agent significantly reduced the potential required by B@CP for UOR compared to OER for attaining a fixed current density. B@CP achieved the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at potentials of 1.31 V and 1.40 V, respectively. Adding borophene to the catalyst also modified its morphology and charge transport, enhancing the UOR kinetics, reducing the charge transfer resistance, and exposing more electrochemically active sites. Moreover, B@CP displayed long‐term UOR stability for 50 h. This work will encourage the development of innovative strategies for tuning the properties of different transition metal‐based electrocatalysts via borophene for various energy conversion applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA new class of skeleton nickel catalysts with high activity and selectivity in the CO2 methanation reaction has been developed, where magnesium fluoride plays a structure‐forming component. The precursor for the skeleton catalyst is a binary magnesium–nickel fluoride solid solution (MgF2–NiF2), synthesized using the precipitation method from magnesium nitrate, nickel nitrate, and ammonium fluoride. Upon reduction at 500 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere, only nickel fluoride is reduced, while magnesium fluoride maintains its structure unchanged, forming the structural framework for nickel nanoparticles. The catalyst achieves a specific surface area of up to 87.2 m2g−1 and a nickel metal surface area of up to 3.06 m2g−1. The most active catalyst, containing 73.1 wt.% Ni can convert 73% of CO2 to methane, with a selectivity of nearly 98% and a carbon balance of 0.98 at 400 °C, under high GHSV = 20,000 h−1. Among the factors contributing to the high catalytic activity, the metallic surface area measured by hydrogen chemisorption, the content of metallic nickel, and the amount of hydroxyl groups were identified. A strong correlation with catalytic activity was also observed for the surface composition of the catalysts determined by XPS, including: (1) total nickel content, (2) metallic nickel content, (3) oxygen content, and (4) the atomic Ni/Mg ratio. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between the activity and the surface basicity of the catalysts as measured by the CO2‐TPD method.",

Chlorine atoms have been proposed as a catalyst to oxidize carbon monoxide through the formation of chloroformyl radicals (ClCO), removing O2 and ultimately generating CO2. However, relevant kinetic studies of this catalytic cycle are scarce and highly uncertain. In this work, we report the spectrum of the ClCO radical between 210–520 nm using a multipass UV–Vis spectrometer coupled to a pulsed-laser photolysis flow reactor at 236–294 K temperature and 50–491 Torr pressure ranges. High-level ab initio calculations were performed to simulate the observed spectrum and to investigate the electronic structure. In addition, we observed the formation of molecular chlorine, Cl2, and phosgene, Cl2CO, suggesting that both the terminal chlorine and the central carbon in the ClCO radical are reactive towards chlorine atoms. Most importantly, the reported spectrum will enable future measurements of essential kinetic parameters related to ClCO radicals, which are important in regulating the O2 abundance in Venus’s mesosphere.",

We present a straightforward method for achieving high-concentration and long-term stable graphene suspensions by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) via a combination of ammonia (NH3) as an easily removable additive together with low-boiling point, benign organic-water co-solvent mixtures as suspension media. We find that the addition of small amounts of NH3 as an additive drastically improves the obtainable LPE graphene concentrations by up to 2 orders of magnitude for a wide range of organic-water co-solvent mixtures including with isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone, ethylene glycol and tert-butanol. With our approach we readily reach current benchmark graphene concentration values of ~180 mg·L-1 that are normally only obtainable using hard-to-remove high-boiling-point and hazardous standard solvents like dimethylformamide and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolydone or with hard-to-remove surfactants. Notably, NH3 as an additive is highly volatile and thus, as we show, easily removable without degrading the produced high quality graphene nanosheets.",

A preferential lipid orientation can be determined for the 1,2-Dimyristoyl-glycero-3-methox-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DMG-PEG2k) molecule, by comparing the profiles of PEG to DMG fragments. PEG fragments are found immediately during analysis of the LNP surface, while the DMG fragments are deeper, coincident with RNA ions located in the core, in agreement with established models of LNPs.

Its activity can be controlled by ligands offering access to pharmacological Nurr1 modulation. However, the binding epitope(s) and molecular activation mechanisms of synthetic Nurr1 activators remained elusive but are essential to advance Nurr1 ligands towards new medicines. Here we characterized Nurr1 dimer dissociation and coregulator release as molecular contributions to Nurr1 activation by vidofludimus and locate its binding in an allosteric surface pocket lined by helices 1, 5, 7, and 8 by mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation. Structure-guided ligand design using these insights resulted in an optimized Nurr1 agonist with substantially enhanced potency and binding affinity. Our results provide a structural and molecular basis for Nurr1 activation by a synthetic agonist which was lacking for rational ligand design.",

These forces, termed reactive-orbital-based electrostatic forces, arise from the negative gradient of orbital energy, creating a direct connection between orbital energy variations and nuclear motion. Through the analysis of 48 representative reactions, we identify two predominant types of force behavior: reactions that sustain reaction-direction forces either from the early stages or just before the transition state. These forces carve grooves along the intrinsic reaction coordinates on the potential energy surface, shaping the reaction pathway. This clarifies which types of electron transfer contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. This study provides a framework for understanding the driving forces behind chemical transformations, offering insights into the electronic basis of reaction mechanisms.",

We reveal that continuous-wave laser irradiation yields single crystals of the metastable polymorph, whereas continued irradiation with high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser pulses induces poly-crystallization of the stable form. Crucially, by strategically alternating between these two laser modalities during crystal growth, we can open up new crystallization pathways, including the single crystal growth of the stable phase. These findings underscore the significant potential of focused laser beams for precision polymorphic engineering, paving the way for the development of advanced materials with tailored properties.",

By leveraging this reactivity, we developed a regiospecific synthesis of unsymmetrically 2,3-diaryl substituted indoles from three readily available feedstocks: an amine, an arylglyoxal, and a boronic acid. While traditional Petasis reactions with similar three-component inputs are typically applied to build C(sp3)-C(sp2) and C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds, the present transformation offers a special opportunity for constructing a C(sp2)-C(sp2) linkage. Highly substituted indole motifs with structural diversity in the C2 position are easily accessed by this three-component reaction.

Despite its significance, the mechanisms influencing ICD in molecular complexes remain unclear. Here, we investigate and unambiguously prove the ICD process in thiophene dimer, an aromatic ring with a third-row atom. Using multi-particle momentum coincidence spectroscopy, accompanied by high-level electronic structure calculations, we elucidate that the ICD process is initiated from the sulfur-containing inner-valence orbitals which are energetically below the Auger threshold. This leads to an enhancement in the emission of low-energy ICD electrons compared to other aromatic ring dimers. By utilizing this ‘ICD-only decay’ contribution we quantify ICD probabilities above the Auger threshold. This study reveals the pivotal role of sulfur in shaping the ICD electron spectrum, which can be implied to control the low-energy electron emission in biological systems.",

This approach combines experimental hypotheses with mathematical and physical models, enabling a concise description of complex system dynamics and the extraction of kinetic parameters like kinetic pathways, time constants, and species amplitudes. However, building the final kinetic model requires several intermediate steps, including testing various assumptions and models across multiple experiments. In complex cases, some intermediate states may be unknown and are often simplified. This approach requires expertise in modeling and data comprehension, as poor decisions at any stage during data analysis can lead to an incorrect kinetic model, resulting in inaccurate results. Here, we introduce DLRN, a new deep learning-based framework, designed to rapidly provide a kinetic reaction network, time constants, and amplitude for the system, with comparable performance and, in part, even better than a classical fitting analysis.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In the past few decades, tremendous attention has been devoted to enhancing the activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for hydrogen production, while the cost and long-term stability of catalysts, which can play an even more important role in industrialization, have been much less emphasized. Herein, we engineered an OER electrode from abundant stainless steel (SS) via facile approaches, and the obtained electrode consists of a Ni-rich oxide surface layer with a Fe-rich metal substrate. An outstanding activity was observed with an overpotential of 316 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, an electrode self-replenishing concept is proposed in which a Ni-rich catalyst layer can be regenerated from a metallic substrate due to the difference in diffusion and dissolution rates of metal oxides/hydroxides, and this regeneration is validated by various characterizations. A recorded degradation rate of 0.012 was observed at 1000 mA cm−2 for 1000 h. The facile engineering of OER electrodes from SS combined with the self-replenishing catalyst can potentially address the cost, activity, and long-term stability barriers.",

Here, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of single-cell mass spectrometry imaging (SC-MSI) via tapping-mode scanning probe electrospray ionization (t-SPESI), which is an atmospheric-pressure sampling ionization technique. We developed a novel t-SPESI unit that can be used in combination with an inverted fluorescence microscope and basic technologies to extract components from microregions of cells and measure ions with high sensitivity. We performed multimodal (fluorescence, lipid ion, and topographic) imaging of two types of HeLa cells labeled with fluorescent dyes and chemically fixed and showed the potential for subcellular-scale analysis of both cell structure and chemical composition. Furthermore, we evaluated the lipid species by comparing the SC-MSI results with those of supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The technical advancement presented here is effective for distinguishing cell types based on the signal intensity of lipid ions in single cells and investigating differences in the subcellular localization of lipids in different types of cells.",

Although OAD has been used for untargeted lipidomics, its availability has been limited to the positive ion mode, requiring the independent use of a collision-induced dissociation (CID) method. In this study, we demonstrated the OAD MS/MS technique in the negative-ion mode for profiling phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, and sulfatides, where the fragmentation mechanism remained consistent with that in the positive ion mode. Furthermore, we proposed optimal conditions for the simultaneous acquisition of CID- and OAD-specific fragment ions, termed OAciD, where oxygen atoms and hydroxy radicals facilitate C=C position-specific fragmentation, while residual water vapor induces cleavage of low-energy covalent bonds as observed in CID. Finally, theoretical fragment ions were implemented in MS-DIAL 5 to accelerate C=C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics. The OAciD methodology was used to illuminate brain region-specific marmoset lipidomes with C=C positional information, including the estimation of C=C positional isomer ratios. We also characterized the profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids, finding that lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids were enriched in the cerebellum, whereas those containing omega-6 fatty acids were more abundant in the hippocampus and frontal lobe.",

While NOS linkages in proteins were once assumed to occur only between lysine and cysteine, our investigation shows that these bonds extend beyond the well–studied lysine-NOS-cysteine examples. By systematically analyzing over 86,000 high–resolution X-ray protein structures, we uncovered 69 additional NOS bonds, including arginine-NOS-cysteine and glycine-NOS-cysteine. Our pipeline integrates machine learning, quantum–mechanical calculations, and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data to systematically detect these subtle covalent interactions and identify key predictive descriptors for their formation. The discovery of these previously unrecognized linkages broadens the scope of protein chemistry and may enable targeted modulation in drug design and protein engineering. Although our study focuses on NOS linkages, the flexibility of this methodology allows for the investigation of a wide range of chemical bonds and covalent modifications, including structurally resolvable posttranslational modifications (PTMs). By revisiting and re-examining well-established protein models, this work underscores how systematic data-driven approaches can uncover hidden aspects of protein chemistry and inspire deeper insights into protein function and stability.",

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL), generated from tryptic digestion of 42 human recombinant proteins, in enhancing the detection and quantification of lower-abundance cancer-associated proteins. Additionally, we generated a combined sample-specific biological-rPSL by integrating the rPSL with a spectral library derived from pooled biological samples. We compared the performance of these libraries for DIA data extraction with standard methods, including sample-specific biological spectral library and library-free DIA methods. Our specific focus was on quantifying cancer-associated proteins, including key enzymes involved in kynurenine pathway, across patient-derived tissues and cell lines. Both rPSL and biological-rPSL-DIA approaches provided significantly improved coverage of lower-abundance proteins, enhancing sensitivity and more consistent protein quantification across matched tumour and adjacent noncancerous tissues from breast and colorectal cancer patients and in cancer cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that rPSL and biological-rPSL coupled with DIA-MS workflows, can address the limitations of both biological library-based and library-free DIA methods, offering a robust approach for quantifying low-abundance cancer-associated proteins in complex biological samples.",

This paper describes experimental data and a prediction model for challenging CCS prediction tasks including longer peptides that tend to have higher charge states. The proposed model is based on a pretrained deep protein language model. While the conventional prediction model requires training from scratch, the proposed model enables training with less amount of time owing to the use of the pretrained model as a feature extractor. Results of experiments with the novel experimental data show that the proposed model succeeds in drastically reducing the training time while maintaining the same or even better prediction performance compared with the conventional method. Our approach presents the possibility of prediction on the basis of \"greener\" manner training of various peptide properties in proteomic liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry experiments.",

Gold Teaching and learning methods Undergraduates We can all remember back to our first forays into research. It was a process filled with wonder and confusion as we departed from the safe territory of problems with known solutions to the unknown world of asking (and trying to answer) entirely new questions. The experience was both empowering, showing us all the knowledge we have gained throughout our education, and deeply humbling as we struggled to apply this knowledge in different ways.One of the biggest challenges that new researchers face is the gap between the textbook level understanding they have gained in their coursework and the ways that these topics are pursued in cutting edge research in the field. This gap has undoubtedly always existed as no textbook can be entirely comprehensive or eternally up to date, but we have the sense that this gap has been widening in recent years. The gap is certainly large in interdisciplinary fields, where traditional courses or even entire study programs will not cover the range of topics required to be proficient in the field. But it seems that the gap is also widening in traditional disciplines as the publish or perish culture that has pervaded academia preferentially rewards output of top-level research articles over undergraduate textbooks.From the educational side, we can see the problem being addressed with an increasing shift toward research-based teaching, but we can also see that research-based teaching can and should be supported by a different style of publication tailored to these emerging researchers. Be they newly embarked on their research career or established researchers moving into new domains, all will benefit from a practical and pedagogical introduction to important topics for cutting edge research. We have seen the incredible appetite for these types of papers in the community with tutorials and user guides that have been published in recent years, (1−4) and this has encouraged us to officially highlight this type of publication with a new amendment to our information for authors across the nine ACS Au journals.In the short term, we offer a new type of publication, the \"Tutorial\", that we hope will help fill this gap in the literature. In the long term, we imagine collections of these tutorials that might provide a new way to effectively update textbooks, one chapter at a time.While the form and focus of an effective tutorial can vary significantly, we can suggest some guiding principles for authors embarking on this endeavor.Choosing a TopicClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The scope of a tutorial can either be relatively broad, e.g., an emerging field, or quite narrow, e.g., focused on a particular technique. A guiding principle is that it is a pedagogical introduction for a new reader in the area, providing information that cannot be found in a textbook or a research paper. Conceptual, Theoretical or PracticalA tutorial can encompass any and all of the aspects that are useful to bring a new reader into the field. In some instances, these can be important concepts that are difficult to draw out of the literature; in others, a theoretical description; and in many cases, a focus on practical execution, the how-to aspects of learning a new area. Feel free to use both the main text and the Supporting Information to educate the reader in how-to best practice. FAIR Data and CodeIn all cases, we strongly recommend making code and data available in association with the tutorial so that readers can immediately test play with the concept they are learning.We hope that both our readers and authors will enthusiastically embrace this change. It gives authors the opportunity to write the paper they wish they had been given when they entered the field and the paper they can and will hand out to prospective group members and use in their teaching to provide a gentler introduction to the world of their research. For our readers, we hope these papers will bridge the gap between the knowledge you already have and the research you want to do. Part of the privilege of being an open access journal is that we know these papers can reach readers, regardless of their circumstances, and we hope that we can provide a resource to inspire researchers wherever they are.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorGemma C.

(American Chemical Society) Synthetic polymers are highly customizable with tailored structures and functionality, yet this versatility generates challenges in the design of advanced materials due to the size and complexity of the design space. Thus, exploration and optimization of polymer properties using combinatorial libraries has become increasingly common, which requires careful selection of synthetic strategies, characterization techniques, and rapid processing workflows to obtain fundamental principles from these large data sets. Herein, we provide guidelines for strategic design of macromol. libraries and workflows to efficiently navigate these high-dimensional design spaces. We describe synthetic methods for multiple library sizes and structures as well as characterization methods to rapidly generate data sets, including tools that can be adapted from biol. workflows. We further highlight relevant insights from statistics and machine learning to aid in data featurization, representation, and anal. This perspective acts as a \"user guide\" for researchers interested in leveraging high-throughput screening toward the design of multifunctional polymers and predictive modeling of structure-property relationships in soft materials. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXisFWgtrbF&md5=13654acd9ef4a5920a79b0f820a80a87Cited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferences Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsACS Physical Chemistry AuCite this: ACS Phys.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical investigation involving electron collisions with cyanoacetylene is reported. Differential cross sections (DCSs), integral cross sections (ICSs), and momentum-transfer cross sections (MTCSs) for the elastic electron scattering were calculated using the Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method at the static-exchange plus polarization (SEP) level of approximation for energies ranging from 0.5 to 30 eV. The Schwinger variational method combined with Padé's approximants (SVPA), considering static-exchange-polarization plus absorption (SEPA), was also applied for impact energies from 0.1 to 1000 eV. These results were complemented by calculations performed according to the screen-corrected independent atom model (SCIAM). Furthermore, original measurements of absolute elastic (DCSs) at 20 eV were conducted in a crossed-beam apparatus. The theoretical results display an outstanding agreement with each other and an overall agreement with the calculated cross sections available in the literature. The agreement between the calculated and measured results is quite encouraging, further validating the thoroughness of the current research.",

ACS PublicationsPublished 2025 by American Chemical SocietySubjectswhat are subjectsArticle subjects are automatically applied from the ACS Subject Taxonomy and describe the scientific concepts and themes of the article.Chemistry educationGoldMaterialsPolymersUndergraduatesFor the last five years, ACS Publications has offered authors the ability to publish in two families of journals, our long-established family of journals that is available to readers through subscription as well as a newer family of open access (OA) journals where all published work is freely available to readers across the world. As part of the latter family of journals, the ACS Au open access journals were launched in 2021, greatly expanding ACS Publications' first forays into open access publishing that started with the launch of ACS Central Science (2015) and ACS Omega (2016). The ACS Au family of journals includes a large, selective multidisciplinary chemistry journal, JACS Au, serving as a companion to the flagship Journal of the American Chemical Society, and nine fully open access community focused journals covering the breadth of the chemical, biochemical, materials, environmental, and engineering disciplines.The launch of the ACS Au journal family further emphasizes ACS' commitment to supporting authors who choose, or are required by their funder, to publish in fully open access journals. As open access mandates continue to evolve around the world, we have continuously sought to provide authors with the options they need to publish their work in journals that feature high scientific rigor, thorough peer review, global impact and reach, and timely editorial decisions. Five years later, the journals are well-established and will continue to serve their communities as respected venues for high-quality research in chemistry and the allied fields.Recognizing that different authors have different accessibility to funding for Article Publication Charges (APCs), ACS also continues to support authors through the ACS special country pricing policy and ACS Read and Publish Agreements. Read and Publish agreements help institutions sustainably support the transition to open access, by growing the amount of work published open access, while also providing full access to ACS subscription content. Over the past five years, the number of ACS Read and Publish Agreements has expanded substantially, from covering 125 institutes in seven countries in 2019 to over 1,600 institutes across 46 countries in 2024 (Figure 1). 2024 also saw the establishment of first-of-their-kind \"Read and Green\" agreements to further expand the open access options ACS Publications provides for authors. We are delighted that ACS remains committed to expanding these agreements, enabling more authors to publish their work open access and for it to be available to anyone, anywhere in the world.Figure 1Figure 1. Growth of ACS Read and Publish Agreements since 2019.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWith such widespread and continually expanding coverage by Read and Publish agreements, authors based at many institutions around the world are choosing to publish open access even when their institutions or funding agencies do not require it. This is because open access papers and journals offer wider accessibility of published work, and authors naturally seek the broadest possible audience for their research products. Evidence for the increased usage can be seen in Figure 2, where the usage of hybrid ACS publications journals is dominated by researchers in East Asia and the Pacific (53%), the Western Hemisphere (21%), and Europe (19%), whereas usage of the Au family of journals includes a much stronger presence of readers in South Asia (15% vs 6% hybrid), the Middle East and North Africa (4.5% vs 1.2% hybrid), and Africa (1.5% vs 0.4% hybrid). All ten ACS Au journals received their inaugural full Journal Impact Factors (JIF) in the 2024 Journal Citation Reports, and with usage and citations continuing to grow year-on-year, it is anticipated that the momentum will continue as more researchers embrace open access publishing.Figure 2Figure 2. Global usage comparison of papers published in the ACS hybrid journal portfolio vs ACS gold open access journal portfolio 2021–2024.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe fully open access ACS Au journals have evolved to be highly author-centric. For instance, as a new journal, JACS Au is more than 10-fold smaller than the well-established Journal of the American Chemical Society, which allows our editorial team to invest substantial time understanding the nuance of each submission. In parallel, the Au community journals focus strongly on serving the needs of their respective scientific communities. As scientific communities are diverse, there have been numerous strategies employed to meet the needs of authors across the ten Au journals. For example, several editorials have been published across the portfolio that support authors by providing writing tips (DOI: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.2c00030), educating the community about giving proper CRediT (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.2c00029), and providing strategies for improving the visibility of publications (DOI: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00029). We have also leaned into the artistic creativity of our authors through editorials helping them with strategies for making cover art, and we have actively participated in the ACS Publications DEIR cover art series (DOIs: 10.1021/acsbiomedchemau.2c00028; 10.1021/acsorginorgau.2c00060; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00060; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00707; 10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00042; 10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00034; 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.4c00009). As the Au journals started during the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned quickly that a feeling of community is important for chemists and that our communities were looking for more than just advice on publishing. To this end, we have also provided editorials focused on mental health (10.1021/acspolymersau.2c00062) and strategies for fostering healthy, inclusive research ecosystems (10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00069; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00056).Another author- and reader-centric activity has been our focus on chemical education. Chemical education is critically important to the future of all chemists and our chemistry discipline, but traditionally, this topic has been primarily represented within the ACS Publications portfolio in the Journal of Chemical Education. The Au family of journals has the benefit that all content is available to anyone, anywhere in the world. Embracing this global reach, we have sought to publish interesting and innovative work on the pedagogy and scholarship of chemical education as well as new training materials of interest and value to researchers and educators across the globe who may not have access to ACS content through subscription. We have sought to ensure that the chemical education research community has a welcoming place to publish their latest research (DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00227; 10.1021/jacsau.3c00192), and we have supported the field through editorials and resources for educators. We have highlighted new teaching materials and cooperatives that help educators get the support and materials they need (DOIs: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.1c00020; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00014), and we have published open access tutorials and methods/protocols that can be used directly as alternatives or supplements to costly textbooks in undergraduate and graduate courses (DOIs: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00070; 10.1021/jacsau.4c00979). Finally, ACS has made a commitment to chemical educators at primarily undergraduate educational institutions with an ACS-sponsored Read and Publish agreement that waives the APC so that chemists can publish undergraduate research at over 170 institutions across the United States.Growing visibility and building relationships with the scientific communities we serve have been crucial for the ACS Au portfolio in these formative years. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to grow the number and diversity of publications in the journals and to celebrate this great content. It was also important to us that researchers at all career stages felt like they were represented. We have established an Early Career Advisory Board at JACS Au and the \"Rising Stars\" Special Issue series in the ACS Au community journals. Initiatives highlighting the researchers shaping the future of their fields will continue to be a feature of the Au journals into our future.As we close out this editorial, we would be remiss not to thank the numerous individuals and groups that have contributed to the growth and success of the Au family of journals. This includes our retired Editors and recently appointed Editors (Tables 1 and 2), as well as our dozens of dedicated Editorial Advisory Board members across the family of Au journals. We thank the authors who boldly submitted papers to our journals in the early days when global understanding of OA publishing was still limited, as well as our repeat authors who now, after five years, have published with us numerous times, in some cases more than a half dozen papers across the last four years. Finally, we have to thank all our referees. Peer review is the backbone of rigorous scientific publishing, and manuscripts published by ACS Publications are the most trusted, most cited, and most read because of the quality of our peer reviews and peer reviewers. Thank you to all the reviewers who have helped make the Au family of journals thrive.Table 1.

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the structural changes of lithium borate (LiB) glass 25Li2O-(75 - x)B2O3 was conducted in the absence and presence of lead(II) oxide or aluminum oxide (x = 10 mol %) glass modifiers. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were used to explore the structural properties of LiB glass by incorporating trace amounts of manganese(III) oxide (0.00-0.25 mol %) as a probe. Differential thermal analysis and XRD results for the glasses and their ceramics confirmed the integration of aluminum atoms into the glass framework by forming a lithium aluminum boron oxide Li2(AlB5O10) crystalline phase. Lead atoms were located interstitially, which disordered the borate glass structure and produced a lithium tetraborate crystalline phase. Semiempirical modeling of the glass structures was conducted to estimate the fundamental vibrational modes of the glass materials using a parametric method 3 (PM3MM) with molecular mechanics corrections to elucidate the geometry of the borate (BO3) groups and their possible vibrational modes. Our analysis revised the conventional representation of the tetrahedral BO4 units, which were not observed, to \"distorted-trigonal\" BO3 groups and associated with nonbridging oxygen (NBO) atoms. EPR spectroscopy established a link between the NBO in oxides and the well-defined peak at g-factor ∼4.2 in glass materials, which had been assigned to iron(III) ions according to the literature.",

    "abstract": "The kinetics of oxygen exchange dictate the rate of redox reactions, which is crucial for electrochemical-based sustainable technologies. In this study, we use isotope exchange pulse responses to elucidate the oxygen exchange mechanism for (Bi0.8Tm0.2)2O3-δ (BTM)-(La0.8Sr0.2)0.99MnO3-δ (LSM) composites. With an optimized composition and microstructure, these composites can achieve polarization resistances below 0.01 Ω·cm2 at 700 °C. Analysis of the oxygen exchange rate, , by splitting it into elementary processes using the serial two-step scheme, demonstrates that both the dissociative adsorption and incorporation of oxygen are accelerated in BTM-LSM compared to the parent phases. Dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen is rate-limiting below 900 °C in the range 0.002-0.05 atm O2 and below 850 °C in 0.21 atm O2. Cation interdiffusion or changes in the electronic structure at the interface between the two materials create an electrocatalytically active region spanning 1-40 nm around the BTM-LSM phase boundary. Oxygen exchange coefficients within this region were estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of the entire composite surface. We propose two potential pathways for oxygen exchange in BTM-LSM, with calculated p O2 dependencies for each rate-determining step (rds). The p O2 dependency of reveals that molecular oxygen is involved in the rds.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the low-temperature behavior of concentrated aqueous solutions of cesium chloride and discover two hydrates of CsCl. We employ four different methods, namely, (i) simple cooling at rates between 0.5 and 80 K s–1, (ii) simple cooling followed by pressurization, (iii) hyperquenching at 106 to 107 K s–1, and (iv) hyperquenching followed by pressurization. Depending on the method, different types of phase behaviors are observed, which encompass crystallization involving freeze-concentration, pressure-induced amorphization, full vitrification, and polyamorphic transformation. The CsCl hydrates discovered in our work cold-crystallize above 150 K upon heating after ultrafast vitrification (routes iii and iv) and show melting temperatures below the eutectic temperature of 251 K. We determine the composition of these hydrates to be CsCl·5H2O and CsCl·6H2O and find evidence for their existence in ESEM, calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. The dominant and less metastable hydrate is the hexahydrate, where the pentahydrate appears as a minority species. We also reveal the birthplace for the CsCl hydrates, namely, the freeze-concentrated solution (FCS) formed upon cold-crystallization of the fully glassy solution (from iii and iv). The spongy FCS produced upon cooling of the liquid (from i and ii) is incapable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. By contrast, the FCS produced upon heating the glassy solution (from iii and iv) shows tiny, fine features that are capable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. Our findings contradict the current knowledge that alkali chlorides only have hydrates for the smaller cations Li+ and Na+, but not for the larger cations K+, Rb+, and Cs+ and pave the way for future determination of CsCl-hydrate crystal structures. The pathway to metastable crystalline materials outlined here might be more generally applicable and found in nature, e.g., in comets or on interstellar dust grains, when glassy aqueous solutions crystallize upon heating.",

Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F + H2 system and its isotopic variant F + HD.

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic chemicals found in numerous industrial applications and everyday products. The excessive amounts of PFASs in water and soil, together with their link to severe health issues, have prompted substantial public concerns, making their removal from the environment a necessity. Existing degradation techniques are frequently lacking due to their low efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and potential for secondary contamination. Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) technology has emerged as a promising alternative, utilizing energized reactive species to break down PFASs under ambient conditions. Therefore, this review examines the efficacy and effectiveness of CAP in degrading PFASs by reviewing various CAP setups and examining the key factors involved. This review also aims to further the development of CAP as a viable solution for PFAS degradation by addressing outstanding challenges and future directions in soil and water treatment.",

    "abstract": "Thermal management in molecular systems presents challenges that require a deeper understanding of phonon transport, an essential aspect of heat conduction in single-molecule junctions. Our work introduces the use of heavy atoms as a strategy for suppressing phonon transport in organic molecules. Starting with a one-dimensional (1D) force-constant model and density functional theory calculations of model chemical systems, we illustrate how increasing the mass of a central atom affects phonon transmission and conductance. Following this, we turned our attention to the chemically accessible systems of metallapolyynes and extended metal atom chains (EMACs). Our findings suggest that several of the studied EMACs exhibit thermal conductance either near or below a recently proposed threshold of 10 pW/K─a crucial step toward reaching high thermoelectric figure of merits. Specifically, we predict that the molecule MoMoNi(npo)4(NCS)2 has a thermal conductance of just 8.3 pW/K at 300 K. Our results demonstrate that conceptually simple chemical modifications can markedly reduce the thermal conductance of single molecules; these results both deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving single-molecule phonon thermal conductance and suggest a path toward using single molecules as thermoelectric materials.",

Here, we prepared a Pd(II) platina(II)corrole bipyridyl complex, which was converted to the corresponding stable Pt(IV) complex upon oxidation with iodobenzene dichloride. Oxidation of the platinum center did not result in the C-C bond formation between two pyrrole units via reductive elimination. The X-ray diffraction analysis of these complexes elucidated their nonplanar molecular structures. The nonaromatic nature of platina(II)- and platina(IV)corroles was revealed by 1H NMR analysis and NICS calculations.",

The crystal structure of EuHg revealed a heteropolymeric 1-D structure, with cationic acetate-bridged and anionic bromide-bridged chains forming parallel arrays; IR, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopic data of LnPb strongly suggested similarity with the LnHg compounds. The analogous reaction with EuCl3·6H2O and Hg(OAc)2 forms an isostructural material, but substituting Pb(OAc)2 generates [Eu(OAc)2(OH2)3]Cl and PbCl2 instead of a mixed-metal product comparable to LnPb. An N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate [Eu(OAc)2(DMF)3](PbBr3)] (EuPb·DMF) was structurally characterized, showing the same heteropolymeric motif as EuHg and resembling an organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskite due the anionic chain of face-sharing bromoplumbate(II) octahedra. Photoluminescence properties of the compounds, including lifetime measurements and Tb(III)→Eu(III) energy transfer parameters for the LnM 50:50 Eu/Tb solid-solutions are described.",

A high-throughput differential cell viability assay using colon cancer cell lines was developed to identify natural product modulators of TOP3B-associated cancer cell viability. The assay identified an organic extract of the plant Centratherum punctatum as having cytotoxic activity. Seven new furanoheliangolides, centratherolides A-G (1-7), along with two known analogues (2,3-epoxybutyryloxy)-goyazensolanolide (8) and goyazensolide (9), were isolated. Compounds 1, 8, and 9 exhibited selective cytotoxic activities against the TOP3B-knockout (TOP3B-KO) human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells compared with the wild-type HCT116 cells (TOP3B-WT). The challenging absolute configuration determination of the flexible chiral side chains in selected analogues (1-4 and 8) was resolved by combined approaches, including synthesis of chemical standards, DFT ECD calculation, and chiral HPLC analysis. Application of this elucidation methodology to a commercial sesquiterpene lactone clarified a contradiction in the stereochemical assignments reported for centaurepensin/chlorohyssopifolin A and 17-epi-chlorohyssopifolin A.",

    "abstract": "Essential trace metals are vital for cellular processes, such as respiration, DNA replication, and photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria must tightly regulate metal homeostasis to prevent deficiency or toxicity, yet their metallophores remain overlooked. Here, we report lusichelins A-E (1-5), new metallophores isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lusitaniella coriacea LEGE 07167. Their structures and configurational assignments were determined by using NMR, mass spectrometry, TD-DFT calculations, and retrobiosynthetic insights. Lusichelins feature a unique structural arrangement with thiazoline/thiazole rings connected via a vinyl group, an aliphatic carbon chain, or directly enabling the potential for metal coordination. Genomic analysis identified a hybrid PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with the lusichelin structure, bearing traits characteristic of metallophore biosynthesis. Functionally, lusichelins act as metallophores capable of chelating both iron and copper. Lusichelin C (3) consistently bound iron under both metal-rich and metal-limited culture conditions, while copper complexation was only observed under elevated copper levels. At physiologically relevant pH values, no significant metal-binding preference was detected. Moreover, compound production was maximized under metal-rich conditions and in response to copper limitation. Lusichelin B (2) exhibited cytotoxicity against colon carcinoma cells while reversing multidrug resistance via ABCB1 efflux pump modulation. These findings expand our understanding of cyanobacterial metallophores in microbial metal homeostasis and highlight their biological potential.",

    "abstract": "Fusarihexins C-E, a group of cyclodepsipeptides that contain a characteristic 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (HICA) residue, were recently isolated from the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. The absolute stereochemistry of HICA was determined to be R in fusarihexin C using a modified Mosher's method. It was assumed that HICA in fusarihexins D and E would have the same configuration, as they are derived from the same biological source. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structures of fusarihexins D and E as well as three new analogues. The compounds were synthesized by employing solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and high dilution macrolactamization and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Comparing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of synthesized and natural compounds revealed that the HICA residue has the S-configuration in fusarihexin D. The antiplasmodium activity on Plasmodium falciparum and antitumor activity against MCF7 and A431 cells were also investigated. Encouragingly, fusarihexin D (with S-HICA) displayed potent antiplasmodium activity by interfering with the ring stage of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite life cycle (IC50 at 650 nM).",

The results highlight the advantages of (7S,7'S,8'S)-2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan, (-)-γ-diisoeugenol. A series of derivatives with effective absolute configurations were synthesized with high stereoselectivity via intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reactions, and biological assays were performed. The most effective compound identified in this research was the (4-OCH3, 5-OCH3, 3'-CF3, 4'-OH)-derivative (EC50 = 8.6 μM). The combination of a hydrophobic group at the 3'-position and a phenolic hydroxy group at the 4'-position was crucial for the high activity. The 8'-epimer of the effective (7S,7'S,8'S)-2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan compound was also prepared by stereoselective hydrogenation of the 7-8' internal alkene. Thus, a novel anti-phytopathogenic fungal 2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan-type indane was developed.",

Mass spectrometry-based molecular networking and other advanced computational data mining techniques were employed to explore the chemical space of natural AETX derivatives. We identified a total of 43 biosynthetic intermediates and derivatives of AETX, including several iodinated derivatives, a rare halogenation in specialized metabolites of freshwater organisms. Structural characterization of these metabolites showed that most of them are AETX derivatives with varying substitution patterns of the bromo or iodo substituents, but also, AETX biosynthetic intermediates and other biindole derivatives were detected. Cytotoxicity assays of two isolated derivatives and AETX showed that they differ markedly in their activity.",

    "abstract": "Cordyceps militaris is a valuable edible and medicinal fungus. Its chemical composition and biological activity have become the focus of attention. In this study, three unusual C30 ergosterols, cordycepsterols A-C (1-3), have been isolated from this fungus. Their structures have been identified according to extensive spectroscopic methods as well as computational quantum chemistry. They possess an unusual 6/6/6/5/6-fused pentacyclic system which might be derived from a normal ergosterol backbone by adding two skeletal carbons. Compounds 1-3 exhibit significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide production with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 3.0, 0.9, and 2.3 μM, respectively. They could significantly suppress the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 at the concentration of 5 μM, which indicated that C. militaris and its cordycepsterols A-C have a potential anti-inflammatory application prospect.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived natural products are commonly consumed orally and can be structurally modified by the gut microbiota, potentially altering their biological activity. However, high-throughput studies on their microbial metabolism remain limited. This study applied an in vitro screening system for microbiome-derived metabolism using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolism of 200 natural products by human gut microbiota, and successfully annotated 118 natural products metabolized by gut microbiota. For the first time, metabolic reactions of isorhynchophylline and wilforgine in the intestine were documented. Notably, a substantial increase in the plasma concentration of isocorynoxeine was observed in human microbiota-colonized rats following isorhynchophylline administration compared to those without colonization, suggesting that the dehydrogenation of isorhynchophylline by gut microbiota observed in the in vitro screening system also occurs in vivo. 16S rRNA gene sequencing further revealed an increased abundance of Klebsiella and Escherichia-Shigella following isorhynchophylline administration, suggesting that these genera may influence its microbial transformation or pharmacological activity.",

However, the stereochemical complexity of 2,5-DKPs presents challenges in chemical synthesis, particularly concerning indole derivatives such as indole diketopiperazines (IDKPs). Prenylation and oxidation further diversify these structures, enhancing their bioactivity and membrane affinity. Despite recent advances, the biosynthetic pathways of IDKPs, especially those involving dual prenylation, remain inadequately understood. In this study, the fellutanine biosynthetic gene cluster from Nannizzia fulva was cloned and heterologously expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. A partially oxidized intermediate in the fellutanine biosynthetic pathway was characterized. The dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS) enzyme FelB was shown to catalyze consecutive prenylations at two C-2 positions of cyclo(l-Trp-l-Trp) in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Additionally, comparative studies with the known DMATS enzyme OkaC revealed differences in the regioselectivity. Furthermore, the biprenylation mechanism of FelB and OkaC was elucidated through molecular docking and active site analysis.",
