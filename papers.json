    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest owing to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.",

However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (k\n            cat = 13 s−1, >1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Quantum-confined nanoclusters can be described by the jellium model, which emphasizes closed-shell electron configurations, but an open-shell variation with jellium aromaticity has been proposed. Such clusters are termed superatoms because they behave like an atom, and they exhibit unusual properties. Superatoms feature metal–metal bonding; hence, since their discovery 40 years ago, superatoms have exclusively involved main group or transition metals, with actinides only considered computationally as dopants owing to actinide–actinide bonding being exceedingly rare. Here we report trithorium nanoclusters exhibiting three-centre-one-electron actinide–actinide bonding. Experimental and computational analysis demonstrates Robin–Day Class III 6d-orbital valence delocalization in these clusters. These S = 1/2 clusters are paramagnetic, but in external applied magnetic fields they exhibit exalted diamagnetism, evidencing actinide open-shell jellium aromaticity superatom character. Exalted diamagnetism is not normally associated with a single unpaired electron, but with a 1S\n            1 magic number, the valence delocalization enables exalted diamagnetism, which is aromaticity, via superatom ring currents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Transcriptional regulation is a dynamic process that coordinates diverse cellular activities, and the use of small molecules to perturb gene expression has propelled our understanding of the fundamental regulatory mechanisms. However, small molecules typically lack the spatiotemporal precision required in highly non-invasive, controlled settings. Here we present the development of a cell-permeable small-molecule DNA G-quadruplex (G4) binder, termed G4switch, that can be reversibly toggled on and off by visible light. We have biophysically characterized the light-mediated control of G4 binding in vitro, followed by cellular, genomic mapping of G4switch to G4 targets in chromatin to confirm G4-selective, light-dependent binding in a cellular context. By deploying G4switch in living cells, we show spatiotemporal control over the expression of a set of G4-containing genes and G4-associated cell proliferation. Our studies demonstrate a chemical tool and approach to interrogate the dynamics of key biological processes directly at the molecular level in cells.",

    "abstract": "For many slow solar-fuel-forming reactions, the accumulation of photogenerated minority carriers on the photoelectrode surface leads to light-induced band edge unpinning, affecting the junction properties by decreasing band bending in the semiconductor space charge layer and increasing the driving force of surface reactions in the electric double layer. In this study, we demonstrate a contactless operando electric field-induced second harmonic generation (EFISH) method for measuring the band bending change (δΔΦSCRL) on photoelectrodes upon photoexcitation. For n-doped rutile TiO2 water oxidation photoanodes at pH 7, δΔΦSCRL increases at more positive potentials or higher illumination power density until it reaches saturation values. We show that under fast mass transport conditions, δΔΦSCRL is exclusively attributed to the accumulated charged rate-determining species that can be regarded as temporary surface states, and the relationship between the photocurrent and δΔΦSCRL can be well modeled by assuming that hole trap states function as the reaction center. Kinetic isotope experiments identify proton-coupled electron transfer as the rate-determining step and suggest a possible chemical nature of the key intermediate. We demonstrate that light-induced band edge unpinning is a beneficial feature under high illumination conditions for oxygen evolution reaction on TiO2 because it maintains the photon-to-current conversion efficiency by enhancing the surface reaction driving force, shedding light on the actual device application.",

    "abstract": "Non-classical electromechanical properties, such as large electrostriction stress coefficient and low dielectric constant in Zr-doped ceria and other doped cerium oxides, discovered in the last several years, are the focus of intense research as they indicate the existence of solids with unusually large anharmonicity of chemical bonds. Theoretical models of electrostriction mechanisms rely on the concept of elastic dipoles that are formed due to the local structural distortions around dopants. The structural, dynamic, and electronic descriptors of the pre-existing (at zero field) dipoles (as in aliovalent-doped ceria) and those dynamically formed under the electric field (as in isovalent-doped ceria) are unknown. Here, the characteristics of the local structure and dynamics of the dopant and host bonding environments were obtained by using the temperature-dependent X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The candidate set of descriptors was identified in a quasiharmonic approximation for the nearest neighboring bonds between Zr (Ce) and the atoms in the first and second coordination shells. The descriptors included static bond length disorder, the anharmonicity of the effective pair potential, and effective force constants for the probed atomic pairs. The observation of significant Zr-O bond anharmonicity confirms previous first-principles calculations. The structural model, emerging from these simulations, emphasizes significant free volume around Zr in the oxygen cube, explaining both the mechanical anomaly (the decrease in Young's modulus with Zr concentration) as well as correlating at least one descriptor (static disorder) to the measured electrostriction coefficient. This descriptor-based approach can be extended to studies under applied electric fields or stress in this and other materials.",

    "abstract": "The functionality of materials is intrinsically linked to their structures, an axiom encapsulated in the principle of structure-property relationships. The pinnacle of materials design is the tailoring of its structure for a specific function, which requires the ability of rational synthesis and the development of synthesis science. This idea, however, remains elusive for the synthesis of complex extended solids. A major obstacle is the difficulty in using established chemical principles selectively to control reaction paths and favor certain structural patterns over numerous other possible results. In this context, we are developing a synthesis science approach that facilitates the control of the structure and bonding to create new structures. This is achieved by employing a two-component flux consisting of mixed hydroxides and halides as the reaction medium. This enables reaction conditions that allow better control of the structure dimensionality and composition by manipulating the temperature and solvent basicity (via the flux component ratio). We demonstrate the efficacy of this method in controlling their structural motifs to arrive at 23 unreported compositions and 6 unique structure types. These materials are expected to exhibit a broad range of properties, from metallic to semiconducting, with calculations suggesting the potential for emergent phenomena such as Dirac semimetals. The reaction paths afforded by these mixed fluxes establish a direct correlation between the synthetic variables and properties, providing significant insight into a broadly applicable approach for new materials.",

For dienes and dienophiles, most people will naturally use them to carry out the classic Diels-Alder reaction to construct six-membered cyclic compounds. Here, we demonstrated a chemoselective coupling of butadiene with dienophiles through stereoselective 1,3-cyclotelomerization. By utilizing robust Ni/IPr catalysis, valuable bicyclic products were created with high regio- and chemoselectivities under mild conditions. Asymmetric cyclotelomerization enabled by the chiral NHC ligand was also performed, generating enantioenriched bicyclic compounds. The reaction mechanism was also investigated via experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which indicate that the reaction might start with oxidative cyclometalation between two molecules of 1,3-diene and Ni(0) species, followed by a [3 + 2]-cycloaddition between nickelacycle and dienophile. The products can undergo a variety of intricate transformations, which emphasizes the potential applications of this strategy. It is hoped that the discovery of this protocol will further inspire people to rethink classic organic reactions.",

    "abstract": "Molecule-based magnetic materials have been identified as promising candidates for application in magnonic technologies, owing not only to their solution processability but also because they can exhibit narrow ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths and low Gilbert damping coefficients─crucial prerequisites for the transmission of coherent magnons over macroscopic distances. In particular, V(TCNE)2, a compound with a three-dimensional network structure composed of vanadium(II) centers linked by tetracyanoethylene (TCNE•-) radical anions, displays magnonic properties comparable to yttrium iron garnet, the quintessential magnonic material in the field. However, existing solution and chemical vapor deposition methods for synthesizing V(TCNE)2 require the use of highly reactive zero-valent molecular vanadium precursors, stymying research on this important material. Herein, we report a facile electrochemical method for the deposition of thin films of V(TCNE)2 using readily obtainable and stable divalent vanadium precursors and TCNE•- anions generated by electrochemical reduction. Magnetization measurements reveal that the films exhibit ferrimagnetic ordering above room temperature, consistent with V(TCNE)2 films synthesized via other methods. Moreover, the electrodeposited films exhibit narrow FMR linewidths as low as 17.5 G and a low Gilbert damping coefficient of 1.1 × 10-3, values that are on par with some currently integrated metallic magnonic materials. More generally, these results demonstrate that electrodeposition can provide a straightforward means of generating high-performance magnonic materials using readily available molecular precursors.",

    "abstract": "Lithium‐sulfur batteries emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in under achievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focusses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides towards capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides along with future directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio‐economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive and specific in situ virus detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)‐based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN‐based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV‐RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV‐RNA within 12 min in a cell‐free environment, enabling real‐time imaging of JEV‐RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN‐based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.",

During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first‐shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chain.",

Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti‐counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties.

This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent‐colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf‐like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via π‐electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.",

The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB‐OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%.

Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3·(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3·(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3·(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of H3Al·(NMP)1.0 through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. Importantly, H3Al·(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well‐defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased polydispersity and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.",

While cryo‐electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric αSyn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod‐like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid‐state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C‐terminal domain of the monomeric αSyn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C‐terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C‐terminal domain that influences aSyn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of αSyn.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts on a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and ageing. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerisation is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. Aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. To this end, the UV‐denaturation experiment developed at the B23 beamline of the Diamond Light Source (UK) is employed, which high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beamlight induce protein denaturation when repeated consecutive synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra are acquired in the far‐UV region, diagnostic of protein folding. This allows the estimation of protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV‐denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light‐induced damage to proteins.",

The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of ¹O₂ following its photo‐catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to ¹O₂ through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500‐fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 µs and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high‐surface charge (>+30 mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary “proof of principle” staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs.

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT•Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N‐dimethylformamide, and water, the UV‐visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50–100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 – 14 × 109 M−2). While the formation of charge‐transfer states through ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal‐bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl‐type reaction involving both 1,4‐aryl‐ and 1,2‐aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation‐ and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation‐ or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.",

Recently, nitrogen‐based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C‐C=C‐C‐N framework along with C=C‐C=C‐C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E–Z photoisomerization but also the 6π‐photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes. The symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical diarylethenes and satisfied the Woodward‐Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in diarylethenes, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the 6π‐photocyclization.",

Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis‐1,2‐diaminocyclohexane (cis‐DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis‐DACH with 3‐(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com­plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis‐DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol‐% only. The achiral cis‐DACH salan catalyst showed syn‐selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)‐citronellene, and (R)‐linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti‐selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti‐selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)‐citronellene and (R)‐linalool when the \"matched\" enantiomer of the chiral \"Berkessel salalen ligand\" is employed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N‐alkyl‐N, N′‐diarylhydrazines by boronic acid‐catalyzed one‐pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N–N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation‐sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late‐stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Brønsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Brønsted acid and H‐bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate‐limiting step.",

In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine‐based COFs, yielding TFPT‐sp2c‐COF, with a C═C linkage and TFPT‐IM‐COF, with a C═N linkage. TFPT‐sp2c‐COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT‐IM‐COF. More importantly, the C═C linkage in TFPT‐sp2c‐COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C═N linkage in TFPT‐IM‐COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and π‐delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT‐sp2c‐COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT‐IM‐COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGlycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror‐image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the “glycan code” enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D‐ and L‐sugars. Herein, we present an in‐depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin–glycan recognition, using the well‐characterized human C‐type lectin Dendritic cell‐specific ICAM‐3‐grabbing nonintegrin (DC‐SIGN) as a model. By combining experimental (STD‐NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC‐SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2⁺‐coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L‐fucose and D‐mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC‐SIGN also binds α/β‐L‐galactose, α/β‐D‐rhamnose, and myo‐inositol. Among these, α/β‐D‐rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than α‐OMe‐D‐mannose, while α/β‐L‐galactose binds more strongly than D‐rhamnose and myo‐inositol, although with lower affinity than α‐OMe‐L‐fucose.

Therefore, diameter selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present novel approach for size‐tunable diameter separation of single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal‐coordinating supramolecular polymers (M‐PNB) consisting of phenanthroline‐based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M‐PNB is confirmed by TEM analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 – 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 – 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M‐PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)‐SWNTs. This method offers not only size‐tunable diameter selectivity, but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency, and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.",

Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal‐organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex‐responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptical silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent‐colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex‐induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.",

NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand's versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. In addition, π‐interactions between the cation and the cation‐facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from π‐interactions with both cation‐facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These π‐interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.",

Divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. We report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H‐bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide‐sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H‐bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H‐bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H‐bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine‐bound CYP119 to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. We show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate‐Fe bond than the pyrrolidine‐bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H‐bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results suggest thiolate H‐bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.",

In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into ∆fdxC and ∆fdxN R. capsulatus‐deletion strains under N2‐fixing conditions, showed that plasmid‐based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe‐nitrogenase activity in both ∆fdxC and ∆fdxN strains, whilst plasmid‐based fdxC expression could only complement the ∆fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen‐bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]‐cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, whilst providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2‐fixation.",

However, to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology‐based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from peptide‐based delivery systems, as well as cutting‐edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.",

The fluorophore exhibits Crystallization‐Induced Emission Enhancement and pH‐dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of non‐emissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited‐State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state, and rationalized the large Stokes’ shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli‐responsive properties.",

    "abstract": "Low‐dimensional halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for single‐component white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in two‐dimensional (2D) systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange‐red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+‐induced extrinsic self‐trapped exciton (STE) which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange‐red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%‐51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation‐dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high‐performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.",

    "abstract": "Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4'‐azopyridine with long‐chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light‐responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerisation of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher‐intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure imparts deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light‐sensitive molecular components through covalent synthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe recently renovated two‐chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of α‐helix‐rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different‐type two‐chain protein, that is, bromelain inhibitor VI (BI‐VI), which has abundant β‐sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)‐ and light (L)‐chains of BI‐VI were mixed at 4 °C in a pH of 10.0 buffer solution containing 2 mM GSH and 0.4 mM GSSG, native BI‐VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53%) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI‐VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non‐activity. The rate‐limiting step of the two‐chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three‐SS intermediates of the H‐chain (3SSH) and one‐SS intermediates of the L‐chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multichain proteins with more complicated SS‐bond topologies.",

To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide‐ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid‐catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity‐adjustable structure is generated, which not only addresses the conductivity–toughness trade‐off of AEM but also possesses high OH− conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98 V (pure water) and 1.62 V (1 M KOH) at 1 A cm−2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high‐performance AEMWE.",

    "abstract": "The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate‐dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde‐ketone cross‐coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large‐scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2‐oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy‐2‐propanone to the product 2‐hydroxy‐2‐methyl‐1‐phenoxypentan‐3‐one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single‐point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (>90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2‐oxopentanoate, the double variant K567S_Y297P showed a 5‐fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.",

The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E‐ and the metastable Z‐isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV‐Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, e.g. to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic‐to‐isotropic phase transition upon irradiation",

    "abstract": "AbstractPROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain‐containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family‐related targets, for example, BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non‐BET proteins were reported so far. Among them, BRD9 was recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9‐targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3‐a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL‐based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.",

Compared to traditional batch processes, our flow approach enables the use of a single organolithium reagent and operates efficiently at 0 °C, avoiding the cool-warm-cool temperature cycles typical of batch methods.

In this method, Na2HPO4 was used to form hydrogen bonds with the C3 hydroxyl group of α-glucoside, thereby generating C3 free radicals, and p-cyanobenzaldehyde was used to dehydrogenate the free radical intermediates to achieve site-selective oxidation. This approach achieves a high selectivity for both glycosidic bond configurations and glycosylated forms. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through single-electron transfer and radical coupling with the quinuclidine playing a key role in hydrogen atom transfer. This method provides a powerful tool for site-selective glycan oxidation, offering significant potential for applications in carbohydrate chemistry and glycobiology.",

Spectroscopic evidence shows that the coupling reaction happens via initial reductive quenching of the Ir(III) catalyst under visible light.

Selective cleavage of thioketals requires the use of harsh conditions and reagents that limit the use of thioketals in chemoenzymatic synthesis. Herein, we describe a biocatalytic strategy for the cleavage of thioketals using enzymatic bromide recycling by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) enzymes. This reaction design involves halogenation-mediated thioketal cleavage through repetitive enzyme-mediated formation of hypobromous acid with a catalytic quantity of bromide salt and hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant. This protocol is demonstrated on a broad range of 1,3-dithiolanes in high yield and excellent chemoselectivity, performed on a gram scale, run with lysate and whole cells, and applied to the cleavage of 1,3-dithianes and 1,3-oxathiolanes.",

These intermediates exhibit nucleophilic character and undergo readily condensation reactions with aldehydes and ketones giving rise to target products. The mechanism of the latter reaction was studied by means of DFT calculations showing that activation of the carbonyl partner occurs through the formation of the hydrogen bond with the B(OH)2 group rather than through an interaction with the Lewis acid boron atom due to a plausible FLP-like behavior. The molecular structures of a few derivatives were determined by X-ray crystallography showing that in all cases, the molecules assemble through intermolecular BOH···O═P hydrogen bonds.",

The regioselective para-alkylation was conducted with unprotected anilines in a metal-free environment, while N-H alkylations were effectively performed under similarly mild conditions. DFT calculations were carried out to understand the distinctive chemoselectivity of N-alkylation and C-alkylation of unprotected arylamines with different nonpolar (toluene) and polar protic (HFIP) solvents.

The products of the deactivation were identified as diastereoisomeric phosphates (R,1R,2R)-3a and (R,1S,2S)-3b and are formed via an alkene bromophosphatation process where the phosphate of 1 behaves as a competitive nucleophile, as confirmed by authentic preparations of 3a and 3b from a stoichiometric bromophosphatation reaction. HPLC separation of the diastereoisomers gave pure 3a whose absolute and relative configurations were proven by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of phosphate 3a displayed four resonances despite 3a having just one phosphorus atom, and combined VT-NMR and DFT analysis revealed this to be a consequence of rotational isomerism about the 9-phenanthrene (Ar) bearing C3,3'-Ar bonds. Moreover, kinetic studies using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) of the catalytic cyclohexene bromoesterification showed first order kinetics in all reactants. The amount of phosphates 3a and 3b formed under catalytic bromoesterification conditions was quantified, enabling tracking of the temporal catalyst 1 concentration and hence elucidation of first order kinetics in catalyst 1. A catalytic cycle consistent with these observations is proposed.",

Nucleophile crossover experiments between the N-benzyl-1,3-diphenylallylamine product and 4-methoxybenzylamine mechanistically linked the changes in enantioselectivity to reformation of the η3-allylpalladium intermediate.

Analysis of percent crossover vs percent completion of the simultaneous reaction of 1-phenyl-3-methylallyl ethyl carbonate in the crossover experiment revealed that (1) the formation of the 1,3-diphenylallylpalladium intermediate frequently occurred before the reaction of 1-phenyl-3-methylallyl ethyl carbonate was complete, (2) the addition of DBU or Cs2CO3 suppressed formation of the 1,3-diphenylallylpalladium intermediate, and (3) the less polar toluene and THF solvents resulted in less or slower formation of the 1,3-diphenylallylpalladium intermediate than the more polar DCM and DMF solvents.",

For those substrates that provided mixtures of products, the incorporation of the triplet quenchers 2,3-dimethylbutadiene or Zn(OAc)2 demonstrated that the mixtures resulted from triplet excited states or mixtures of singlet and triplet excited states. Also demonstrated is that the reductive dearomatization of the dihydrobenzoquinolines gives the corresponding dehydropiperidine scaffold, as are present in members of the ergot alkaloid class of natural products.",

Key to this accomplishment is the highly diastereoselective synthesis of cis-fused bicyclic (3aS,6aS)- and (3aR,6aR)-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]pyrrol-2-one using Meyers’ tricyclic lactam methodology. The nucleophilic addition of trimethyl phosphite or dimethyl phenylphosphonite to chiral N-acyliminium ions affords the diastereoisomers, which are easily separated by column chromatography. The diastereoselectivity in the nucleophilic addition of the phosphorus reagents is completely consistent with our previous reports and all synthesized compounds were fully characterized.",

The latter method boasts a wider range of applicable substrates.

The commonly employed hydroboration-oxidation sequence for the synthesis of terminal alcohols is challenging for allylic alcohols, and O-protection of the alcohol can be necessary. To increase atom economy, we explored the use of silane protecting groups that can be engaged in intramolecular hydrosilylation. Oxidative cleavage of the cyclized product yields the desired 1,3-diol and obviates the need for super-stoichiometric borane reagents. Based on a detailed study of O-silylation conditions, a protocol is presented that furnishes quantitative yields of a wide range of O-silylated alcohols which contain Si–H bonds for further functionalization. We show that a MOF-based Rh(II) porphyrin can furnish efficient intramolecular hydrosilylation while the corresponding homogeneous analogue proved unreactive. Radical trapping studies suggest that silyl radicals constitute key intermediates in Rh(II) catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation. Preferential 5-endo-trig versus 6-exo-trig cyclization and 5-exo-trig versus 6-endo-trig cyclization of the silyl radical intermediates led to chemoselective 1,3-diol formation for substrates containing multiple olefins.",

This review discusses the synthesis of ferrocene compounds potentially relevant to electrochemical applications, focusing on recent strategies for nondirected C–H functionalization of the ferrocene core and diverse reactions for side-chain modifications. Advances in C–H activation of ferrocenes have been facilitated by catalytic methods utilizing Pd, Ir, Au, In, and Fe catalysts, as well as through photoredox and electrochemical techniques. Furthermore, side chains are modified via a range of mild transformations compatible with the ferrocene core, including substitution and annulation.

Here an improved kilogram scale synthesis of Abiraterone is presented, starting from commercially available dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by employing Quality by Design (QbD) principles, statistical design of experiments (DoE), and green metrics parameters to evaluate the environmental impact and efficiency. This article focuses on identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs), exploring the relationship between CQAs and material attributes (MAs), and determining the critical process parameters (CPPs) for synthesizing hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediates, and the final product, Abiraterone acetate. The presented approach effectively managed critical impurities and achieved impressive yields of 98, 84, and 78% with purity >99% in the hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediate, and final API, respectively. The improved synthesis was optimized and scaled for multi-kilogram batches, addressing challenges from previous methods and yielding ICH quality material in 65% overall yield.",

The initial discovery chemistry route required chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) at the end of the synthesis to provide enantiopure product. XtalFluor-E was used for deoxyfluorination on a ketone adjacent to a p-pyridylmethyl position, resulting in very low yields due to the elimination of HF. After several unsuccessful attempts for a de novo asymmetric synthesis, we focused our attention on the process development for a more practical synthesis than the existing route. A much higher yielding deoxyfluorination was enabled by SF4 and HF. Furthermore, the chiral SFC was replaced by an efficient classical resolution at a much earlier stage of the synthesis, taking advantage of the basicity of the pyridine moiety before oxidation to the pyridine N-oxide. Although not all stages have been scaled up in the plant scale, the new synthesis is much more practical and has improved the overall yield from 12% to 23% for this challenging molecule.",

Traditional synthetic processes typically employ sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution, which results in low product yields and generates large quantities of wastewater. In this study, calcium oxide is utilized as an alternative to sodium hydroxide, and the aldol condensation is carried out in anhydrous ethanol. Calcium oxide not only serves as a basic catalyst for the aldol condensation reaction but also reacts with the generated water to form calcium hydroxide, thereby removing water from the reaction system. This effectively shifts the equilibrium of the aldol condensation reaction, leading to a higher conversion rate of isovanillin and a significantly improved yield of 3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, reaching 85.2%. This study provides a novel and efficient green synthetic approach to 3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, offering significant potential for industrial applications.",

In this regard, one compound was around twofold more potent than kojic acid and was a competitive inhibitor for tyrosinase. In silico molecular modeling studies of the interactions of it and kojic acid with the active site of tyrosinase showed that this compound has more favorable binding energy than kojic acid.

One industrial application for HAT can be found in the tertiary benzylic C–H bond of cumene for producing phenol, a versatile chemical feedstock for various industries. However, the overall phenol yield remains low using the existing Hock process due to the poor selectivity towards the key reaction intermediate, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for phenol production through photooxidation of cumene to CHP using iron bromide under blue light irradiation, where bromine radicals (generated in situ via ligand-to-metal charge transfer) are used as hydrogen atom abstractors. Mechanistic studies revealed the cumene-to-CHP conversion occurred via a tertiary C–H bond abstraction by a radical mechanism, and the acetic acid and water additives increased CHP selectivity through stabilizing peroxides. The cumene-phenol process achieved up to 88% yield of CHP in 1 hour and could be used with a wide range of substrates. We thus developed a selective, mild, and efficient phenol production method using iron bromide under photooxidative conditions.",

However, the gaseous nature of these reagents, along with their intrinsic inertness due to their high bond-dissociation energies (99-105 kcal·mol-1), have rendered traditional strategies ineffective or lacking in selectivity. The use of flow chemistry technology, nonetheless, has made a tremendous impact in this field, improving the efficiency of multiphasic processes through improved mass transfer and larger interfacial areas. In this work, we report a new flow chemistry platform for the photocatalytic hydroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkenes with both isobutane and n-butane.

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of asymmetric THF α-O-arylation via Ni photochemical catalysis, leveraging enantioinduction data to refine the reaction pathway. Originally reported in a racemic fashion by Molander and Doyle, this transformation was re-examined using chiral bis(oxazoline) ligands, revealing distinct enantioselectivity trends depending on the halogen present in the aryl halide and Ni pre-catalyst. Stoichiometric experiments demonstrated that the Ni(II) oxidative addition complex is primarily responsible for trapping the THF radical, while multivariate linear regression modeling confirmed that the halide remains coordinated during the enantiodetermining step. Time-course experiments uncovered an alternative initial pathway when Ni(0) was used as the pre-catalyst, which ultimately converged to the main Ni(II) pathway. EPR analysis further revealed rapid comproportionation between Ni(0) and Ni(II), forming Ni(I) species that engage in radical trapping at early stages, accounting for the observed reactivity differences. By integrating enantioselectivity data with experimental techniques such as EPR spectroscopy, this study establishes enantioinduction analysis as a powerful tool for mechanistic investigations in Ni photochemical catalysis. The insights gained not only refine our understanding of this transformation, but also provide a framework for probing similar Ni/Ir dual photocatalytic systems.1 \tIntroduction2 \tEnantioselectivity Data Highlights a Complex Mechanistic Scenario3 \tProbing the Predominant Pathway with Stoichiometric Experiments4 \tMLR Modeling to Understand the Halogen Effect on the Enantioinduction5 \tProposed Prevalent Mechanism6 \tInitiation with Ni(0) Precatalyst7 \tConclusion",

    "abstract": "Since its discovery, the isatin scaffold has been recognized for its significance, but it gained particular attention after being isolated from natural sources and identified as a natural product. This discovery prompted extensive research into its synthesis, as well as its chemical and biological applications. The isatin scaffold undergoes several key chemical reactions, including oxidation, reduction, ring expansion, Friedel-Crafts reactions, and aldol condensation, resulting in the formation of biologically active compounds such as 2-oxindoles, tryptanthrin, indirubins, and others. In recent years, numerous derivatives of isatin, particularly those involving N-, C3-, and C5-positions, have been synthesized and investigated for their diverse biological activities, with some even receiving FDA approval as therapeutic agents. This account provides a concise overview of the isatin scaffold, highlighting its synthesis, reactivity, and structural features of the scaffold as well as those of its main derivatives, particularly their ability to engage in various non-covalent interactions. Finally, selected recent biological applications of isatin derivatives are discussed, with an emphasis on contributions from our own research group. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the isatin scaffold's potential as a platform for designing potent bioactive molecules, with an optimistic outlook on its future in drug development.",

Molecular docking studies on the mTOR protein (PDB ID: 4JT6) revealed strong binding affinities, with key interactions at active site residues. MD simulations in GROMACS (50 ns) confirmed the stability of compound-protein complexes. In vitro cytotoxicity assays against A549, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines showed potent activity, with UC-RS-04 displaying an IC50 of 0.027 µM in lung cancer, outperforming standard drugs like 5-Fluorouracil (0.28 µM) and Everolimus (0.09 µM). Toxicity studies on VERO cells confirmed selectivity, sparing normal cells.

Organocatalysis is an exciting field in chemistry that utilizes small organic molecules as catalysts to accelerate chemical reactions under sub-stoichiometric conditions. These catalysts offer advantages like environmentally friendly conditions, high selectivity, and efficiency for synthesizing complex molecules. In the last few years, organocatalyzed glycosylation has significantly progressed in carbohydrate chemistry particular to the stereoselective synthesis of oligosaccharides.

    "abstract": "Organic radicals with light-emitting properties and exceptional stability offer exciting opportunities to address spin-statistical limitations in organic electronics and advance quantum technologies. These radicals, acting as small molecular magnets, exhibit sensitivity to minute magnetic fields and can be tailored with diverse spin centers, making them ideal for spin-optical interfaces, representing key components in quantum communication systems. Furthermore, their ability to form organized, higher-dimensional assemblies presents a promising avenue for overcoming scalability challenges in quantum technologies. Despite their potential, achieving high luminescence quantum yields has largely been limited to donor-functionalized monoradicals, and a detailed understanding of the luminescent behavior of open-shell organic molecules remains elusive. This review delves into the photoluminescent properties and spin ground states of trityl-based mono-, di-, and multiradicals, examining the strategies employed to enhance their performance. Additionally, we review predictive methods for determining the luminescence and spin states of radicals, highlighting critical unresolved questions that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of trityl-based radicals in advanced technological applications.",

We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance. We suggest first steps that researchers can take to move towards a positive culture of data sharing in organic chemistry. Routine actions that we encourage as standard practice include deposition of raw and metadata to open repositories, and inclusion of machine-readable structure identifiers for all reported compounds.",

Remarkably, Cs3PO4 exhibits the highest extraction efficiency, driven by strong cooperative interactions involving ion-dipole coordination between Cs+ and carbonyl (C=O) groups, as well as direct ion-pairing interactions between 18-crown-6-complexed Cs+ and hexaurea-bound PO43−.

In this article, we report the synthesis of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,3-diones via a reversible transimination reaction between Schiff’ base (C=N) linkage-containing pyrrolidine-2,3-dione derivatives and methylamine with yields of 80 to 92%. In addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-diphenylpyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5a) was also verified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized molecules were evaluated for compliance with established drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, Egan, and Muegge), as well as ADMET properties. All compounds satisfied these criteria, indicating favorable oral bioavailability. Molecular docking analysis showed that compounds 5a–e act as ligands for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), especially with Cys200 and Ser242 via hydrogen bonds. In addition, van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the ligand–iNOS complexes. In particular, 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-5-phenyl-1-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5e) exhibited the strongest binding affinity (−9.51 kcal/mol) and demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production, with an IC50 value of 43.69 ± 5.26 µM. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (-NO2 group) on the benzene ring at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine-2,3-dione subunit in compound 5e may be responsible for the observed high inhibition activity due to the enhancement and optimization of hydrogen bonding with Cys200. These results underscore the potential of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidenepyrrolidine-2,3-diones, especially compound 5e, as promising scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting iNOS-related pathologies.",

We studied the potential conversion of norbornadiene to quadricyclane (QC) isomers. As main investigation tools, UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy were utilized. We determined significant spectral features of the formed NBD species, including λmax and λonset values, all of which exhibit redshifts compared to their isocyclic counterparts.

A full catalytic cycle for the enantioselective synthesis of α-hydrazinonitriles is proposed based on insights gained from DFT calculations. Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) has been used as a sacrificial cyanide source. We found that isocyanide (rather than cyanide) is a preferred coordination to calcium during the catalytic cycle, while the active catalyst prefers a side-on coordination of cyanide. The configuration-determining step is a hydrocyanation via a calcium isocyanide complex, whereas the rate-limiting step is that which recovers the calcium catalyst and replaces the TMS-bound product from the catalyst. While our experimental data demonstrate enantioselectivity values as high as 89% under certain conditions, the overall enantioselectivity achieved with the calcium catalyst remains modest, mainly due to competing pathways for the Z- and E-hydrazone isomers leading to opposite enantiomers. The experimental results confirm these computational proposals.",

A recently introduced orthogonally photoswitchable heterobivalent azobenzene Glc/Man glycocluster was utilized to examine these aspects of carbohydrate recognition in a bacterial adhesion–inhibition assay. The measured results were systematically contextualized employing new reference compounds such as the respective homobivalent Man/Man glycocluster. An in-depth study comprising the analysis of the photochromic properties and the potential as inhibitors of bacterial adhesion of the synthetic glycophotoswitches in their different isomeric states led to new insights into the role of ligand orientation in carbohydrate recognition.

Herein, the first two‐step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase‐catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16 h using eco‐friendly t‐amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4 h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.",

Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium‐containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena‐hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO‐LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia‐analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) and thiaradialene (1.58 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low‐lying LUMO energy levels.",

The use of cage‐shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction.

Recent studies show that deuteration can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of drug molecules, thereby enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. As a result, deuteration is being increasingly integrated into pharmaceutical development. At the same time, introducing deuterium into organic electronic materials helps to reduce high‐frequency molecular vibrations, thus broadening the range of applications of organic materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic components.\nSince the approval of the deuterated drug deutetrabenazine in 2017 and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light‐emitting diodes, multideuteration technologies have advanced considerably. Various strategies utilizing both rare and earth‐abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration have been reported. This review examines recently developed metal catalysts for multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges in deuteration methods, and explores future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.",

A DFT‐based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40 kcal·mol‐1, and in the triplet state, 1.47 kcal·mol‐1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is 589 times faster than in the ground state.",

The computed mechanistic pathways correspond to the experimental observations and explain why the oxoalkyl tryptamide derivative selectively reacts in a Robinson–Gabriel cyclization (highest activation Gibbs free energy is 194.9 kJ mol−1) and does not give any Bischler–Napieralski product (highest activation Gibbs free energy of the pathway is 269.4 kJ mol−1).

However, the methodology available for the preparation of open‐cage fullerenes remains limited. Herein, it is discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps is initiated, resulting in the one‐step synthesis of the corresponding open‐cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology is confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open‐cage fullerenes and is expected to promote the widespread application of open‐cage fullerene derivatives.",

    "abstract": "In the last 20 years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem, it is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work. The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available d‐mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A density functional theory (DFT) theoretical study is carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer‐like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal‐like functional group at C‐1. All compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.",

Herein, the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4‐addition to challenging 4‐quinolones is reported, upon in situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal‐catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion‐binding catalysis using a chiral triazole‐based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2‐substituted 2,3‐dihydro‐4‐quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4‐amino and γ–amino alcohol derivatives by post‐functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (>99:1 e.r.), was showcased. The notable features of this protocol include its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance, and potential application toward the synthesis of chiral 2,3‐dihydro‐4‐quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.",

The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late‐stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.",

Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single‐carbon‐atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five‐membered carbon‐ and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six‐membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven‐membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo‐ and electro‐catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single‐carbon‐atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology.",

Notably, this sustainable and straightforward protocol selectively introduces the Bpin group at the sterically hindered α‐carbon of the naphthalene framework, complementing C–H borylations of the naphthalene core, that preferentially occur at the β‐position.

In this review, we summarize the coupling reactions of three types of α,β‐unsaturated ketoximes with various organic compounds containing unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles and so on over the past decades. The reaction conditions, selected examples of the reaction scope, limitations, and reasonable mechanisms are critically described.

The protocol takes place upon irradiation of the reaction mixture in the presence of the decatungstate anion, which triggers C−H cleavage in the chosen aliphatic substrates. The photogenerated C‐centered radicals add regioselectively to the central C(sp)‐atom of the cumulenic structure, delivering an allyl‐type radical adduct that finally leads to the β‐substituted alkenoate ester of interest. When an aliphatic allenoate is adopted, the protocol leads to the selective formation of a β,γ‐alkenoate, while the corresponding phenyl ester delivers a mixture of β,γ‐ and α,β‐alkenoates. Rationalization of the observed regioselectivity is supported by computational work, which highlights how the steric demand of the allenoate ester at the radical adduct level determines the reaction outcome. The versatility of the protocol, which can also take place under (telescoped) flow conditions, is further demonstrated by the possibility to divert the reaction outcome toward the selective formation of β,γ‐ or α,β‐alkenoate esters by performing the photocatalyzed process alone or in combination with a subsequent base‐promoted C=C double bond migration, respectively.",

The catalyst exhibited a high selectivity and activity, achieving up to a 97% yield of cyclic carbonates at atmospheric CO2 pressure and 70 °C. The simulated post‐combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used as the material for the reaction to yield 90% of styrene carbonate from styrene oxide. Furthermore, the catalyst was easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles without any significant loss of activity. This study provides a practical and environmentally‐friendly approach for CO2 utilization, contributing to the advancement of sustainable catalytic processes.",

At ambient pressure and mild temperatures, Pd@POP‐1 effectively converts low‐concentration CO2 (less than 15 vol.%) into quinazolinones, even in the presence of SO2 (up to 428 mg/m3) and NO2 (up to 221 mg/m3), achieving high yields. Remarkably, Pd@POP‐1 also efficiently transforms CO2 from boiler flue gas, which contains 10 vol.% CO2, into quinazolinones with satisfactory yields. This approach not only provides an eco‐friendly alternative for quinazolinone production by replacing phosgene with actual flue gas as a carbon source but also represents a promising strategy for the resource utilization of CO2 in flue gas.",

Herein, we report a one‐pot, two‐step sequential deracemization of racemic sec‐alcohols to optically enriched primary amines throught a photo‐biocatalytic oxidation‐reductive amination linear cascade. In the first step, near‐to‐quantitative oxidation of a set of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols into prochiral ketones was accomplished using visible light photoredox catalysis relying on 440 nm blue LEDs irradiation, 9‐fluorenone as a transition‐metal‐free photocatalyst, and O2‐saturated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the reaction medium and a quencher of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The intermediary ketones were further converted into the corresponding non‐racemic amines with up to 99% conversion, high‐to‐excellent optical purity (90–99.9% ee), and complementary absolute configuration via a stereoselective reductive amination catalyzed by lyophilized E. coli cells containing the respective (R)‐ or (S)‐selective recombinant transaminases (E. coli/TAs) in an aqueous KPi buffer in the presence of pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate (PLP) as cofactor and isopropylamine (iPrNH2) as an amino group donor. The developed photo‐biocatalytic system was scaled up for racemic 1‐phenylethanol (1.0 mmol), furnishing (S)‐(−)‐1‐phenylethylamine with 91% conv., 82% isolated yield and 99% ee. An exemplary functionalization of the obtained (S)‐α‐methylbenzylamine with 6‐chloro‐3‐isopropylpyrimidine‐2,4(1H,3H)‐dione led to afford an enantiomerically enriched newly launched cardiac‐specific myosin inhibitor mavacamten in 76% yield and 99% ee.

Additionally, a straightforward and scalable protocol for synthesis of 4‐trifluoromethylpyrrole‐3‐carboxamide derivatives without K2CO3, utilizing diverse 1,3‐dicarbonyl compounds has been established.

Theoretical analyses are complemented with experimental titration and kinetic techniques to verify the intrinsic details of the reaction. This study reveals an intricate hydrogen bond network formed in the rate‐ and selectivity‐determining step, involving four noncovalently attached components that favor a stronger substrate⋅⋅⋅catalyst interaction in the R transition state.

The complexes fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3Br] are obtained from the reaction of Mn(CO)5Br with the bidentate ligand PN = R2N(CH2)2PR'2, where R = Me, Et, and pyrrolidine and R' = Ph, iPr, and Cy. Treatment of fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3Br] with AgOTf yields fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3OTf]. Upon reaction of fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3OTf] with MeLi (R' = alkyl) or MeMgCl (R' = aryl), fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3Me] is formed. fac-[Mn(PCyNMe)(CO)3Me] and fac-[Mn(PPhNMe)(CO)3Me] are identified as the best catalysts for the dimerization of phenylacetylene and the hydroboration of 4-chlorostyrene, respectively.",

A subsequent one-electron reduction of 2 yielded the dicoordinate borylene (Me2-cAAC)BSi(SiMe3)3, 3, which rapidly underwent intramolecular C-H activation to give cyclo-(Me2-cAAC)B(H)Si(SiMe3)3, 4, irrespective of the employed reaction conditions. Compound 3 could be stabilized as the carbonyl complex (Me2-cAAC)B(CO)Si(SiMe3)3, 5, that gave 4 upon irradiation with a UV light under a CO2 atmosphere. In contrast, the two-electron reduction of 1 under an atmosphere of CO2 yielded a mixture of products of which (Me2-cAAC)B(Cl)(H)C(O)OSi(SiMe3)3, 6, could be separated and structurally characterized. Compound 6 is a rare example of CO2 insertion into a B-E (E = heavier main group element) bond in which boron functions as a nucleophile, thereby mimicking transition metal-mediated carboxylation. The mechanism for the formation of 6 from the purported boryl anion intermediate [(Me2-cAAC)B(Cl)Si(SiMe3)3]-, 2 -, was analyzed computationally.",

    "abstract": "The rate, site-selectivity, and product isomerization of the C(sp2)–H oxidative addition of arenes with pyridine(dicarbene) cobalt methyl and phenyl complexes have been investigated with four representative arenes of varying electronic and steric properties. The rates of C(sp2)–H activation to yield cobalt-aryl products and subsequent aryl isomerization were influenced by the electronic properties of the arene; the relatively electron-poor arene 3-fluorobenzotrifluoride underwent C(sp2)–H activation and isomerization of the cobalt-aryl more than 70 times faster than the more electron-rich substrate, 3-fluoro-N,N,α-trimethylbenzeneacetamide. In all cases, meta-to-fluorine C(sp2)–H oxidative addition was the major product at low conversion, which subsequently isomerized to the ortho isomer over time. Deuterium-labeling experiments and measurement of methane isotopologues establish that the major cobalt-aryl product at early conversion arises from kinetically preferred, meta-selective oxidative addition. Density functional theory calculations support pathways involving cobalt(I)–(III) redox cycles with oxidative addition to cobalt(I) occurring with a relatively high barrier followed by faster reductive elimination. Despite the strong σ-donating properties of the pyridine(dicarbene) pincer ligand, the π-accepting character of the carbene donors lowers the barrier for reductive elimination, and hence, cobalt(III) intermediates have not been observed.",

Among them, an octahydroindole-based peptidomimetic covalent inhibitor 28f showed strong inhibitory activity against Mpros and exhibited broad-spectrum anticoronavirus activity with EC50 values ranging from 0.027 to 4.41 μM. Besides, this compound displayed potent antiviral activity against EV71. Compared to FB2001, 28f displayed better pharmacokinetic properties, and the value of oral bioavailability in CD-1 mice and Beagle dogs was improved to 10.4 and 10.2%, respectively. In addition, oral treatment with 28f could significantly reduce the viral loads of HCoV-OC43 in mice, and compound 28f could also effectively reduce lung viral loads in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model without ritonavir. Taken together, compound 28f is a promising orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate that deserves further research.",

While α-position disulfide bonds are advantageous for rapid response to redox conditions, they also risk premature drug leakage during circulation. This study introduces a steric hindrance-guided approach to engineer disulfide-bridged podophyllotoxin homodimeric prodrugs for spatiotemporal controlled delivery. By monomethyl or dimethyl substitution of the carbon atoms adjacent to the α-disulfide bond, we can modulate steric hindrance. Excessive hindrance destabilizes the nanoassemblies and slows effective drug release, while moderate hindrance (monomethyl modification) enhances pharmacokinetic properties and promotes selective tumor activation. In vivo studies indicate that monomethyl-modified prodrug nanoassemblies exhibit superior antitumor efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity compared to PPT solution. This work underscores the importance of steric hindrance in optimizing prodrug nanoassembly stability and tumor-specific activation, offering a comprehensive strategy for redox-responsive nanomedicines.",

RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute the largest class of ubiquitin enzymes, providing a scaffold for substrate recognition and catalysis. Their shallow groove recognition interfaces involving discontinuous epitopes and a lack of defined binding pockets have largely rendered them undruggable. Inspired by natural RING inhibitors, we have developed a pharmacophore-based strategy for the rational design of peptidomimetics targeting RING domains, and we demonstrate its feasibility by using the macromolecular APC/C complex (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome). We designed scaffolds binding to the APC/C RING domain and efficiently inhibiting its activity in vitro. Iterative structure-based design and experimental studies to optimize their chemical stability, permeability, and specificity lead to new hydrocarbon-stapled-based molecules inhibiting APC/C in vitro and in cancer cells. Our results provide a robust rationale for targeting RING-containing enzymes of therapeutic value and promising leads for clinical APC/C inhibition.",

However, the reasons for this pharmacokinetic behavior are less explored. Herein, we focused on identifying potential mechanisms for our previously developed heterobivalent (SST2/albumin) [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-cLAB-TATEs. For this purpose, we designed two novel derivatives that show either negligible binding to albumin or lack the SST2-targeting capability. Based on the in vivo results, we hypothesize that binding of the albumin-bound radioligand to SST2 in addition to that of the free radioligand causes the increased tumor uptake. This is supported by saturation binding analyses in the presence of albumin and compartment modeling considerations. Overall, the results of this study provide a first tentative explanation for the phenomenon of increased tumor uptake for albumin-binding radioligands, which may support the prospective design of such radioligands.",

Notably, hexahydroazepino[3,4-b]indole derivative D2 exhibited favorable oral bioavailability (F = 47.13%) and potent antifungal activity both in vitro and in vivo, making it a promising oral antifungal candidate for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. Furthermore, we employed affinity-based protein profiling to identify the potential targets of the carboline derivatives. Proteomic analysis of a photoaffinity probe revealed that the SET domain-containing protein was the potential target.

While small-molecule soaking can advance inhibitor development, the selectivity pocket is absent in available Sirt2 apo structures, and existing soaking systems like Sirt2-ADPribose (ADPR) suffer from unfavorable crystal packing that hinders ligand binding. We developed a method to rapidly generate high-quality Sirt2 apo crystals with an open selectivity pocket, suitable for high-throughput soaking. The induced-fit pocket forms upon seeding with a Sirtuin Rearranging ligand (SirReal) and is retained in the ligand-free apo structure. Screening the Maybridge Ro3-fragment library using a fluorescence polarization assay yielded three novel Sirt2-fragment-inhibitor structures. Additionally, our Sirt2 apo crystals can accommodate ligands at the acyl-lysine channel entrance and the cofactor binding site, as confirmed by binding of the peptide inhibitor KT9 and NAD+, facilitating SAR studies and inhibitor optimization.",

Herein, we designed a small-molecule STING inhibitor and STING mutant-specific degrader by binding two coupled pockets of a STING dimer. Structure optimization selected SI-24, SI-42, and SI-43 with low nanomolar activity to inhibit 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-induced STING activation and release of IFN-β and CXCL-10, which were far more potent than reported STING inhibitors. Moreover, the three lead compounds suppressed cGAMP-induced oligomerization of STING and phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and STING. Surprisingly, SI-43 promoted mutant-specific and proteasome-independent degradation of STINGS154 and STINGM155. Subcutaneous or oral administration of SI-24, SI-42, and SI-43 reduced serum IFN-β and CXCL-10 in the cGAMP-induced autoimmune disease mouse model. Our dual-functional compounds provide a new strategy to investigate STING function through both inhibition and mutant-specific degradation in autoimmune diseases.",

Molecular docking analysis, CETSA, and BLI confirmed its strong HDAC6 binding. Moreover, 38k displayed robust in vitro and in vivo antiesophageal cancer efficacy, along with an advantageous pharmacokinetic and safety profile. Notably, combining 38k with a PI3K inhibitor synergistically enhanced the efficacy (75.02% tumor growth inhibition vs 50.94% monotherapy), likely by counteracting HDAC6 inhibition-induced PI3K/AKT activation. These findings validate HDAC6 as a therapeutic target and highlight 38k as a promising candidate for esophageal cancer treatment, particularly in combination regimens.",

This compound predominantly triggered ferroptosis, along with apoptosis as a complementary mechanism, unveiling a new pathway for the anticancer effects of synthetic anion transporters. Furthermore, compound 6 demonstrated potent antitumor activity against HeLa xenografts with minimal side effects and might find high potentials in the field of cancer chemotherapy.",

In this context, this work focuses on optimizing diarylsulfide hits previously identified as EBOV entry inhibitors. Structural modifications resulted in diarylamine derivatives, with confirmed antiviral activity against replicative EBOV and significantly improved metabolic stability compared to diarylsulfides. Using different techniques, the EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) was identified as the target of these compounds. Residue Y517GP2 is critical for biological activity, while T519GP2, E100GP1, and D522GP2 also contribute to ligand binding. Furthermore, the binding of the derivatives to EBOV-GP has been shown to destabilize the complex with the virus receptor NPC1. In short, a new family of diarylsulfides and diarylamines with antiviral activity against EBOV has been developed, and their mechanism of action has been deciphered, paving the way for future pharmaceutical development.",

Ru3, a metal-based photosensitizer, features a high positive charge, a long triplet excited-state lifetime, and an excellent PDT activity. The aptamer AS1411, known for its ability to selectively bind to nucleolin (which is overexpressed in tumor cells), self-assembled with Ru3 into nanoparticles termed Ru3ApNPs. These nanoparticles specifically target SiHa tumor cells. Upon light irradiation, Ru3ApNPs increase intracellular ROS levels, catalyze NADH redox reactions, and induce lysosomal disruption, ultimately triggering pyroptosis in tumor cells. Notably, Ru3ApNPs demonstrate excellent tumor penetration in 3D multicellular spheroids (MCSs) of SiHa cells and effectively inhibit their growth under light exposure. Ru3ApNPs exhibit a mechanism of action distinct from that of traditional PDT. Furthermore, under light irradiation, Ru3ApNPs can effectively inhibit the growth of distant tumors and induce systemic immune responses in mice. Our data suggest that Ru3ApNPs can be developed as promising targeted therapeutic agents in the future.",

However, the rapid crystallization of Sn‐Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual‐anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high‐quality MA‐free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent‐free spin‐coating process. Acetate anions (Ac−) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac− and thiocyanate anions (SCN−) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual‐anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non‐radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single‐junction Sn‐Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn‐Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all‐perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p‐MPSCs) enables rapid and selective extraction of photogenerated electrons and facilitates device fabrication without a hole transport layer (HTL). However, the inherent mesoporous architecture introduces abundant interfacial defects that promote undesired non‐radiative recombination, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). To address this challenge, an interface field‐effect passivation strategy is implemented, leveraging spatially selective cation extrusion. By incorporating tetraphenylphosphonium cations, sterically bulky organic ions that migrate to the perovskite/ETL interface during crystallization, a robust interfacial electrostatic field is introduced. This field simultaneously suppresses the non‐radiative recombination by inducing field‐effect passivation and enhances the charge extraction through optimizing energy alignment. The synergistic effects yield a PCE enhancement from 19.4% to 21.0%. This work underscores the potential of cation‐engineered interfacial fields to improve the performance of HTL‐free carbon‐electrode perovskite photovoltaics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLong blood circulation and fast cellular uptake are essential yet paradoxical requirements for efficient tumor‐targeted drug delivery carriers. For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long‐circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein‐resistant yet cell membrane‐binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell‐membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N‐alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N‐alkyl chain became cell membrane‐philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)‐loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple‐negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor‐active drug delivery carriers.",

However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (>100 mA cm−2) remains a significant challenge. Here, near‐infrared (≈797 nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of ≈24.7% and EQEs of >20% across a wide range of current densities (70–1200 mA cm−2), resulting in an ultra‐high peak radiance of 2270 W sr−1 m−2. These PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability with operational lifetimes (T50) of 6.6, 12.7, 19.2, 49.5, 238.6, and 350 h at current densities of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50 mA cm−2, respectively.

Here, elemental iodine (I2) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine‐rich condition and to transform into I− ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well‐crystallized perovskite with vertically‐aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep‐red (678 nm) and pure‐red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and  transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon‐conducting ceramics offer a low‐density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4 W m−1 K−1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi‐generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low‐loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m−1 K−1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post‐processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly‐lactic acid  matrix from surface‐modified boron nitride platelets, creating a “hetero‐percolated network”. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.",

Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono‐disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra‐dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room‐temperature structural transformation‐induced in situ core‐shell self‐assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre‐core‐shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit >80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential >80 mV) even after >10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single‐photon emission with g(2)(0) M is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon‐based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium‐ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide‐based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double‐layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of π‐conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub‐graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon‐like large π‐conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen‐free edge C(sp2)–H sites, and well‐defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g−1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g−1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid‐state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)‐vacancies (O‐LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐based CPEs (PEO@O‐LZO). The O‐LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O‐vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O‐vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O‐LZO at 40 °C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O‐LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40 °C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency.

With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off‐target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic‐based Calibrated 5‐ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non‐pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5‐ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia‐inducible promoter regulating O‐acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post‐treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor‐specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5‐ALA‐based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor‐targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.",

However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell‐proliferation‐related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7‐targeting chimera (AP‐CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein‐targeting aptamer with a mutant‐CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4.

Moreover, the AP‐CRTAC constructed with a 2′ F‐pyrimidine‐modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP‐CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR‐targeted therapies, to the third‐generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid–liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high‐energy‐density flexible lithium‐ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid‐phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid‐phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer.

The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of >99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high‐voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm−2, high volumetric energy density of 500 Wh L−1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0 mm.

This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro‐level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular‐oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state‐of‐the‐art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the “oxidant‐catalyst‐pollutants” internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC‐AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting‐edge laboratory devices and pilot‐scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs‐AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided.

    "abstract": "AbstractSolar‐driven one‐step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber‐Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra‐low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co‐synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO‐Fe), enabling the formation spatially‐separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d‐electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO‐Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo‐photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi‐directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but existing photocatalysts often suffer from modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co‐activation, such as Mg‐activated water or non‐sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon‐nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox‐flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.",

Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN‐F, phCN‐Cl, 2phCN‐F, and 2phCN‐Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN‐F‐based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN‐F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85°C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record‐breaking SMAs.",

Here, a novel strategy is proposed—an inorganic polymer hydrogel, prepared by crosslinking long‐chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+), which effectively address the rigidity and fragility issues commonly associated with traditional inorganic gels. With the most stable hydration shell among those ions, Ni2+ tends to interact indirectly with LPP through hydrogen bonds rather than coordination bonds. The unique Ni2+‐phosphate interaction endows the Ni‐LPP hydrogels with ultrahigh elongation at break (≈15 000×). Further experiments reveal that the Ni2+‐phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor. The highly extensible, good conductive (1.06 ± 0.08 S m−1), self‐healing (within 30 s and without stimulation), arbitrarily shapeable, and nonflammable Ni‐LPP inorganic hydrogel indicates a bright future in flexible electronics, environmental remediation, and beyond.",

Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity‐related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light‐responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual‐targeting and multiple‐signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1‐like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low‐grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs‐mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long‐term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light‐sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems.",

However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order–disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25 V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order–disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li‐rich cathode materials through a dedicated order–disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage.",

However, most multifunctional hydrogel sensors are prone to water loss and become useless e‐waste, resulting in a growing threat to the global environment and human health. Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self‐healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200 ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real‐time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R‐TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote‐controlling platforms, paving the way for large‐scale, multi‐scenario applications.",

However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four‐electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy‐saving H₂ production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high‐value‐added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure–performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research.",

Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface‐stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image‐guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin‐conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR ∼ 2), while enabling prolonged 3‐day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation.

Here, sonicated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate are demonstrated, enabling selective contaminant degradation via dual nonradical pathways—singlet oxygen oxidation and direct electron transfer. Optimized sonication introduces catalytically active carbonyl (C═O) groups on CNT surfaces while preserving their graphitic structure, ensuring rapid electron transfer.

Furthermore, scalable CNT catalyst synthesis and integration into flat membrane and hollow fiber filtration devices, ensuring long‐term stability and efficient pollutant removal in natural river water, are demonstrated.

These structures are correlated with their electronic bandgaps, ranging from 2.2 to 2.5 eV, using ultra‐low‐loss electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy for individual nanowires in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Notably, the variation in bandgaps diverges from that of bulk selenium and is non‐monotonic on the host‐nanotube diameter, indicating that conformational distortions in selenium chains begin counteracting quantum confinement effects at sub‐nm scales. A 1D phase diagram predicting selenium's atomic structure based on nanotube diameter, regardless of the chemistry of the host nanotube is developed, which can be BNNT or carbon nanotubes. Phase changes in selenium nanowires are imaged in real‐time by transmission electron microscopy using BNNT as a test tube with an adjustable diameter.

Traditional strategies cannot provide bionic electrical output, thereby failing to sufficiently activate the “mechano‐electro‐biochemical” cascade effect in situ and limiting the repair efficiency of CSBDs. Here, a bionic, self‐adhesive, and biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) called PPCs‐TENG using silk‐fibroin‐derived peptide (Cs)‐grafted polydopamine–polyacrylamide (PPCs) as the electrode layer is fabricated. It provides bionic electrical stimulation (bio‐ES) in response to the host's motion status. It reestablishes the resting potential during host rest and generates real‐time biofeedback action potential during host movement. Further, it activates the “mechano‐electro‐biochemical” cascade effect for accelerating the repair of CSBDs. The bio‐ES generated from PPCs‐TENG enriches extracellular osteogenesis‐related biochemical factors at the CSBD site. It also activates the intracellular mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, thereby promoting calcium signaling and intracellular mechano‐transduction pathways. This activation enhances the proliferation and migration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs. In vivo tests demonstrate that PPCs‐TENG significantly accelerates the repair of CSBDs in situ.",

    "abstract": "AbstractArtificial tactile perception systems that emulate the functions of slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors are essential for developing advanced prosthetics and humanoid robots. However, constructing a high‐performance sensory system within a single device capable of simultaneously perceiving both static and dynamic forces for surface‐texture recognition remains a critical challenge; this contrasts with common strategies integrating individual SA‐ and FA‐mimicking sensors in multi‐layered, multi‐circuit configurations. Herein, a textile pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is reported based solely on piezoresistive principle alongside high sensitivity and rapid response to both high‐frequency vibrations and static forces. These characteristics are attributed to the sensor's 3D multiscale architecture and the corresponding hierarchical structural deformation of its honeycomb‐like sensing fabric. As a proof‐of‐concept application relevant to humanoid robotics and prosthetics, an automated surface‐texture‐recognition system is constructed by integrating the PT sensor with machine‐learning algorithms, a prosthetic device, an industrial robot arm, and a graphical user interface. This artificial sensory system demonstrates the ability to learn distinct object features, differentiate fine surface textures, and subsequently classify unknown textiles with high recognition accuracy (>98.9%) across a wide range of scanning speeds (50–300 mm s−1). These results show promise for the future development of interactive artificial intelligence.",

To address these, biomimetic bacterial outer membrane nanoparticles (BM‐NPs) are designed by integrating the precise targeting capability of detoxified outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) with the efficient drug‐loading properties of liposomes. BM‐NPs exhibit superior targeting efficiency toward peripheral neutrophils and macrophages, enabling spatiotemporal drug delivery via immune cells. An innovative “Tortoise and Hare” dynamic adaptive delivery strategy is introduced, where neutrophils facilitate rapid drug transport during the acute phase of SCI, while macrophages ensure sustained delivery during the subacute phase. This strategy aligns with the dynamic pathological progression of SCI, offering precision targeting tailored to different stages of injury. BM‐NPs demonstrate multifaceted therapeutic effects, including the suppression of foam cell formation through coordinated enhancement of lipid droplet autophagy and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, they modulate the inflammatory microenvironment, preserve myelin integrity, and significantly promote neural functional recovery post‐SCI. By overcoming the limitations of conventional delivery systems in targeting and timeliness, BM‐NPs offer an innovative, highly efficient, and clinically translatable platform for SCI treatment and other acute inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system.",

The design of hierarchical architectures within synthetic hydrogels to concurrently achieve mechanical reinforcement and functional integration remains challenging. Here, a biomimetic hierarchical engineering approach is reported to develop mechanically robust and function‐customizable supramolecular hydrogels by utilizing strong yet dynamic fibrous nanoarchitectures of amphiphilic peptides as crosslinkers. This design, on one hand, resolves the strength‐toughness trade‐off in hydrogel design through energy‐dissipative mechanisms involving dynamic detachment and reinsertion of peptides within their assembled nanostructures upon loading. On the other hand, the amphiphilicity and sequence programmability of peptides allow spatially orthogonal integration of multiple dynamic functionalities across distinct structural domains, including lipophilic fluorophore encapsulation, photopatterning capability, and anisotropic contraction. Capitalizing on its ultralow hysteresis and rapid recovery properties, the hydrogel's effectiveness is demonstrated as high‐sensitivity strain sensors. Moreover, the fully noncovalent crosslinking strategy permits closed‐loop recycling and reprocessing via reversible crosslinker disassembly‐reassembly processes. Through systematic extension of this principle across diverse peptide systems, a generalized platform is demonstrated for creating advanced soft materials that synergistically integrate traditionally incompatible attributes of mechanical robustness, customable dynamic functionality, and environmental sustainability.",

This system allows automatic and intelligent concealment of targets in complex and dynamic thermal environments without human intervention. The self‐adaptive IR camouflage is facilitated by the manipulation of the metamaterial's tilt angle for continuous tunability of emissivity, which is attributed to the tilt angle‐dependent broadband impedance matching mechanisms. Equipped with programmable feedback algorithm commands, the integrated system dynamically adapts to varying thermal backgrounds, achieving apparent temperature modulation of up to 27 °C (ranging from 14 to 41 °C) while minimizing thermal imaging contrast to within 1 °C.

In this work, a novel ligand field‐induced dual active sites mechanism is introduced by incorporating Ni into the PBA framework, activating Ni as an additional redox center for NH4+ ion storage.

Advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations confirm the activation of Ni and the enhanced interaction between NH4+ ions and the framework.

To expedite drug development in PM, hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel‐supported PM patient‐derived tumor explants (PDTE) that better preserve histological features, composition, and biological pathways of the original tumor, as compared to conventional PDTE culture methods are developed. Hydrogel modulation shows that stiffness, degradation, three‐dimensional embedding, and HA itself are key parameters that enhance PDTE maintenance ex vivo. Further, HA hydrogels effectively preserve PDTE viability by disrupting myosin II‐mediated tissue contraction, a phenomenon that occurs in the absence of hydrogel embedding. Lastly, the addition of ascites into PM PDTE not only recapitulates changes to the tumor microenvironment as observed in patients but also ascites‐dependent drug efficacy, highlighting the importance of incorporating ascites into ex vivo PM models for accurate therapeutic evaluation. The bioengineered PM PDTE models in this study serve as a valuable platform for drug development and treatment personalization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWhile metal doping strategies have proven effective in regulating the bandgap and enhancing the photophysical properties of hybrid metal halides, site‐specific atom alloying by mixing metals of different elements offers a new route for material modification. Here an antimony halide hybrid material with the formula of (C₄H₁₂N₂)₅[(SbCl₅)₂(SbCl₆)Cl₄] (Py‐SbCl) is shown with crystallographically independent alternating square pyramidal [SbCl₅] and octahedral [SbCl₆] sites sandwiched by organic layers. Interestingly, the octahedral site of the [SbCl₆] can be fully replaced by the In3+ ions, forming the alloyed compound (C₄H₁₂N₂)₅[(SbCl₅)₂(InCl₆)Cl₄] (Py‐SbInCl). More importantly, the latter shows a near‐unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which is ≈7 times of enhancement compared to the pristine Py‐SbCl compound. This is mainly due to the much‐enhanced Young's modulus, higher radiative decay rates and longer electron transient rates, presumably stemming from shorter In─Cl bond distances and higher dipole moments, as revealed by a cocktail study of X‐ray single‐crystal crystallography, density functional theory, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and so on. In addition, it is shown that Py‐SbInCl is an excellent yellow phosphor that can be used for white light‐emitting diodes and other applications such as counterfeiting. Therefore, making site‐specific alloying compounds may open a new design approach for functional bimetallic hybrid materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe trade‐off of the Volmer reaction for *H formation and the Heyrovsky/Tafel Reaction for *H desorption is a crucial challenge in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, aside from the conventional construction of bifunctional active sites to accelerate the water dissociation step, the electronic retrimming of each metal site is also non‐negligible. Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst combining Pt single‐atoms and Pt nanoparticles on the etched boron nitride (eBN) coated carbon nanotube (Pt‐eBN@CNT) is synthesized, where both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps are promoted by the synergistic adsorption of the composite active sites and the electron‐withdrawing effect of eBN carrier, respectively. The proposed catalyst shows impressive performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 25.1 ± 1.7 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and a TOF of 17.1 ± 1.3 s−1 at 0.15 V vs RHE under extremely low metal loading of 6 µgPt cm−2 (catalyst loading of 0.77 mg cm−2), significantly better than those for the commercial benchmark Pt/C (44.2 ± 4.1 mV, 0.9 ± 0.1 s−1 at catalyst loading of 0.77 mg cm−2; 156.1 ± 0.6 mV, 1.6 ± 0.1 s−1 at metal loading of 6 µgPt cm−2) under the same conditions. Moreover, a membrane‐electrode‐assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with Pt‐eBN@CNT as the cathodic catalyst exhibits a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) of 2.0 × 106 C·cm−2 within high‐temperature electrocatalysis at 1.0 A·cm−2, significantly higher than those of state‐of‐the‐art Pt‐based electrocatalysts.

However, achieving controlled analyte release under nonthermal stimuli remains a major challenge. Here, a relay‐type solid‐state host–guest system based on a fluorinated pillararene derivative, EtFLP6, is presented, which enables selective adsorption of 1‐/2‐bromoalkane isomers, room‐temperature‐controlled desorption, and turn‐on colorimetric sensing. Activated EtFLP6 crystals selectively adsorb 1‐bromoalkanes from mixtures of 1‐/2‐positional isomers and release them at room temperature upon introduction of electron‐deficient aromatic acceptors (4‐nitrobenzonitrile and 1,5‐difluoro‐2,4‐dinitrobenzene), triggering a distinct color change from colorless to orange. Single‐crystal structures incorporating X‐ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal that the desorption and color change result from the disassembly of solid‐state host–guest complexes, driven by competitive binding with acceptors. This process is governed by the dynamic intermolecular interactions and selective molecular recognition of EtFLP6 in the solid state. This work bridges traditional macrocyclic adsorbents with functional organic cocrystals, offering a novel strategy for designing intelligent supramolecular materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnergy consumption for buildings and space thermal regulation account for ∼20% of global electricity usage. One of the key measures to alleviate such energy consumption is functionalizing windows to enhance energy generation and reduce temperature regulation expenditures. However, versatile windows that integrate both energy harvesting and temperature regulation remain scarce. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), which are large‐area photon‐harvesting devices, have demonstrated notable advantages as photovoltaic windows due to their building compatibility, but their potential for temperature regulation is generally overlooked. In this work, temperature‐regulated LSCs (TRLSCs) are prepared through high mid‐infrared (MIR) emissive perovskite‐polymer luminescent films and low‐MIR‐emissive transparent electrodes. TRLSCs not only enable favorable photovoltaic performance but also facilitate temperature regulation by tunable radiative cooling and self‐powered heating. Compared to conventional glass, the internal temperature is reduced by up to 12.0 °C via TRLSCs. Utilizing the competitive absorption between luminescent films and transparent electrodes, the cooling range can be conveniently modulated from 5.5–12.0 °C to 3.9–7.9 °C by flipping the TRLSCs, enabling adaptive thermal management. What is more, self‐powered thermal regulation is also achieved by transparent electrodes of TRLSCs for active heating. This work demonstrates the promising future of TRLSCs in functionalized windows and zero‐energy buildings.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChronic diabetic wounds persist as a clinical healthcare challenge. In the hyperglycemic pathological milieu, excessive inflammation, peripheral neuropathy, and vascular disorders impede diabetic wound healing. Immunoregulation is substantially emphasized among these factors; however, research on neurovascular regeneration remains insufficient. Endogenous electric fields (EFs) can regulate cellular behaviors and significantly impact the wound healing process. Herein, a conductive composite hydrogel (CGGP) with ultrasound‐responsive electrical stimulation based on interfacial ion/electron transfer for diabetic wound electrotherapy is proposed. CGGP is synthesized through physicochemical crosslinking of gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) dual networks and incorporated with curcumin‐loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The conductivity of CGGP is comparable to that of skin. Notably, CGGP can generate electrical stimulation based on ion transfer at the fluid–solid interface (electrokinetic effects) and electron transfer at the curcumin‐rGO interface in response to ultrasound. Moreover, CGGP exhibits an ultrasound‐responsive release of curcumin for anti‐inflammatory treatment. The ultrasound‐responsive CGGP can promote the secretion of neurotrophic factors, vessel formation, and fibroblast migration. Furthermore, it facilitates local nerve regeneration, angiogenesis, and matrix remodeling in diabetic rat models, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing. The sonoelectrical CGGP composite hydrogel holds great potential as a promising material for diabetic wound treatment.",

Here, field‐free SOT switching is demonstrated at sub‐nanosecond timescales in a PtTe2/WTe2/CoFeB heterostructure that fulfills all above requirements. The unique combination of WTe2, with its low crystal symmetry, facilitates field‐free SOT switching at reduced current densities, while PtTe2, characterized by its high spin Hall conductivity, enhances energy efficiency. Moreover, the significant in‐plane spin Hall conductivity from PtTe2 contributes to shortening the incubation delay.

Experimental investigation, theoretical calculation, and in situ analysis cooperatively reveal that the “sesame ball”‐like WO3/SnO2 spontaneously generates an internal electric field across the heterointerface, which offers moderate adsorption but rapid diffusion and accelerated conversion towards polysulfides. Meanwhile, the rich heterointerface acting as profitable nucleation sites guides the 3D growth of sulfide and thus impedes the inactivation of catalytic surface.

Early diagnosis of chemotherapy‐induced liver injury (CILI) is critical to prevent its progression into other liver diseases and potential liver failure. However, there is currently a lack of effective tools for early monitoring of CILI. To address this issue, it is developed a glutathione (GSH)‐activated ratiometric second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) nano‐probe, HCy‐CL‐RENPs, which utilizes rare earth ions‐doped nanoparticles (RENPs) as the luminescence signal reporters and hemicyanine dye HCy‐CL as the recognition unit to react with GSH, thereby modulating the NIR‐IIb emission of RENPs. This probe exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for detecting GSH, along with excellent biocompatibility. Utilizing HCy‐CL‐RENPs, it is accurately evaluated the hepatotoxicity of different chemotherapy drugs and successfully detected CILI within 5 h after drug administration, significantly earlier than existing methods such as serum enzyme detection and biopsy. These findings indicate that the probe can facilitate early assessment of liver injury by monitoring changes in GSH levels, providing a robust tool for the early diagnosis of CILI and guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolar interfaces with broken inversion symmetry have garnered significant attention due to their profound influence on charge/spin distribution and propagation, leading to unconventional phenomena such as high‐mobility electron gas, polar skyrmions, and interfacial pyroelectric/pyro‐phototronic effects. Designing and controlling polar interfaces is crucial for developing advanced functional electronic devices. Here, a strategy of polar interface engineering is proposed by modulating the built‐in electric field in Schottky junctions to generate and tune the pyro‐phototronic effect in a centrosymmetric semiconductor (β‐Ga2O3). By varying the work functions of metal electrodes and doping concentrations, the built‐in electric field is effectively controlled, enabling modulation of the effective polarization and pyroelectric coefficient. Leveraging the pyro‐phototronic effect, the Ga2O3 Schottky junction‐based self‐powered photodetector achieves an ultrafast response of 0.2 µs to solar‐blind UV light, representing a 50‐fold improvement over the control device operating with the photoconductive effect. Furthermore, five optoelectronic logic gates are realized, enabled by the bidirectional pyro‐phototronic current during light switching. These findings provide a pathway for exploring novel pyro‐phototronic phenomena in polar‐interface‐engineered semiconductors and advancing ultrafast optoelectronic detection technologies.",

Herein, an α‐boron nanosheet‐coated Zn foil (α‐B@Zn) is presented, aiming at enhancing the performance and stability of Zn metal anodes. The α‐B nanosheets are successfully synthesized via ultrasonic treatment, exhibiting a unique 2D morphology. Thanks to their hydrophobic and insulating properties, the α‐B coating significantly mitigates the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and surface corrosion. Furthermore, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the α‐B layer facilitates the electron donation effect and endows strong chemical affinity to Zn atoms and Zn(002) plane, resulting in fast Zn desolvation kinetics and uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, the α‐B@Zn electrodes maintain satisfactory cycling performance over 2200 h with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. The assembled α‐B@Zn full cell also enables stable discharge capacity up to 4000 cycles with a capacity retention of 95.5%. The findings underscore the efficacy of the α‐B protective layer in achieving high‐performance zinc anodes for next‐generation energy storage systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA rare realization of unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) both below and above the magnetic transition temperature (TC) in a hexagonal noncentrosymmetric magnet Y3Co8Sn4, using a combined experimental and ab initio calculations. Occurrence of such UAHE is mainly attributed to the reciprocal () topology (i.e., the presence of topological Weyl points at/near the Fermi level), along with some contribution from the topological magnetic texture (at low temperatures), as inferred from the measured field‐dependent ac susceptibility. The effect of UAHE on the measured transport behavior however evolves differently with temperature above and below TC = 53 K, suggesting different physical mechanism responsible in the two phases. A unique planar ferrimagnetic ordering is found to be the most stable state with ab‐plane as the easy plane below TC. The simulated net magnetization and the moment per Co atom agrees fairly well with the experimentally measured values. A reasonably large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is also observed in both the phases (above and below TC) of the present compound, which is again not so ubiquitous. The results underscore the family of R3Co8Sn4 (R = rare earth) polar magnets as a compelling backdrop for exploring the synergy of magnetism and topological non‐trivial electronic states, pivotal for spintronic applications.",

Both materials exhibit multienzyme‐like (oxidase‐, peroxidase‐, superoxide dismutase‐, catalase‐like) activities, with Cu‐SLCDs showing higher activity levels. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that, compared to CuN‐CDs, the polyphenol p‐π conjugated structure creates a unique electron‐donating coordination environment, which increases the electron density of Cu‐SLCDs at the Fermi level, enhances electron transfer, and boosts multienzyme‐like activities. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Cu‐SLCDs effectively eliminate over 98.6% of bacteria at a concentration of 25 µg mL−1, while reducing reactive oxygen species levels in normal cells to promoting efficient wound healing. The development of Cu‐SLCDs with optimized CuO4 coordination environment provides a novel approach for infected wound therapy and broadens the potential applications of single‐atom nanozymes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the accelerating depletion of fossil fuels, biomass energy has garnered significant attention as a promising renewable energy source. The electrocatalytic conversion of biomass into high‐value‐added products holds substantial research significance. In this study, the catalyst structure is systematically optimized by fine‐tuning the ratio of adjacent transition metals, nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu), leading to the design of an ultrathin‐layered nanosheet array catalyst, Cu1/8‐NiO@NF. This catalyst exhibits exceptional performance in the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The catalyst shows excellent stability over 40 HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) cycles at a relatively low electrolysis potential of 1.45 V (vs RHE). In a single cycle, the catalyst achieves complete conversion of HMF with 99.5% FDCA yield, 99.6% Faraday efficiency (FE), and nearly complete HMF conversion. A series of electrochemical tests reveals that the incorporation of Cu not only accelerates the formation of NiOOH reactive intermediates but also enhances the charge transfer process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that local substitution of Cu improved HMF adsorption and lowered the reaction energy barrier. This study provides a facile approach for developing efficient electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLithium metal is environmentally sensitive and highly reactive, especially when coupled with flammable organic electrolytes, which pose critical safety challenges for lithium metal batteries under harsh operational conditions. This study tackles this challenge by constructing an integrated strategy for encapsulating lithium metal with a multifunctional polyfluoride ionogel (PFIGE) through in situ thermal polymerization. Based on the cross‐linking network design of hexafluorobutyl methacrylate monomer and 1‐butyl‐3‐lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid plasticizer, C−F group and TFSI− anion cooperate to confer excellent water/oxygen barrier properties of the PFIGE. Meanwhile, the fluorinated skeleton optimizes the Li+ flux by regulating anion migration, thereby promoting the formation of stable inorganic‐rich interphases and achieving homogeneous lithium deposition. Additionally, the C−F group forms ion−dipole interactions with imidazole cations to achieve dynamic self‐healing capabilities, while the condensed‐phase physical barrier and gas‐phase radical scavenging effect of the pyrolyzed PFIGE synergistically contribute to the battery safety. As a proof‐of‐concept, PFIGE‐integrated Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells demonstrate extended cycling stability at high voltage (4.6 V) and high temperature (80 °C), and a 0.4 Ah‐level pouch cell exhibits exceptional resistance to thermal runaway under mechanical/electrical/thermal abuse conditions.

An in‐depth understanding of how molecular configurations affect electronic heterogeneity is still lacking, posing a challenge to interface optimization design. This work presents an effective interface control strategy aimed at achieving spatial homogenization of electronic properties. Using two isomeric D‐π‐A molecules, namely 2‐amino‐nicotinamide and 6‐amino‐nicotinamide, the spatial conformations of the nicotinamide molecules are modulated to achieve different adsorption orientations. Via synergistic intermolecular interactions, facilitating flexible multi‐site adsorption strengthened interactions with the perovskite, promoting uniform redistribution of surface charges, thereby reducing spatial electronic heterogeneity, facilitating energy level alignment, and suppressing nonradiative recombination at the perovskite surface. As a result, blade‐coated perovskite solar cells with a bandgap of 1.67 eV achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.0%. This strategy is expected to play a pivotal role in overcoming existing performance bottlenecks and pushing perovskite solar cells closer to their theoretical efficiency limits.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe molecular weight of conjugated polymers profoundly influences organic solar cell (OSC) efficiency, yet the structural mechanisms driving this relationship remain unresolved. Here, it is demonstrated that polymer conformation, governed by backbone rigidity and persistence length, is the critical determinant of molecular weight dependent performance in bulk‐heterojunction OSCs. By analyzing the benchmark polymers PM6 and D18, opposing trends is uncovered: PM6 achieves peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.11% at low number‐average molecular weight (Mn∼51 kDa), 18.47% at medium‐Mn (68 kDa), and declining to 16.83% at high Mn (122 kDa), whereas D18 improves from 16.87% (41 kDa) to 17.75% (67 kDa) and 19.15% (83 kDa). Neutron scattering and computational modeling reveal that D18's bulky 2‐butyloctyl side chains impose high rotational barriers, stiffening the backbone and extending its persistence length. This rigidity enables high‐Mn D18 to form ordered crystalline domains that enhance charge transport. In contrast, PM6's flexible backbone shortens its persistence length, driving amorphous tie‐chain formation at high Mn that disrupts crystallinity and exacerbates recombination. These results establish polymer conformation and persistence length as universal descriptors linking Mn to microstructure, resolving long‐standing contradictions in polymer design.",

Many respiratory viruses induce indistinguishable clinical symptoms, making accurate detection and effective surveillance challenging. Here, a polarization‐sensitive multiplex biochip is presented utilizing self‐assembled anisotropic nanochains for simultaneous colorimetric detection of multiple pathogens in human nasal, throat, and serum samples. The biochip features a patterned wettability surface, wherein the hydrophobic pattern facilitates precise sample segmentation, blocking the detection interferences. The hydrophilic areas can be utilized not only to print functionalized nanochains for selective identifications of different respiratory viruses, but also to support target preconcentration through the coffee‐ring phenomenon, enhancing the efficiency of virus detection. Furthermore, strong light confinement is shown near the nanochain surface by tailoring incident polarization, which enlarges colorimetric response sensitivity to virus loading. Thus, the simultaneous quantification of various respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and adenovirus, is achieved with a detection limit of 10 PFU mL−1. In clinical tests, influenza patients are successfully distinguished from other volunteers with an accuracy of 96.2%.

This work presents an all‐in‐one analog AI accelerator, combining these capabilities to enable energy‐efficient, continuously adaptable AI systems.

Inference performance is validated through matrix‐vector multiplication simulations on a 64 × 64 array, achieving a root‐mean‐square error improvement by a factor of 20 at 1 s and 3 at 10 years after programming, compared to state‐of‐the‐art.

Herein, an ingenious polyelectrolyte strategy is proposed to effectively control salt accumulation and achieve higher condensate yields through remote and lightweight condensing structures. By sequentially adhering LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2‐δ (NCAL) and selectively modifying polystyrene sodium sulfonate (PSS) on a black polyvinyl alcohol sponge, a three‐dimensional (3D) porous foam structure is conveniently constructed (NCAL@PBS), which features a Donnan exclusion with efficient photothermal conversion and salt‐resistance with balanced water supply. The efficient evaporation rate of optimized NCAL@PBS exhibits 2.80 kg m−2 h−1 under one solar irradiation due to non‐radiative relaxation behavior achieved via oxygen vacancy defects (13%) in the NCAL structure, and low evaporation enthalpy (1621 J g−1), guaranteeing stable and efficient evaporation in complicated environments. The NCAL demonstrates nearly 100% antibacterial efficiency against S. aureus under one sun solar irradiation, attributed to photothermal‐induced hyperthermia that damages bacterial cell walls.

Herein, inspired by the natural secretion of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and colon colonization behavior of probiotics, a biomimetic probiotics platform (OSM) using bicontinuous single primitive metal–phenolic networks (SP‐MPNs) loaded with OMVs derived from E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is developed. Notably, the ordered mesopores, high specific surface area, and excellent antioxidant properties of SP‐MPNs demonstrate a high loading capacity (≈30%, w/w) and protective effects for OMVs. Impressively, OSM not only responds to transferrin (Tf) for the slow release of OMVs but also strongly interacts with mucin in the mucus layers, prolonging the retention time of OMVs in the colon (>48 h). Furthermore, OSM exhibits robust antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. Significantly, in comparison with the probiotic EcN, OSM demonstrates superior adhesion properties, higher OMVs release amount, and eliminates the risk of inducing bacteremia. To protect OSM from gastric acid degradation, OSM is encapsulated into ascorbyl palmitate (AP) to form OMVs@SP‐MPNs@AP (OSMA) hydrogel, which demonstrates preventive and therapeutic efficacy in colitis mouse models. In summary, the biomimetic platform provides a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.",

    "abstract": "AbstractQuantum dots (QDs), with adjustable bandgaps, high interfacial reactivity, and efficient charge transfer, are promising in photocatalytic bacteriostasis. However, challenges like fast charge recombination, instability, and aggregation limit their catalytic efficiency and broader applications. A dual‐carrier system of regenerated cationic cellulose (RCC) and Ga is first proposed to achieve steady‐state CuxS QDs with quantum confinement, sulfur‐rich vacancies, and p‐type Schottky structure, maximizing their photocatalytic activity. The Schottky junction interface and internal electric field accelerate carrier separation, while sulfur vacancies act as hot electron traps, further suppressing electron–hole recombination. Therefore, this ternary composite system demonstrates an optimal bandgap (2.25 eV), low electrochemical impedance, extended photoluminescence decay (9.87 ns), and broad‐spectrum light absorption, thereby improving carrier conversion into ROS, including 1O2. These reactive species high‐efficiently sterilize E. coli, S. aureus, and drag‐resistant bacteria, achieving logarithmic removal values of 6–8 at a high bacterial concentration (108 CFU mL−1) under visible‐light illumination. Pathogen demise primarily results from photo‐excited ROS, which induce instability and even substantial damage to microbial membranes, leading to excessive oxidative stress and degradation of essential cellular components, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and DNA. This study introduces an innovative organic/inorganic strategy for designing semiconductor QD‐based disinfection photocatalysts.",

In RTT‐TT‐4F, these pronounced aggregation features endow its blend film with appropriate phase separation, thereby reducing charge recombination, balancing charge carrier mobilities, and significantly lowering energy loss in OSCs.

The resultant catalyst, Zn@PD‐iCOF, achieves remarkable yields (up to 99%) of cyclic carbonates in carbon dioxide (CO2)‐epoxides cycloaddition reactions under mild conditions (at 80 °C, 0.1 MPa CO2) without the need for co‐catalysts and solvents, superior to most previously reported ionic catalysts. This exceptional performance stems from hierarchically ordered pores structure, fully exposed dual active sites (ion pair and Lewis acid site), and their synergistic electronic coupling. Moreover, the catalyst retains >90% activity over twelve consecutive cycles, demonstrating exceptional stability.

However, it remains challenging to achieve synchronized tracing of different behaviors for the same cell due to the lack of a multimodal imaging probe. Herein, through flexible polypeptide linkers, S‐L‐D‐S and G‐S‐S‐G, a multifunctional probe is constructed by fusing three imaging proteins, including bioluminescent imaging reporter (NanoLuc), fluorescent protein (mRuby2), and calcium indicator (GCamp6f). A lentivirus carrying the triple‐fusion probe is prepared for stable transfection of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). During the long‐term differentiation of hiPSCs into neural lineage cells and human cerebral organoids (hCOs), the multifunctional probe could be used for bioluminescent imaging with ≈10‐cell sensitivity, single‐cell fluorescent imaging, and functional imaging of calcium activity. Then, hiPSC‐derived neural progenitors and hCOs are transplanted into the mouse brains. Multimodal imaging is performed to trace the survival, distribution, integration, and functional activity of transplanted cells, providing multi‐scale data of exogenous cell behavior and fate in host brains. These results demonstrate that the triple‐fusion probe could be a powerful tool for the comprehensive evaluation of cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGraphene oxide (GO) membranes are promising candidates to revolutionize nanofiltration, due to their atomic thickness and ultrafast water transport. Yet their practical use is hindered by structural damage under high pressure. Conventional strategies like thickening membranes, reducing interlayer spacing, or cross‐linking nanosheets improve pressure resistance but significantly reduce water permeability to impractical levels (e.g., 0.15 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 at 60 bar). Here, this dilemma is addressed by designing ultrathin GO/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid membranes. The CNT network reinforces the stacked GO nanosheets by reducing their free‐standing diameter while increasing membrane thickness and Young's modulus. The pressure resistance is achieved up to 60 bar, triple that of the pristine GO membranes. A maximum water flux of 966 ± 96 L m−2 h−1 is achieved by a 68 nm thick GO/CNT membrane with optimal GO nanosheet size and CNT loading amount, facilitating 1–3 orders of magnitude higher water flux per unit membrane thickness than all available membranes. This breakthrough resolves the critical trade‐offs among pressure resistance, flux, and membrane thickness, marking a transformative leap in GO‐based nanofiltration efficiency. The innovation holds immediate potential for applications in sustainable water remediation, pharmaceuticals, energy storage, and electronics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBone tumors are challenging to eradicate, with conventional limb‐salvage surgeries often leading to high rates of recurrence, metastasis, and severe functional impairments due to large bone defects. Traditional therapies struggle to balance tumor elimination with bone preservation and functional restoration. This study presents a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing high‐purity biodegradable magnesium (Mg) implants, which induce dual‐mode bone tumor death orchestrated by the cGAS‐STING pathway. Released Mg ions trigger autophagic cell death through TRPM7‐mediated uptake, with cGAS‐STING promoting LC3 lipidation by supplying STING‐laden ERGIC membranes. Simultaneously, alkaline degradation byproducts disrupt tumor metabolism by suppressing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, with cGAS‐STING further targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2) to amplify metabolic collapse. This coordinated mechanism reshapes the tumor microenvironment, promoting M1 macrophage polarization, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and enhanced intratumoral IFN‐γ secretion, fostering a robust, sustained immune response. The therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of Mg implants are validated in murine osteosarcoma, patient‐derived xenografts, and VX2 rabbit bone tumor models, demonstrating significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival without systemic toxicity. This work highlights the multifunctional capabilities of biodegradable Mg implants, integrating autophagic death, metabolic suppression, and immune modulation through cGAS‐STING coordination, presenting a promising and clinically translatable strategy for advanced bone tumor therapy.",

Here, the Fe3O4‐FeCo‐Fe5C2 ternary catalyst was successfully constructed. Notably, the different contents of Co doping optimized the heterogeneous catalytic interface of the FeCo alloy clusters, which promoted the targeted conversion of CO2 to light olefins in high yield (22.4%) and effectively suppressed the generation of CO (4.4%). The study shows that the formation of FeCo alloy clusters significantly promotes the forward progression of the Reverse Water‐Gas Reaction (RWGS), which can greatly enhance the conversion of CO2 and inhibit the formation of CO according to Le Chatelier's principle. Moreover, the FeCo alloy clusters significantly promoted the rapid formation of CHx and induced the chain growth of CHx on Fe5C2 phase. Hence, the clever construction of FeCo alloy clusters significantly strengthens the kinetic coupling between the RWGS and FTS reactions. Additionally, the in‐situ structural evolution of the catalysts, along with the real‐time formation process of the products, was monitored through in‐situ characterization. This work is promising to provide an effective strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to achieve high yields of light olefins over FeCo alloy clusters.",

Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) results reveal the local chemical environment of the activated hydrogen species, which can be transferred for room‐temperature hydrogenation reactions.

The w‐MnSe exhibits an altermagnet semiconducting nature characterized by a direct bandgap of 1.98 eV and spin splitting of up to 245 meV in the valence band structure.

The ferroelectric critical temperature (TC) of 965 K is obtained, and this may indicate excellent thermal stability. The correlation is postulated between altermagnetim and ferroelectricity to control spin orientation mediated by the rotation of polyhedra formed by nonmagnetic elements within the lattice structure.

These findings reveal that high glucose microenvironments generate excessive reactive oxygen species in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic impairment. These pathophysiological disruptions suppress osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs while driving pro‐inflammatory polarization in BMDMs, processes closely tied to high‐glucose‐induced inhibition of Adenosine 5′‐monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Restoration of AMPK phosphorylation emerges as a pivotal strategy to mitigate oxidative stress and restore cellular function. To address this, a dual‐targeted therapeutic system (DLNPs@HA hydrogel) is developed that combines anti‐CD105‐antibody‐modified nanoliposomes and phosphatidylserine‐modified nanoliposomes, both encapsulating the specific AMPK activator α‐lipoic acid. This hydrogel facilitates sustained nanoparticle release, enabling precise and effective delivery to BMSCs and BMDMs. In vitro, DLNPs@HA hydrogel successfully enhances osteogenic activity and suppresses inflammatory responses. In vivo, it accelerates fracture healing in diabetic mice. By precisely targeting BMSCs and BMDMs and reversing bicellular oxidative stress, this integrative medical‐engineering strategy provides a promising and translatable solution for diabetic fracture repair, seamlessly bridging mechanistic insights with therapeutic innovation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next‐generation energy storage systems owing to their inherent cost advantages. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of SIBs faces critical limitations in energy density compared to commercial lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), posing a significant barrier to their widespread applications. Enhancing energy density through both the development of high specific energy cathode materials and the implementation of elevated operational voltages represents a dual‐pronged strategic approach. However, voltage elevation typically accelerates system degradation through multiple mechanisms including accelerated electrolyte decomposition, loss of reactive oxygen, cathode particle cracking, and transition metal cation (TMn+) migration and deposition. This review summarizes the key challenges from SIBs operated at high‐voltages, and discuss the main strategies to overcome these challenges in terms of high specific energy layered oxide cathode materials and electrolyte design. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the fundamental science behind the challenges, and to provide potential solutions for achieving the goal of high‐energy SIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) recently emerges as a prospective cathode for lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries owing to its high S utilization, remarkable cycling stability, and liberty from shuttle effect. Despite weakly solvating ether electrolytes exhibiting simultaneously compatibility for SPAN cathode and lithium (Li) anode, they universally suffer from low ionic conductivity and narrow liquid‐phase temperature range. However, conventional ether‐based electrolytes with excellent ionic conductivity cannot realize reversible solid–solid conversion of SPAN cathode due to Li polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) dissolving and shuttling. Here, a series of weakly solvating ethers are evaluated by selectively methylating dimethoxymethane (DMM) to fine‐tune their solvation capability and liquid‐phase temperature range. Enlightened from weakly solvating ether electrolytes, the contact ion pair (CIP)‐dominated electrolyte is designed for satisfactory ionic conductivity of electrolyte and reversible solid–solid conversion of SPAN cathode over wide temperature range. The reinforcement mechanisms of the CIP‐dominated electrolyte for the Li anode and SPAN cathode are comprehensively elucidated through experimental characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the optimized electrolyte, Li||SPAN full cells can steadily operate over wide temperature range from −20 to 60 °C. Furthermore, the 120 mAh Li||SPAN pouch cell can exhibit 85.5% capacity retention after 45 cycles at 0.2 C.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe controllable two‐step deposition of perovskite films is advantageous for large‐area manufacturing. However, the incomplete reaction between the initially deposited lead iodide (PbI2) layer and subsequent organic ammonium salts remains a significant challenge, which ultimately degrades the perovskite film quality. Differing from the conventional PbI2 porosity regulation or PbI2‐based intermediate phase engineering, this study innovatively introduces N‐methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and isopropylamine hydrochloride (IPACl) in the organic salt solution to synergistically modulate the crystal growth of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films. The research findings suggest that the coordinative solvent, NMP, can partially dissolve the initially deposited compact PbI2 layer while simultaneously in situ forming the PbI2‐NMP adducts, thereby promoting the formation of α‐phase perovskite. Further integration of IPACl plays a role in the van der Waals interaction, enhancing the oriented growth of α‐phase perovskite and suppressing the δ‐phase formation during thermal annealing. Consequently, highly crystalline FAPbI3 films featuring enlarged grain size, more uniform morphology, smoother surface, and lower defect density are demonstrated, rendering a champion efficiency of 25.50% for two‐step processed perovskite solar cells, along with significantly improved stability. Moreover, the doctor‐blade coated solar mini‐modules demonstrate champion efficiencies of 20.30% and 16.06% with aperture areas of 16 and 100 cm2, respectively.",

To address this limitation, a novel approach inspired by 2D cellular solids is introduced, utilizing discrete conformal mapping of perforated 2D cellular layouts onto TPMS surfaces to minimize distortion during 3D mapping. This study focuses on primitive (P)‐type Conformally Perforated Shellular Metamaterials (CPSMs), evaluating their thermomechanical and acoustic properties through computational analyses and experimentation on 3D‐printed samples. Effective thermomechanical properties are determined via asymptotic homogenization, which demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of CPSMs can be calculated by multiplying the effective thermal conductivities of the 3D shellular and 2D thermally‐isotropic cellular architectures. Thermal conductivity and elastic stiffness are systematically enhanced by engineering the shell's in‐plane architecture while preserving the 3D topology. The optimized design demonstrates a significant increase in elastic stiffness compared to an intact P‐shellular of the same density. Numerical and experimental results reveal that the 2D‐mapped architecture effectively tunes the acoustic bandwidth and bandgap frequency range of CPSMs, achieving a 79% increase in bandwidth and a 34% reduction in material density compared to an intact P‐shellular. These findings highlight CPSMs' potential for structural, thermal, and acoustic applications, advancing the development of additively manufactured TPMS‐based multifunctional metamaterials.",

The Na+ (de)insertion mechanisms of the KCu7S4 anode are comprehensively elucidated through a combination of in situ TEM/SAED/XRD analyses and theoretical calculations. The detailed intermediates (Na3Cu4S4, NaCuS) and final products (CuS, Cu) during (de)sodiation processes are identified, revealing that the highly mobile Cu+ ion can facilitate the formation of tunnel‐structured Na3Cu4S4 and layer‐structured NaCuS during the electrochemical reaction process. The reaction dynamics indicate that the formation of Na3Cu4S4 and NaCuS intermediates facilitates electron transfer and ion diffusion during Na+ (de)insertion. Moreover, the KCu7S4 anode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 337 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1, and the corresponding Na3V2(PO4)3//KCu7S4 full cell delivers a high energy density of 303 Wh kg−1 at 375 W kg−1, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.

    "abstract": "AbstractFor gas‐forming electrochemical reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the unavoidable adhesion of the produced gas bubbles to the electrode often compromises the access of the electrolyte to the catalytically active sites and the subsequent electron transfer processes, overall perturbing the performance of the electrochemical reaction. To address this important challenge, a few extremely bubble repellent coatings have been introduced in the recent past — but at expense of diminished electrochemically active surface areas and reaction kinetics. Here, a metal‐free, robust coating on nickel foam (NF) following electro deposition of a single component, i.e., polyglycerol‐modified pyrrole, without incurring any wastage is introduced. The polyglycerol moiety ensures extreme gas‐bubble repellence due to low bubble adhesion forces, permitting the early detachment of produced hydrogen gas bubbles. On the other side, the conjugated polypyrrole chain facilitates the electron transfer process within and through the coating. These synergistic attributes enable HER with a reduced overpotential (28% at 100 mA cm−2), a smaller Tafel slope (84.2 vs 100.8 mV dec−1), and an increased electrochemically active surface area by 104% as compared to the underlying bare NF electrode.",

However, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still lag behind those of their 3D counterparts, primarily due to the poor charge‐carrier transport associated with the insulating bulky organic spacer cations. In this work, a series of halogenated chiral organic spacers–S‐α‐fluorophenylethylamine acrylate (S‐α‐FPEAAA), S‐α‐chlorophenylethylamine acrylate (S‐α‐ClPEAAA), and S‐α‐bromophenylethylamine acrylate (S‐α‐BrPEAAA)–are employed to regulate charge transport within the 2DRP framework. Incorporating halogen atoms facilitates halogen–halogen interactions between the organic spacers and the PbI64− octahedral framework, thereby enhancing structural ordering and electronic coupling. Among these, the S‐α‐BrPEAAA‐based perovskites exhibit superior film morphology, improved crystallinity, and an exceptional carrier lifetime of 3.353 µs. Notably, an inverted perovskite solar cell based on S‐α‐BrPEAAA achieves a high PCE of 20.30%, rivaling the best‐performing systems reported recently. Moreover, the device demonstrates excellent long‐term stability, retaining over 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of storage under nitrogen atmosphere. These findings highlight the potential of halogenated chiral organic spacers in advancing high‐performance and stable 2D perovskite photovoltaics.",

A combination of UV and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is applied to provide a comprehensive atomic‐scale understanding of the heterointerface. These results reveal that the P−P dimers in the first monolayer remain intact during the initial ALD cycles, while oxygen preferentially binds between indium in the second monolayer and phosphorus in the first monolayer, leading to the formation of interfacial indium phosphate (InPOx) species. The presence of chlorine residues from the TiCl4 precursor persists throughout the deposition process and influences the chemical environment of the interface. Band alignment analysis confirms the formation of a type‐II heterojunction, characterized by a valence band offset of approximately 2.3 eV and a conduction band offset of 0.45 eV, facilitating charge carrier separation essential for high‐efficiency photoelectrochemical applications.

The sustainable release of the captured REEs is promoted through the synergistic integration of a redox‐reaction for electrostatic repulsion, and in situ proton generation for ion‐exchange, all driven by photoelectrochemistry. The platform consists of a redox‐copolymer, poly(ferrocenylpropyl methacrylamide‐co‐methacrylic acid) (P(FPMAm‐co‐MAA)) (PFM), conjugated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and coated onto titanium dioxide nanorods (TNRs). The (PFM‐CNT)/TNR spontaneously adsorbs up to 214.2 mg of Yttrium/g PFM by ion‐exchange, and demonstrates broad applicability for other REEs. The adsorbed REEs are released through the PEC oxidation of ferrocene (Fc) to ferrocenium (Fc+), and the simultaneous PEC water splitting reactions at the TNRs that protonate the carboxylate binding groups. This dual photoelectrochemically‐driven mechanism for REE release is investigated by in situ pH measurements, as well as vibrational and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Through PEC approaches, a 68.8% reduction in energy consumption during REE recovery has been achieved compared to purely electrochemical systems, with a regeneration efficiency close to 100%. For NdFeB magnets from waste hard disk drives, Nd and Dy recovery efficiencies of 59.2 and 61.1% are achieved. The dual‐functionality of these copolymer PEC systems offers a sustainable platform for modulating critical element recovery.",

Electron microscopy and synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the randomly mixed coordination environments of the constituent elements, underscoring the excellent atomic mixing within the nanoframes. These nanoframes demonstrated a 9.72‐fold higher acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) specific activity at an overpotential of −0.1 V than commercial Pt/C catalysts, remarkable durability after 15 000 potential cycles, and competitive performance as cathode catalysts for practical applications in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Density functional theory calculations attributed the superior HER performance to {110}‐enclosed atomically mixed surfaces and low‐coordination sites, optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) near the ideal value of 0.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUltrafine nanocatalysts can provide abundant catalytic sites, but typically it is less stable and susceptible to dissolution diffusion. Here, this work reports a selenium‐mediated strategy to construct sub‐nanometers amorphous shell on ultrafine Pt nanocrystal core, forming a Pt@PtSex core/shell nanostructure. In this developed strategy, the active Se‐oleylamine precursor after Pt nucleation confines the overgrowth and oriented attachment of Pt, allowing the in situ formation of core/shell nanostructures combining ultrafine size and sub‐nano amorphous shell. Essentially, the sub‐nano amorphous PtSex shell can not only optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy and lower the water dissociation energy, but also retard the dissolution of Pt atoms, thus leading to significantly improved activity and durability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The overall water splitting can be driven by a small cell voltage of 1.48/1.53 V at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4/1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, Pt@PtSex‐1 with ≈0.8 nm thick amorphous shell exhibits ultra‐high mass activity of 75.2 A mgPt−1 in acidic and 18.4 A mgPt−1 in alkaline at −70 mV, as well as a robust durability with stable operation for 1100 h at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline (1300 h at 160 mA cm−2 in acidic), superior to the most reported Pt‐based electrocatalysts.",

This work presents a one‐pot two‐step linear sequence for the efficient deracemization of β‐chlorohydrins by combining a photocatalytic alcohol oxidation with a stereoselective carbonyl bioreduction using alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Despite the thermodynamic challenges of the oxidation step for this family of substrates, three efficient photochemical conditions under white light irradiation were found using catalytic 2,4,6‐triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPPT) or 2,3‐dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ) in this case in stoichiometric or by in situ regeneration of the catalyst. In addition, its sunlight‐driven applicability and its implementation in flow chemistry were demonstrated. After testing the scope of these methodologies, 2‐chloro‐1‐arylethanols were found as suitable substrates. For those β‐halohydrins oxidized with complete conversion, the deracemization strategy was successfully achieved yielding twelve enantiopure (R)‐ and (S)‐β‐halohydrins. Furthermore, 2‐chloro‐1‐phenylethanol enantiomers were subjected to an additional chemical cyclization under basic conditions, providing both (R)‐ and (S)‐styrene oxide in a three‐step one‐pot process and without loss of the optical activity.",

However, conventional synthesis routes are limited in scale. Therefore, a novel spray‐drying method is presented herein, enabling a scalable synthesis of LMO sorbents for Li extraction. The ion‐exchange material is studied in both synthetic LiCl solutions and two different geothermal brines from the Upper Rhine Valley, demonstrating improved Li selectivity and extraction capabilities compared to materials from hydrothermal synthesis approaches. The extraction behavior in relevant mildly acidic environments is studied in detail. Further material improvements are achieved by substituting a fraction of Mn by Ti, which greatly reduced the dissolution of manganese during acid treatment in the first 5 extraction cycles from 5.6% to only 1.8%. In addition, the maximum sorption capacity of the Ti‐substituted LMO (LMTO) can be further increased from 5.05 mmol g for LMO (35.1 mg g) to 5.66 mmol g for LMTO (39.3 mg g) under optimized m/V ratios. Hence, the results reported herein present a pathway toward LMO‐based ion‐exchange materials for the direct lithium extraction on an industrial scale.",

Sustainable and environment‐friendly surfactants offer a promising solution for mitigating these impacts. This study introduces an emulsifier composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and partially cation‐substituted hyaluronate (CHA), both of which are derived from abundant and cost‐effective natural polysaccharides. The synergistic interplay of electrostatic interactions and controlled molecular entanglement between these macromolecules significantly enhances the stability and ripening resistance of the water‐in‐oil emulsion. This optimized formulation demonstrates remarkable longevity, maintaining emulsion integrity for over 365 days while exhibiting exceptional salt tolerance and pH stability across various environmental conditions. Additionally, this entangled polysaccharide‐based Pickering emulsion demonstrated strong adhesion to leaf surfaces, resisting the effects of strong winds and the water‐repellent properties of the lotus leaves. These characteristics associated with microbial compatibility suggest that emulsifiers based on CNCs and CHA provide safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants, especially pertinent to the agrochemical sector.",

Here, we reveal that [HSO4−] and water can collaboratively promote the rate‐limiting step of the CH bond breaking on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 catalyst. An in‐depth study suggests that water mediates hole transfer to the CH bond while [HSO4−] facilitates electron extraction, thus promoting electron and proton transfer on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 surface. Consequently, photocatalytic DMF coupling over Ru‐ZnIn2S4 produces diesel fuel precursors (DFPs) and H2 with benchmarking formation rates of 1.5 g gcatal.−1 h−1 and 9.7 mmol gcatal.−1 h−1, respectively. Moreover, the selectivity of branched‐chain DFPs reaches 55%. This work puts forward new insight and strategy for photocatalytic CC coupling for the synthesis of biofuels.",

Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is one of these technologies in which catalysts play an essential role. In this work, the impact of impurities in catalysts on the output of RCF is investigated. It is found that the yield of phenolic monomers is almost not influenced by the residual chloride (Cl) ions in the commercially available Ru/C catalyst. However, the presence of Cl ions in the catalyst facilitated hemicellulose removal and delignification. Moreover, the enzymatic conversion rate of cellulose in the solid residue increases after RCF, attributed to the enhanced removal of lignin and hemicellulose in the presence of Cl ions. The impact of Cl ions can be eliminated by removing the Cl ions in the catalyst. This work provides an engineering perspective for upscaling RCF technology using large‐scale synthesized catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Developing a selective lignin depolymerization process remains a daunting challenge due to lignin's inherent structural heterogeneity and chemical complexity. This study used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction to produce oligomeric lignin with controlled structural characteristics (narrow size distribution, lower molecular weight) and further subjected it to oxidative depolymerization using peracetic acid as an oxidant. Oxidation of lignin resulting from lactic acid/pyrazole and choline chloride/lactic acid extraction produces phenolic acids (Ph‐COOH) and dicarboxylic acid (DCA) as significant products. Our results show that the judicial choice of DES during extraction plays a critical role in determining the lignin chemical structure, which follows different oxidation pathways and results in different product selectivities. The generalization of this concept has been established with two different parent lignins, e.g., Douglas fir (D.fir) and wheat straw (WS). The overall process showed that the novel DES extraction not only provides a sustainable pathway for high‐purity lignin generation but also could be used as a tool to produce high‐value products selectively upon its oxidation, thus improving the overall lignin biorefinery process.",

However, both monomer and polymer syntheses typically require anaerobic and moisture‐free conditions, often employing hazardous reagents and solvents that limit scalability. Herein, efficient, scalable syntheses for poly(ethyl lipoate) and ethyl lipoate that incorporate Green Chemistry principles are disclosed. The synthesis of ethyl lipoate from lipoic acid on a 100‐gram scale (>80% yield) is optimized lowering the E‐factor (2.27) by an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Diphenyl phosphate, a nonhazardous commercial organic acid, is used to synthesize ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethyl lipoate) on a 50‐gram scale from cationic ROP (CROP). The polymerizations proceed under ambient atmosphere in low‐hazard and renewable solvents, and a mild depolymerization strategy to regenerate the monomer is developed. Due to their extreme molar mass, the materials possess unique mechanical and physical properties. Life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted on synthetic and recycling processes shows that the polydisulfide has competitive environmental impacts comparable to several commodity polymers, despite the latter having an efficiency advantage due to economies of scale. These discoveries establish an economical and scalable closed‐loop polymer platform that can be broadly applied to various polydisulfides sourced from 1,2‐dithiolanes such as lipoic acid.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents three sulfone‐ or cyano‐decorated photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with adjustable arm lengths and linkages for photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is found that, upon replacing imine linkage with cyanated vinylene, under the irrdation of visible light, the H2O2 production rates (HPR) considerably increases from 2261 μmol h‐1 g‐1 to 7613 μmol h‐1 g‐1 in pure water and O2 atmosphere without the assistance of any sacrificial agent. Even though in air atmosphere, its HPR value still reaches 6339 μmol h‐1 g‐1 with good recyclability. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to the the enhanced polarity through the incoporation of strong polar sulfone or cyano groups in the COF frameworks, which brings about the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, high photocurrent intensity and low charge resistance as well as the increased surface hydrophilicity. The photocatalytic mechanism is studied by means of the theoretical calculations and comparative experiments conducted under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of the various scavengers for electron, hole, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical in the reaction system.",

    "abstract": "Molecular metal complexes form an important class of catalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) or formic acid (HCOOH), key processes in the context of the requested exploration of novel sources of carbon, alternative to fossil fuels. Research studies are most generally carried out with pure gas streams of CO2, while the available real sources of CO2 are gases coming out from industrial plants and containing a low share of CO2, and a great diversity of impurities including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Here, we show that a molecular catalyst, [Rh(bpy)(Cp*)Cl]Cl (bpy = bipyridine, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), catalyzes CO2RR to formic acid using a quasi flue gas (5‐10% CO2 and 100 ppm NO2 or 50 ppm SO2) with substantial selectivity. This is made possible thanks to the modification of the cathode surface with a positively charged imidazolium layer, which greatly favors CO2RR over competing reactions, proton, NO2 and SO2 reductions. These results highlight the potential of combining molecular catalysis and electrode surface modification for electroreduction of diluted CO2 without prior carbon capture or purification.",

However, their synthesis often requires complicated reaction conditions limiting their scalability. In this study, we present a straightforward and scalable synthesis method for a BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C oxy‐electride composite via carboxylic acid complexation (pseudo‐Pechini) followed by carbothermal reduction. The resulting composite exhibits significant surface area, of ~41 m2 g‐1, which is considerably higher than the electrides prepared by solid‐state synthesis. Upon loading with ruthenium, the BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C composite demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis, achieving rates of 3090 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 0.6Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C, and 3737 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 1.1Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C at mild reaction conditions (400 °C and 1 bar). Comprehensive characterization through XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and STEM‐EDS confirmed the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, while iodometric titration method and EPR analysis confirmed the electride‐like nature of the resulting composite.

Liquid catalytic fuel cells (LCFCs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to utilize complex biomass fuels directly. However, conventional LCFCs face challenges related to the cross‐membrane permeation of catalysts, which leads to electrolyte imbalance and cell failure. To address the issue, this study proposed a novel LCFC system using the same catalyst, molybdovanadophosphoric heteropolyacid (PMoV), on both the anode and cathode, effectively mitigating catalyst permeation. Under ambient conditions, the PMoV‐LCFC system achieved a maximum power density of 3.39 mW cm−2 using glucose as the fuel, and the system demonstrated stable performance over five days. Notably, cyclic discharge tests using expired bread as fuel further show the system's effectiveness. The total organic carbon degradation rate reached a maximum of 23.36%, and formic acid was the primary intermediate. The PMoV‐LCFC system effectively reduced catalyst crossover and maintained stable electrochemical performance, offering new insights for designing biomass fuel cells and significantly contributing to waste management.",

In this work, we have demonstrated a hydrophobic tetrapodal receptor Se4Me‐PF6, that exhibits iodine adsorption from an aqueous phase via chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction. In the solution phase, NMR studies reveal that Se4Me‐PF6 selectively recognizes iodide (I−) over other anions. On the other hand, in the solid state, selenoimidazolium building units of Se4Me‐PF6 facilitate self‐assembly into a porous 1D supramolecular ChB framework, enabling efficient iodine adsorption. Consequently, Se4Me‐PF6 has propelled the rapid adsorption of iodine, with a high kinetic rate of 2.10 × 10−3 g·mg−1·min−1, while maintaining its effectiveness under competitive environmental conditions, including pH variations and the presence of interfering anions. Mechanistic investigations using XPS, and DFT studies indicate that iodine capture occurs via a combination of ChB interactions and electrostatic forces provided by the selenoimidazolium motifs. Importantly, Se4Me‐PF6 demonstrates its potential as a stationary phase for column‐based iodine removal, highlighting its applicability in real‐world scenarios. Thus, these findings offer a promising approach for developing iodine adsorbent materials.",

Alkali metals, budget friendly and commonly used as additives to optimize the performance of Pt‐based alloy catalysts, are extensively utilized in the PDH industry. Herein, the structure and catalytic performance of the commercial catalyst (PtK2/θ‐Al2O3) and contrast samples (Pt0.3K0.8/θ‐Al2O3‐N and Pt0.3/θ‐Al2O3) are analyzed. According to the catalytic test, the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 exhibits better catalytic performance, which achieves >95% propylene selectivity and maintaining a high propane yield (>36%) during stability testing. Observations reveal that the initial propylene selectivity of the Pt‐based catalysts is inversely correlated with the total acidity and strong acid site content. The introducing of K element significantly reduces the acidity of the catalyst and enhances the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the presence of Cl−, co‐introduced with K, improves the catalytic stability, while the slight increase in the acidity of catalysts decreases the propylene selectivity. The enrichment of the electron density of PtK2 nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggest that lower propylene adsorption energy and higher barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation reaction on the PtK2‐(100) surface enhance the propylene selectivity of the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 catalyst.",

Nevertheless, the leakage risk and inferior electrode compatibility impede their further application toward high‐performance SMBs. Herein, a novel DEE based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSi) and ethyl‐2‐cyano‐3‐ethoxyacrylate (ECE) is developed through their Lewis acid–base interaction and the further ECE‐based deep eutectic gel electrolyte (GE) is constructed with cross‐linked ploy(vinylene carbonate) (PVC) as matrix network. It is demonstrated that incorporating electron‐withdrawing PVC polymer into the ECE‐based DEE changes the coordination environment of Na+ ions, thus facilitating the Na‐ions desolvation and transport and leading to a high transference number of Na‐ions (0.7). Moreover, the strong interaction between PVC chains and Na‐ions can induce the preferential reduction of PVC to form O‐rich inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thus promoting the electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability with superior long‐term cycling stability. Benefiting from the stable SEI layer, the Na3V2(PO4)3//Na cell with GE displays outstanding cycling (capacity retention of 94.5% after 300 cycles at 1C) and rate (high capacity of 75.5 mAh g−1 at 2 °C) performance than that of ECE‐based DEE cell, showcasing the promising application of advanced deep eutectic GE in high performance SMBs.",

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy experiments show that the charge‐transfer resistance (RCT) follows the same trend as EGOPd activity, with the 3:1 Pd:Ag electrode having the lowest RCT. Electrolysis with this electrode at 0.705 V vs. RHE, where Pd is reduced, results in glycolate production with no overoxidation to formate or oxalate.

The incorporation of fluorine was confirmed through cross‐sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which revealed a correlation between fluorine doping and the partial reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+. The impact of fluorine doping on the structural stability of LiNiO2 was investigated using in‐situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Remarkably, single atom loading and H2 generation activity correlate linearly over a wide range of Pt loading (0.16–1.41 at%). The findings not only open a new avenue for the synthesis and use of single atoms in photocatalysis but also highlight the use of gas‐phase scattering as a simple, scalable, and versatile approach for single‐atom catalyst fabrication.",

The batches of Bi2Sn2O7/CD are synthesized by hydrothermal method with varying carbon dot contents and they are thoroughly characterized to obtain their structural, morphological, textural and compositional information. The carbon dots in the nanocomposite offered photosensitizing behaviour. About 96% photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride is achieved in 40 min (k = 0.072 min‐1), which is 3.6 times higher than pristine Bi2Sn2O7. The rate of singlet oxygen production in the reaction medium has been studied with respect to sunlight exposure time by EPR, which is described as a key for enhanced photocatalytic degradation. In addition, the batch of Bi2Sn2O7/(CD)3.0 as an electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is revealed from low overpotential 136 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and Tafel slope of 41 mV dec‐1 in 1M KOH, corresponding to high mass activity of 22.2 A g‐1 and high specific activity 0.018 mA cm‐2 at η=350 mV.

    "abstract": "Cathode active material is the most valuable component of spent lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), accounting for approximately 30% of their overall value. Direct recycling of cathode materials involves recovering, regenerating, and reusing them without breaking down their chemical structure. This approach maximizes the added value of the cathode compound and reduces manufacturing costs by avoiding the need for virgin material production. However, one key challenge in scaling direct recycling from lab to industry is the requirement for highly purified cathode materials, contrasting with the low purity of black mass generated from battery shredding. No efficient separation process currently exists to isolate different lithium‐nickel‐manganese‐cobalt oxides (NMCs) from each other. Thus, direct recycling technologies that can operate with mixtures of multiple NMC stoichiometries will be best‐suited for industrial adoption. This study explores the direct recycling of NMC mixtures into NMC 622 using a \"reciprocal ternary molten salts (RTMS)\" system. Ionothermal relithiation and upcycling within the RTMS system successfully restore the layered structure, lithium content, and electrochemical performance of degraded NMCs, yielding results comparable to pristine NMC 622 (P‐NMC 622).",

Herein, zeolite‐catalyzed glycerol valorization offers a mature way to create higher‐value chemicals. This study aims to identify the key factors influencing process efficiency by examining the reaction mechanisms of glycerol valorization using 10‐membered ring zeolites: ZSM‐5 (MFI, 3D), MCM‐22 (MWW, 2D), and ZSM‐22 (TON, 1D), each with unique topologies and channel structures. Strategic integration of catalytic studies with advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ UV‐vis and solid‐state NMR spectroscopy, reveals that zeolite topology plays a key role in determining catalytic performance and product selectivity. Zeolites with cages or intersectional voids (e.g., ZSM‐5, MCM‐22) promote the production of aromatic compounds, whereas the cage/void‐free ZSM‐22 favors acrolein formation. Simultaneously, zeolite channels balance the dual cycle mechanism by mediating between diffusion‐friendly straight channels (i.e., in ZSM‐5 and ZSM‐22) and diffusion‐restrictive sinusoidal channels (i.e., in ZSM‐5 and MCM‐22), affecting efficiency and selectivity. This study underscores the critical role of zeolite architecture in determining catalytic outcomes, providing mechanistic insights that bridge the structure‐performance gap.",

This alarming rise has intensified global efforts to mitigate climate change through carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies. Among these, the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals including formic acid and formate salts has emerged as a promising strategy. Formic acid is a versatile chemical and a potential hydrogen carrier, addressing challenges in hydrogen storage and transport. However, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid is thermodynamically challenging and to overcome these barriers, researchers have explored alternative pathways. Considering bicarbonate advantages, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of hydrogen‐driven bicarbonate conversion technologies, focusing on key catalytic routes: photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis and enzymatic catalysis. Each method leverages distinct energy inputs‐ heat, light, electricity and enzymes, to drive the conversion of bicarbonate, with varying efficiencies. Despite significant progress, challenges such as low production rates, catalyst stability and scalability remain.

Building upon prior research involving waste‐derived materials, this study develops a hydrothermal sulfurization technique that transforms New Zealand slash into sulfur‐doped, highly graphitized carbon materials with excellent energy storage properties. The hydrothermally sulfurized slash‐derived electrode material (C‐HS‐New Zealand Slash (NZS)) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 148 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. A supercapacitor device assembles with the C‐HS‐NZS electrode achieves a capacitance of 440 F g−1 at the same current density. The energy density reaches 15.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. Furthermore, the C‐HS‐NZS‐based device delivers a maximum capacitance of 384 F g−1 and retains 360 F g−1 after 10,000 cycles, demonstrating excellent capacity retention and long‐term electrochemical stability.",

Developing biobased thermosets with efficient chemical recycling capabilities is therefore crucial for advancing a circular plastic economy and reducing environmental impact. Herein, this study reports the synthesis of recyclable acetal thermosets via the polycondensation of a biobased vanillin‐derived aldehyde and diols, utilizing oxalic acid as a catalyst, which can be easily removed during thermal postcuring. The resulting thermosets exhibit excellent mechanical performance, with tensile strengths up to 95 MPa, Young's moduli of ≈3.3 GPa, and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of ≈70 °C. More importantly, the thermosets are efficiently depolymerized under mild acidic conditions into their original monomers, which are easily isolated in high purity, with yields of 72% and 98% for the diol and aldehyde, respectively. These monomers were subsequently reused to synthesize new, identical thermosets, achieving closed‐loop recycling. This research addresses the environmental challenges posed by traditional thermosets, offering a practical solution for sustainable polymer recycling without compromising material performance. The solvent‐free approach further enhances its industrial viability, making a promising step toward a more sustainable strategy for closed‐loop recyclable thermosets.",

    "abstract": "The development of calcium‐ion batteries (CIBs) as potential successors to lithium‐ion batteries has been hindered by the lack of suitable electrolytes. Conventional electrolytes often decompose on the Ca anode, forming calcium‐ion impermeable passivation layers that impede reversible calcium plating and stripping. Therefore, the design of stable electrolytes or those capable of forming Ca2+ permeable passivation layers remains a critical challenge. The present study investigates calcium salts of  (Y = C/Si and X = –BO/OBO) anions using density functional theory (DFT)‐based simulations for CIBs. DFT calculations emphasize the oxidative stability of anions, while ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal their reductive behavior on the Ca anode. Time‐dependent charge transfer analysis and projected density of states provide an atomistic perspective on electron transfer between the Ca surface and anions, aligning with observations from frontier orbital analyses. Decomposition of  (Y = C/Si) anions during AIMD simulation reveals the formation of borate‐based species as part of the solid electrolyte interface, suggesting their potential as electrolytes that enable effective calcium plating and stripping. Overall, this work paves the way for designing efficient electrolytes, offering a fresh perspective to identify optimal CIB electrolytes, and moving beyond ensuring electrolyte stability on the Ca anode.",

However, achieving high selectivity and efficiency under low‐concentration acidic conditions remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu nanosponge can adsorb low concentration nitric acid (HNO3) and efficiently convert it to ammonia (NH3). The Cu nanosponge is prepared by Cl‐‐induced reconstruction of porous Cu nanoparticles obtained through dealloying. In a Cl‐‐containing HNO3 solution, porous Cu nanoparticles undergo chemical oxidation to form CuCl, which reconstructs into a nanosponge through migration and electrochemical reduction, consisting of nanoparticle‐supported nanosheets. The nanosponge features abundant porous structures and numerous nanoparticle‐nanosheet interfaces, creating a large active surface area and providing adsorption and reaction sites for NO3‐. The optimized Cu nanosponge exhibits a 92% FE for NH3 at ‐0.4 V vs. RHE and 90% yield of NH3 in 0.03 M HNO3, significantly outperforming Cu nanoparticle (only 66% and 47%). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms that the nanosponge structure not only enhances NO3‐ adsorption but also stabilizes the key NO2‐ intermediate. Furthermore, we simulate industrial wastewater to convert low concentrations of nitrate into ammonium nitrate products, which are applied to plant cultivation, effectively promoting plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Organic aerogels, known for their lightweight, highly porous structure and ultralow thermal conductivity, have shown great potential in thermal insulation, chemical absorption, and energy storage. However, most aerogels to date pose environmental concerns, as their permanently cross‐linked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. Additionally, the use of toxic solvents in aerogel fabrication raises further environmental and health concerns, challenging their sustainable application. Moreover, the development of next‐generation organic aerogels requires the design of recyclable materials with improved mechanical properties. In response to these challenges, this study demonstrates the synthesis of chemically recyclable polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT) aerogels based on an amide containing aromatic diamine (BABS), utilizing N,N‐dimethyl lactamide (DML), a non‐toxic and label‐free solvent, as gelation medium. Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs) provide key insights into how solvent choice influences the morphology and properties of PHT aerogels. The resulting PHT aerogels exhibited low bulk density (≈ 63 mgcm−3), high porosity (≈ 96%), excellent thermal insulation properties (≈ 17 mWm−1K−1), and enhanced mechanical performance, all while being closed‐loop recyclable. This work highlights the importance of solvent selection in tuning aerogel properties and demonstrates a green route for fabricating sustainable, high‐performance thermal insulating materials.",

In this study, we intended to maintain the active sites and lower the synthesis costs by eliminating the need for heat treatment, leading to the polymerization of cobalt thioamide linkages for a more efficient and durable cobalt thioamide polymer synthesized through a polycondensation. This coordination polymer catalyst was supported on Ketjen Black and exhibited superior OER (Ej10=1.57V) and ORR (E1/2=0.71V) performances. The potential efficiency during long‐term durability of this polymer is examined by performing continuous OER operation for 260h and exhibiting only 5.1% performance decay. For ORR durability, only 39mV is required after 30,000 cycles in accelerated durability tests compared with the initial cycle. This study highlights the potential of cobalt‐coordinated polymer on Ketjen Black as high‐performing and durable alternatives to benchmark catalysts for OER and ORR.",

Conventional heating (CH) methods often require high‐temperature autoclave systems to achieve elevated temperatures and suppress vaporization of the reactant DMC (bp ≈ 90 °C). However, these systems usually entail extended reaction times and significant process cost. It is demonstrated that application of the MW‐assisted reflux technique to the aforementioned transesterification reaction intensifies the energy transfer rate to the reactor by leveraging on the polarity of the reactive mixture and enhances phase transition of the lowest boiling point by‐product (MeOH), thereby achieving 81% EC yield in half the time required under CH reflux conditions to reach only 52% EC yield. Further, compared to CH, MW heating enables 20‐fold lower catalyst loading for comparable EC yields, 9‐fold decrease in energy consumption per mole EC, and 92% reduction in energy consumption during the mixture preheating stage.",

The initial trapped charge population shows a slight decrease after Pt deposition, suggesting that the more reactive and mobile charges are extracted by Pt sites, leaving behind deeply trapped and long‐lived charges.

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes have attracted interest as an antimicrobial material for wound healing and implant-associated infections due to their bactericidal activity without the use of antibiotics. Hydrogels are frequently used as a delivery system; however, most research uses photonic activation in the form of near-infrared (NIR) laser stimulation to cause rapid BP degradation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and a localized photothermal effect. For implant-coating applications, using NIR laser stimulation could be challenging in practice, especially for porous orthopedic implants. This article investigates whether BP nanoflakes, suspended in Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogels, remain effective against Staphylococcus aureus without photonic activation. The experimental results showed 89.4 ± 7.6% bacterial inhibition from BP nanoflakes at a 5120 µg/mL concentration via passive diffusion in F127; however, it could not kill all the bacteria present. It is hypothesized that the F127 gel interface could create a barrier between the bacteria, which continue to multiply in media, and the antimicrobial black phosphorus compound, which degrades in the F127.",

    "abstract": "Metalloporphyrins, owing to their structural resemblance to natural enzyme active sites and highly tunable coordination environments, have emerged as promising catalysts for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation.",

We previously reported a metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of selected Australian Terminalia spp. and highlighted numerous flavonoids that may contribute to the antimicrobial activities of those plants. This study examines the antibacterial activities of fifteen flavonoids found in Terminalia spp. against a range of gastrointestinal pathogens using broth dilution assays. Flavonoids were also combined with six different classes of conventional antibiotics to investigate interactions. The efflux pump inhibitory activity of the flavonoid was evaluated using ethidium bromide accumulation and efflux assays. Toxicities were assessed via human dermal fibroblast cell line assays. Fisetin, hispidulin, isoorientin, orientin, rutin, and vitexin showed noteworthy growth inhibitory activity (MIC values 62.5–250 µg/mL). Isoorientin and orientin were most potent against Bacillus cereus and Alcaligenes faecalis, displaying MIC values of 62.5 µg/mL against both bacteria. All flavonoids except genistein, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, taxifolin, and vitexin were nontoxic in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell proliferation assays. When individual flavonoids were combined with selected antibiotics, some potentiated the activity of these antibiotics. Two synergistic, eighteen additive and thirty-one non-interactive interactions were observed. The synergistic interactions were all observed in combination with orientin. Notably, orientin exhibited efflux pump inhibitory effects at concentrations from 15.26 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL. The findings reported herein indicate that the selected flavonoids have the potential for addressing bacterial antibiotic resistance and highlight the need for further study.",

This study aimed to characterize the phenolic profile of Corallodiscus flabellatus (or C. flabellata) and elucidate its mechanistic interactions with tyrosinase under high-altitude environments with intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Two novel phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and seven known compounds were isolated using silica gel, ODS, and preparative HPLC, with structures determined via NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and acid hydrolysis. Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) inhibition assays revealed divergent effects: compound 7 (containing a caffeoyl moiety) exhibited potent inhibition (IC50 = 0.23 μM), comparable to arbutin, while other PhGs displayed activation or biphasic responses. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compound 7 stabilized tyrosinase via π-π stacking with Phe264 and Cu²⁺ coordination, whereas activating compounds likely acted as substrates. These findings elucidate the dual regulatory function of PhGs, which activate tyrosinase to counteract acute ultraviolet-induced stress and inhibit its activity to attenuate oxidative overload, thereby advancing our understanding of alpine plant adaptation mechanisms.",

An analysis of the absorption spectra of the Dx:Fe3O4 composite reveals the broad absorption bands with maxima at wavelengths of 227 nm, 264 nm, and 340 nm. Dx:Fe3O4 composite nanoparticles in water exhibit strong fluorescence with a quantum yield of 0.24% in contrast to 0.07% for dextran.

Separation was achieved using silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel, and structural elucidation was performed through advanced 1D and 2D NMR techniques, including HSQC, HMBC, and (IN)ADEQUATE. Due to kahweol’s instability, the research prioritized cafestol for the synthesis of rhodamine B conjugates. Initial ester-linked conjugates proved unstable, prompting the development of more robust derivatives through amide linkage strategies and further functionalization via acetylation and oxidation reactions. Some oxidation methods led to furan ring cleavage, impacting structural integrity. Selected compounds were tested for cytotoxicity using SRB assays on human tumor cell lines (MCF7, A2780) and non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). While the parent diterpenes and many derivatives showed minimal activity, several cafestol–rhodamine B conjugates demonstrated notable cytotoxic effects. Compound 6, in particular, exhibited selective activity against cancer cells with reduced toxicity toward non-malignant cells.",

Magnetic studies demonstrate that these complexes exhibit field-induced slow magnetic relaxation behaviors, with positive D values of 25.3(2), 21.6(1), and 19.4(2) cm−1 for 1Cl, 2Br, and 3I, respectively. Detailed analysis of the relaxation dynamics reveals that Raman processes dominate at higher temperatures, with systematic variations in relaxation parameters across the series. The systematic variations in magnetic anisotropy and slow magnetic relaxation behaviors of the three complexes correlate with the decreasing electronegativity of the halide ligands.",

Model solutions were prepared containing four target pollutants (50 mg/L each), Cu (II) at 50 mg/L, and a stoichiometric dose of hydrogen peroxide sufficient for complete oxidation of the organic matter. Chloride levels ranged from low concentrations to those representative of both synthetic and natural seawater (36 g/L NaCl). An increase in chloride concentration consistently led to greater pollutant removal efficiency. The influence of pH on process performance was also assessed in saline and real seawater matrices. An optimal pH range between 6 and 7 was identified in both cases, where the reactivity of copper–chloride complexes was maximized while the formation of insoluble, catalytically inactive copper species was suppressed. Monitoring of pH, soluble copper concentration, and hydrogen peroxide consumption supported the conclusion that real seawater provides the most favorable conditions for copper–chloride catalyzed Fenton-like reactions. These results demonstrate the high potential of copper-based advanced oxidation processes in saline environments, particularly in applications where traditional methods exhibit limited efficiency.",

In this study, the electronic properties of dCor, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-3′-deoxyadenosine (OXOdCor), and 8-hydroxy-3′deoxyadenosie (HOdCor), together with their spin densities, charge distributions, and global reactive descriptors, have been taken into consideration at the M06-2x/6-31++G** level of theory in the aqueous phase. It was found that dCor predominantly adopts a 3′-endo,anti conformation, while OXOdCor and HOdCor adopt a 2′-endo,syn conformation. Also, the keto form of oxidised dCor was found to be energetically preferred to its enolic form. The adiabatic ionisation potentials (AIPs) were noted as follows (in eV): 6.29 for dCor, 6.21 for OXOdCor, and 6.17 for HOdCor. The lowest adiabatic electron affinity among all the discussed adenine nucleosides analogues was assigned for OXOdCor at 1.12 eV. A thorough analysis of the spin density distribution of the adiabatic radical cation reveals that it has a higher accumulation at N6 > C5 > C8 > 3 of dCor, C5 > N6 > N7 > O8 of OXOdCor, and N6 > C5 > C8 > C2 of HOdCor. The results suggest that Cordycepin is more easily converted to OXOdCor and HOdCor than canonical adenine nucleosides. Much like typical drugs, after its administration and release, Cordycepin is exposed to various physiological factors and can be exposed to ionisation radiation during combined therapy. These factors can influence the therapeutic potential of Cordycepin. Therefore, further studies on its stability are of utmost importance.",

    "abstract": "Leukemia is a malignant tumor of the hematopoietic system. Approximately 15% of adult leukemias are chronic myeloid leukemias (CMLs), and this incidence increases annually. The BCR-ABL oncoprotein drives the initiation, promotion, and progression of CML. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first-line therapies for CML, BCR-ABL-mediated drug resistance limits their clinical efficacy and patient prognosis. Perillaldehyde (PAE), a monoterpene and primary volatile oil from perilla, is a promising small-molecule candidate for degrading BCR-ABL and has potential medical applications. The molecular mechanism showed that PAE regulated the expression of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in K562 cells. Confocal laser observation showed that PAE damaged the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced ROS generation. Further evaluations indicated that PAE targeted HSP70 and inactivated the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, thereby inhibiting its downstream proteins. This study may produce a lead compound for CML therapy as PAE may be an effective treatment for further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Although calcium phosphate bone cement has some advantages (it is easy to form, self-curing, and does not produce heat), some disadvantages remain that limit its clinical application. Therefore, the question of how we can modify CPC and further improve the various properties of calcium phosphate bone cement is a current research hotspot. In this paper, the preparation conditions and technology of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) were optimized; chitosan oligosaccharide (COSM) with MW ≤ 3000 Da was added to the optimal formulation of biphasic calcium phosphate cement particles, and its physical and chemical properties were characterized. The results showed that BCP bone cement carrier for clinical operations was successfully constructed by the high-temperature solid-state reaction method, and COSM-BCP bone cement particles were obtained by loading COSM drugs with an angiogenesis effect. Its formula is biphasic calcium phosphate powder with the molar ratio of α-TCP/β-TCP of 1. The curing time of the prepared BCP particles is 24 ± 1 min, the compressive strength is 29.58 ± 1.89 MPa, and the porosity reaches 52.09%. The loaded COSM can be released continuously and stably in vitro, and has the effect of promoting angiogenesis. The safety evaluation of COSM-BCP bone cement particles and the preliminary pharmacodynamic study of its angiogenesis in vitro provide a promising clinical application basis for the development of drug-loaded biological bone substitute materials.",

This study aimed to assess and enhance a QuEChERS-based extraction method coupled with gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for the quantification of pesticide residues in edible insects (bamboo caterpillars, house crickets, silkworm pupae, giant water bugs, and grasshoppers) by combining multiple individual insect specimens into a single, homogenized sample—five replicates were tested. The method was optimized by evaluating various extraction parameters and showed strong linearity for all 47 target pesticides, with correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.9940 to 0.9999. The limits of detection (LODs) varied between 1 and 10 µg/kg, while the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 10 to 15 µg/kg. Recovery studies conducted at three fortification levels (10, 100, and 500 µg/kg) revealed recoveries ranging from 64.54% to 122.12%, that over 97.87% of the pesticides exhibited satisfactory recoveries within the range of 70–120%, and relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 20%, between 1.86% and 6.02%. Matrix effects (%MEs) range from −33.01% to 24.04%, and to those that experienced no effect. More than 94% of the analytes showed minimal ion suppression or enhancement. These results conform to the SANTE guidelines for monitoring pesticide residues in edible insects, enhancing food safety standards and safeguarding consumer protection.",

    "abstract": "Tunnel-structured Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) has been extensively studied as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its favorable cycling endurance, cost-effectiveness, environmental benignity, and notable air-moisture stability. However, limitations, such as sluggish ion diffusion kinetics, an insufficient Na+ storage capacity, and an unsatisfactory Jahn–Teller effect, impede its widespread application. To address these problems, this study proposes a co-doping strategy that involves the simultaneous introduction of a cation and an anion. The optimized cathode Na0.44Mn0.99Ni0.01O1.985F0.015 demonstrates remarkable rate capabilities with average discharge capacities of 136.2, 133.0, 129.6, 124.0, 115.9, and 95.8 mAh g−1 under current rates ranging from 0.1 to 5 C. Furthermore, it also exhibits exceptional long-term cyclability, retaining 86.5% and 89.4% capacity retention at 1 and 5 C after 200 and 400 cycles, respectively, accompanied by nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. A comprehensive structural characterization and experimental analysis reveal that the synergistic incorporation of Ni and F can effectively adjust the lattice parameters and alleviate the Jahn–Teller distortion of the NMO cathode, thereby resulting in enhanced structural integrity, rapid ion transfer dynamics, and excellent sodium storage performance. Consequently, this investigation establishes a significant approach for optimizing tunnel-phase Mn-based cathodes through the synergistic effect of cation and anion co-doping, which promotes the practical implementation of advanced SIBs.",

A Ru-based catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance in ammonia decomposition, and enhancing the interaction between the Ru atoms and the support is an important way to further improve its catalytic activity. In this study, CeO2 was prepared by calcination using a cerium-based metal–organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, and the number of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2 was regulated by hydrogen reduction. The XPS and Raman results showed that abundant oxygen vacancies were formed on the surface of these CeO2, and their number increased with an increase in the reduction time. The Ru/CeO2-4 h catalyst, using CeO2 reduced for 4 h as the support, exhibited good catalytic activity in ammonia decomposition, reaching 98.9% ammonia conversion and 39.74 mmol gcat−1 min−1 hydrogen yield under the condition of GHSV = 36,000 mL gcat−1 h−1 at 500 °C. The XAFS results demonstrated that Ru was stably anchored with oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2 via Ru-O-Ce bonds. Density functional theory calculations further showed that these bondings lower the reaction energy barrier for N-H bond cleavage, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic activity.",

Twelve acrylate monomers with functional groups like amino, halogen, and double-bond were introduced into PDLC films, and twelve samples were prepared. The electro-optical properties and microstructure of the films were characterized. The results show that compared to films with amino and halogen groups, those with hydroxyl groups have the best balance of driving voltage and contrast, achieving higher contrast at lower driving voltage, making this preparation scheme ideal for low-voltage, high-contrast PDLC films. Also, in the presence of hydroxyl groups, introducing double bonds increases saturation voltage and decreases saturation. Hydrogen-bond engineering through strategically positioned hydroxyl groups in acrylate monomers optimizes PDLC performance by enabling compact polymer networks and controlled phase separation, achieving superior contrast ratios (163) and low saturation voltages (15.8 V), while amino groups induce steric limitations and dual-bond systems that disrupt hydrogen-bond efficacy, highlighting hydroxyl spatial design as critical for electro-optical optimization.",

We report here a study on saponin and chitosan at the interface between water and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil in relation to the properties of the corresponding emulsions. Complementary experimental approaches have been adopted to investigate interfacial properties and emulsion evolution, relying on drop tensiometry, optical and confocal microscopy, and light transmission/scattering analysis. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation has been undertaken as support for the interpretation of the experimental results. The multi-technique investigation adopted here enabled a better understanding of saponin adsorption properties and of the role of chitosan in emulsion evolution. In particular, the results evidence the formation of amphiphilic saponin–chitosan complexes, which adsorb at the liquid–liquid interface and improve the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Since the system investigated mainly consists of natural compounds, the results of this work can contribute to the development of new and efficient low-impact formulations.",

The development of new lysosome-imaging-guided AIEgens for the photodynamic therapy of cancer cells is important. In this work, two novel organic compounds with AIE characteristics, namely, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3, were designed and synthesized by introducing the weakly basic morpholinyl moiety with lysosome-targeting ability into a triphenylamine-based luminogen. The distorted spatial feature of TPA and the D1-D2-π-A structure of these AIEgens prevented the aggregation-caused quenching of traditional fluorescent molecules and efficiently promoted the separation of the HOMO and LUMO. The outcomes were AIE features and a narrow single-triplet energy gap. Furthermore, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3 showed bright yellow fluorescence emission peaks at 577 and 601 nm; large Stokes shifts of 234 and 256 nm, respectively; and excellent lysosome-targeted imaging of HeLa cells (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.90). In addition to the good 1O2-generation ability under light irradiation, these AIEgens achieved the high-efficiency bright lysosome imaging-guided photodynamic killing of cancer cells under white-light irradiation.",

Therefore, the search for a new alternative energy technology has become a focus of attention. The long-established Fischer–Tropsch synthesis technology and the recent CO2 hydrogenation technology with unlimited potential seem to be among the ways to solve the above problems. Among them, the development of efficient Fe-based catalysts has become a key issue. Weaker interactions on carbon supports are more favourable for the formation of active phases in Fe-based catalysts than stronger metal–support interactions on conventional oxide supports. In this work, we systematically summarise the application of various types of carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, graphene, activated carbon, etc.) in COx hydrogenation reactions. The effects of different structural types of carriers on the dispersion of active sites are discussed. At the same time, the effects of different carrier preparation methods on catalytic performance are compared. In addition, the role of surface modifications to carbon materials in the promotion of active sites is discussed. Finally, we propose possible research directions based on the current problems in these catalytic systems.

    "abstract": "Indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Previous studies in airway smooth muscle demonstrated that chronic exposure to testosterone (TES, 40 nM) enhances the relaxation induced by salbutamol and theophylline due to K+ channel increment, without modifying cyclooxygenase expression. This study examines how indomethacin, ibuprofen, and ASA affect K+ currents and the relaxation response to these bronchodilators. In organ baths, tracheas from young male guinea pigs chronically (48 h) treated with 40 nM TES showed increased relaxation to salbutamol and theophylline, which was completely abolished by indomethacin. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that TES increased salbutamol- and theophylline-induced K+ currents, and only indomethacin fully inhibited this potentiation; ibuprofen and ASA had partial effects. The involved currents included voltage-dependent K+ (KV) and high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. Our results demonstrate that indomethacin exerts a dual action, inhibiting K+ channel activity and PG synthesis, unlike ibuprofen and ASA. This dual mechanism explains its stronger inhibitory effect on TES-enhanced ASM relaxation. These findings suggest that indomethacin may counteract the protective effects of TES, which promotes anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle-relaxing states. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution when prescribing indomethacin to young males with asthma, as the protective role of TES may diminish, potentially resulting in an exacerbation of asthma symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials (CMs) have gained great attention as heterogeneous catalysts in water treatment because of their high efficiency and potential contribution to achieving carbon neutrality. Expanded graphite (EG) is ideal for studying CMs because the reactivity in CMs largely depends on graphitic structures, and most surface of EG is exposed, minimizing mass transfer resistance. However, EG is poor in adsorption and catalysis. In this study, EG was modified by simple thermal treatment to investigate the effects of characteristics of graphitic structures on reactivity. Tetracycline (TC) removal rate via activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) by the EG treated at 550 °C (EG550) was more than 10 times that of EG. The thermal modification did not significantly increase surfaces but led to increases in damaged, rough surfaces, graphitization degree, C content, defects, and C=O. Radical and non-radical pathways, such as SO4•−, O2•−, 1O2, and electron transfer, were involved in TC removal in EG550+PDS. TC degradation in EG550+PDS was initiated by hydroxylation, followed by demethylation, dehydroxylation, decarbonylation, and ring-opening. The ions ubiquitous in water systems did not significantly affect the performance of EG550+PDS, except for H2PO4− and HCO3−, suggesting the high potential of practical applications. This study demonstrated that graphitic structure itself and surface area are not detrimental in the catalytic reactivity of CMs, which is different from previous studies. Rather, the reactivity is governed by the characteristics, i.e., defects and functional groups of the graphitic structure. It is thought that this study provides valuable insights into the development of highly reactive CMs and the catalytic systems using them.",

The main treatment for cancer is surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Since the outcomes of treatment are unsatisfactory, the search for more effective drugs is crucial. Our previous study indicated that mephedrone, a synthetic cathinone, reduced neuron and astrocyte viability and oligodendrocyte proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of mephedrone on selected human glioblastoma (LN-18, LN-229, T98G) and human anaplastic astrocytoma (MOGGCCM) cell lines. The effects of mephedrone on cell viability and proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression and the type of cell death were studied. Our results showed that mephedrone possesses potential anticancer activity. The viability and proliferation of all four human glioblastoma and human anaplastic astrocytoma cell lines used were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Studies conducted on LN-18 and T98G cells confirmed the significant antiproliferative properties of mephedrone, which reduced DNA synthesis and affected cell cycle progression. Microscopic evaluation supported the antiproliferative effect of the tested compounds. Moreover, substantial cytoplasmic vacuolization in the LN-18 cell line was revealed. This finding may indicate the potential of mephedrone in anticancer therapy.",

In addition, a volumetric display demo incorporating CsPbI3 QDs as light emitters employing triplet fusion upconversion was developed, showing bright luminescent images from CsPbI3 QDs.

    "abstract": "In the natural environment, mechanical energy is widely available as a sustainable and green energy source. In this paper, we successfully convert mechanical energy on ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 tribocatalysts via a friction route. Electrons were transferred across the contact interface when the catalyst particles and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-sealed magnetic bar rubbed against each other under magnetic stirring. At the same time, holes were left on the catalyst while the PTFE absorbed the electrons. Similar to photocatalysis, organic pollutants can be effectively oxidized by the holes in the valence band of sol-gel catalysts due to their strong oxidative ability. The tribocatalytic tests demonstrated that ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 could eliminate organic analgesics (paracetamol) under magnetic stirring in the dark. By controlling the quantity of rare earth elements (1, 2, and 3 mol%), stirring speed, and the number of magnetic rods, we could further enhance the tribocatalytic performance. In addition to developing a green tribocatalysis approach for the oxidative purification of organic pollutants, this work offers a potential route for converting environmental mechanical energy into chemical energy, which could be used in sustainable energy and environmental remediation.",

    "abstract": "With the worsening global water pollution crisis, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments. The effective removal of PPCPs remains challenging for conventional water treatment technologies, whereas photocatalytic technology has shown distinct promise. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a ubiquitous component of aquatic ecosystems, exerts multifaceted effects on the photocatalytic oxidation of PPCPs. In this article, the influence of DOM on the performance of various photocatalysts in PPCP removal is systematically summarized and analyzed. This review highlights DOM’s role in altering the migration and transformation of PPCPs via processes including adsorption and complexation. The adsorption of PPCPs on photocatalysts is achieved by competitive adsorption or by providing more adsorption sites. DOM modifies the structural properties of photocatalysts through mechanisms such as ligand exchange, intermolecular forces, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions. DOM inhibits the formation of active species via light attenuation and shielding effects while simultaneously enhancing their generation through photosensitization and electron transfer facilitation. In this review, the interaction mechanism among DOM, PPCPs, and photocatalysts within the PPCP photocatalytic oxidation system is expounded on. These findings provide novel insights into optimizing photocatalytic reaction conditions and enhancing treatment efficiency, while providing a theoretical foundation for advancing efficient, eco-friendly PPCPs remediation technologies.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanofibrous materials from electrospinning are good candidate electrode materials for supercapacitor applications due to their straightforward processability, chemical stability, high porosity, and large surface area. In this research, a straightforward and effective way was revealed to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon nanofibrous electrode material from electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Fluorination of the electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNF) was studied by comparing two types of hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment, i.e., direct HF acid treatment on ECNF (Type I) vs. HF acid treatment on the stabilized PAN (Type II) followed by carbonization. The latter was found to be an advantageous way to introduce C-F bonds in the resultant carbon nanofibrous electrode material that contributed to pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the Type II HF acid treatment demonstrated exciting synergistic effects with ECNF aerogel formation on carbon structure and porosity development and generated a superior fluorinated electrospun carbon nanofibrous aerogel (ECNA-F) electrode material for supercapacitor uses. The resultant ECNA-F electrode material demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with great cyclic stability due to the large improvements in both pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance. ECNA-F achieved a specific capacitance of 372 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, and the device with ECNA-F and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte possessed an energy density of 29.1 Wh/kg at a power density of 275 W/kg. This study provided insight into developing high-performance and stable carbon nanofibrous electrode materials for supercapacitors.",

We carried out Density Function Theory (DFT)-based calculations to determine the ground state geometry, spin multiplicity, spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals, and electronic structure descriptors to gain insights into the reactivity trends and possible impact on factors influencing electron transport properties. The results suggest that the central metal shapes the spin multiplicity, while variations between sulfur, selenium, and tellurium play a role in charge distribution. This study provides insights into how the selection of the central metal and control of spin channels influence the electronic structure and reactivity of metalloporphyrin molecules.

    "abstract": "A new active composite film intended for bread packaging is described here. The active film has the aim of prolonging bread’s shelf life while avoiding the use of nanoparticles that, with very few exceptions, are a type of material not allowed by regulatory agencies like EFSA (European Food Safety Agency) and FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) in food contact materials. Moreover, the increasing consumer demand for natural and wholesome products, possibly “clean label”, and packaged in natural, non-petroleum-based materials has been taken into consideration. Accordingly, precursor materials from renewable sources were used to prepare the active film: pectin from citrus peel (PEC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were used as the matrix, with oleic acid (OA) as plasticizer. Moreover, the bread preservative calcium propionate (CaP) was used as the crosslinker, and also zeolite microparticles loaded with silver ions (AgZ) were added to the films as an additional antimold agent. This strategy allows us to avoid the addition to bread of the now commonly used preservatives ethanol and calcium propionate, moving the latter to the packaging. Permeance measurements revealed excellent barrier properties against O2 and CO2, while the typical high water vapor permeance of polysaccharide films was mitigated by the non-hydrophilic OA plasticizer. Moreover, the quantities of Ag+ and CaP released in bread are low and below the limits imposed by regulatory agencies. The antimold activity of the films is excellent, with Aspergillus niger, Penicillium janthinellum, and wild-type Penicillim molds reduction on bread in the 99.20–99.95% range for the films containing only CaP and in the 99.97–99.998% range for the films containing both CaP and AgZ. Finally, the rheological properties of the film-forming solutions were investigated, demonstrating their potential application as coatings on natural packaging materials for bread, such as paper.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to prepare a large set of variously substituted 3-aminophthalates starting from substituted 3-acylamino-2H-pyran-2-ones acting as dienes in Diels–Alder reactions with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates having the role of dienophiles. These thermally allowed [4+2] cycloadditions were taking place with normal electron demand due to rather electron-deficient dienophiles and relatively electron-rich dienes; however, they still required quite harsh reaction conditions: heating in closed vessels at 190 °C for up to 17 h was sufficient in most cases (albeit for a few reactions the time needed was up to 58 h) to achieve conversions above 95%. Such conditions, unfortunately, necessitated the use of a larger excess of dienophiles (as undesired polymerization takes place concomitantly); nevertheless, the straightforward isolation procedures enabled access to the target compounds in moderate to high yields (average yield 56%). All products were characterized by standard analytical and spectroscopic methods. With the goal of changing the reaction conditions to be more environmentally friendly, we investigated the effect of various solvents (water, n-butanol, butyl acetate, xylene, para-cymene, n-nonane, etc.) and the temperature applied (130–190 °C) on the conversion. We found that higher temperatures are necessary in most cases (except for the most reactive 2H-pyran-2-ones) regardless of the solvent used. Relative reactivity was determined for both sets of reactants and the experimentally obtained data show good agreement with the computational results.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of hydrolysis on the crystallization behavior of poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA), a biodegradable polyester. Hydrolysis was conducted in a controlled environment using phosphate-buffered saline at 70 °C to isolate the impact of hydrolytic degradation on the polymer’s properties. The consequent changes in molecular weight characteristics were tracked using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), revealing a decrease in both weight average molecular weight (Mw) and an increase in polydispersity index (PDI) as hydrolysis progressed. The thermal behavior of PBSA during hydrolysis was thoroughly investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which demonstrated significant changes in melting temperature (Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg), and crystallinity (X). These changes in Tm and Tg suggest a change in copolymer composition, likely due to the greater susceptibility of the adipic acid unit to hydrolysis compared to the succinic acid unit. Furthermore, polarized optical microscopy (POM) was employed to observe the morphological evolution of PBSA, showing a transition from spherulitic structures in the early stages of hydrolysis to dendritic structures with prolonged hydrolysis time. The decrease in nucleation activity led to a reduction in the number of spherulites, which in turn allowed the remaining spherulites to grow larger.",

This fact determines its frequent use in drug design, including the development of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. These include dorsomorphin which shows compromised kinase selectivity but is still widely used as an AMPK inhibitor. ATP-binding pockets of many proteins have a fairly conservative spatial structure and there is a high probability of obtaining a compound with low target selectivity during drug development. In the case of a common scaffold, the careful selection of side substituents that determine the activity and selectivity of the final compound plays an important role. In this work, a convergent strategy for the synthesis of dorsomorphin and its close analogs was developed and implemented. The resulting small series of compounds is distinguished by the maximum possible diversification and allows for an assessment of the biological activity towards AMPK. An original route to obtain variants of the phenoxy-alkylamine moiety of dorsomorphin via the Mitsunobu reaction will be useful for generating targeted-focused libraries of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors and highly active receptor ligands.",

    "abstract": "Broccoli, a highly valued Brassica vegetable, is renowned for its rich content of bioactive substances, including glucosinolates, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and essential minerals. Glucosinolates (GSLs), secondary plant metabolites, are particularly abundant in broccoli. The global consumption of broccoli has increased due to its high nutritional value. This review examines the essential bioactive compounds in broccoli and their biological properties. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that broccoli exhibits various biological activities, including antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity and antidiabetic effects. This review analyzes several aspects of the chemical and biological activity of GSLs and their hydrolysis products, isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane, as well as phenolic compounds. Particular emphasis is placed on sulforaphane’s chemical structure, the reactivity of its isothiocyanate fraction (-NCS), and given the different behavior of SFN enantiomers, a wide and detailed review of the chemical synthesis methods described, by microbial oxidation, or using a chiral ruthenium catalyst and more widely using chiral auxiliaries for synthesizing sulforaphane enantiomers. In addition, the methods of chiral resolution of racemates by HPLC are reviewed, explaining the different chiral fillers used for this resolution and a third section on resolution using the formation of diastereomeric complexes and subsequent separation on achiral columns. Additionally, this review highlights the presence of antimicrobial peptides in broccoli, which have shown potential applications in food preservation and as natural alternatives to synthetic antibiotics. The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from broccoli target bacterial membranes, enzymes, oxidative stress pathways and inflammatory mediators, contributing to their effectiveness against a wide range of pathogens and with potential therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "As the proportion of the elderly population increases, there is an urgent need for anti-aging technologies. Since the skin is the most visibly aging organ in the human body, it is crucial to develop active ingredients to slow down skin aging. Currently, identified anti-aging active substances include antioxidants, retinoids, peptides, growth factors, and compounds derived from biofermentation. However, they have limitations such as poor stability, low transdermal permeability, skin irritation, high effective concentrations, slow onset of efficacy, single-action mechanisms, and high production costs. These limitations highlight the necessity of developing new anti-aging technologies that are multifunctional and cause low irritation. This study aimed to investigate the anti-aging effects and mechanisms of fructosazine (FZ) and deoxyfructosazine (DOF) on the skin as well as their potential applications in skincare. The methods included ELISA tests to assess the viability of human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells and related factors, and monitoring in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The results showed that FZ promoted cell viability. Both FZ and DOF enhanced the secretion of type I collagen (Col I) and hyaluronic acid (HA), inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), boosted catalase (CAT), and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and β-galactosidase. They also nourished the epidermis and increased fiber content. In conclusion, FZ and DOF can stimulate the production of anti-aging substances, exhibit antioxidant activity, and have potential in skincare.",

This paper investigated the chemical composition and antibacterial activities as well as the antibiofilm and antioxidant activities of the essential oil (EO) obtained from the pre-flowering aerial parts of Lavandula pedunculata subsp. atlantica collected in Morocco. The chemical composition of the EO, obtained by classic hydrodistillation, showed by GC-MS analysis the presence of a large amount of oxygenated monoterpene compounds. The main constituents of the EO were camphor (27.8%), camphene (10.9%), fenchone (10.6%), and eucalyptol (8.5%). The EO has been evaluated for its antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showing promising activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. These findings highlight the potential of Lavandula EO in combating infections caused by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus oralis (oral diseases), Staphylococcus aureus (skin infections), Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei (gastrointestinal and urinary infections). In addition, although the EO showed no evident effects on cell viability in eukaryotic epithelial cells, it exhibited promising effects on anti-inflammatory properties.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent chronic degenerative joint disorder marked by cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation. Despite its widespread occurrence, effective pharmacological interventions to halt or reverse OA progression remain elusive. Thus, an in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis is imperative for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Methods: Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, weighing 180–220 g) were randomly assigned to two groups: the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) group and the sham-operated group. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the subchondral bone at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after ACLT. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was used to elucidate metabolic changes and the underlying mechanisms in osteoblasts. Results: A total of 26 metabolites were identified from the NMR spectra of osteoblasts. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in the ACLT group at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. In particular, several differential metabolites were identified, including glucose, lactate, NADP+, phosphocreatine, and alanine, as well as eight perturbed pathways, such as alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and taurine metabolism. Conclusions: Key energy-related metabolites, including glucose, lactate, creatine phosphate, and creatine, were identified as key markers of osteoblast dysfunction in OA, underscoring the profound metabolic perturbations induced by ACL injury. These disturbances in energy homeostasis are strongly implicated in the progression of OA. In addition, branched-chain amino acids emerged as potential biomarkers, further highlighting the metabolic dysregulation associated with the disease. Taken together, the metabolic changes observed in rat osteoblasts following ACL injury reveal a complex interplay between energy and amino acid metabolism, providing critical insights into the pathogenesis of post-traumatic OA and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily defined by the deterioration of motor function and characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Although it is the second most prevalent disorder of the central nervous system, current treatments primarily focus on symptom management and modestly slowing disease progression, ultimately failing to preserve the long-term quality of life of a substantial proportion of affected individuals. Innovative therapies that can restore neuronal function have emerged, such as the use of the secretome of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) due to their rich composition of bioactive molecules. This therapy exhibits robust paracrine activity that drives most of the self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential, and immune regulation of MSCs without presenting compatibility issues often associated with stem cell-based therapies. While conceptually appealing, the clinical application of this approach is still limited by the availability and proliferation capacity of MSCs, as it impacts not only secretome production but also its quality. Various protocols have been developed to enhance secretome action by adding various compounds to cell culture media, given the high environmental plasticity of MSCs. Some of the compounds already used are Caloric Restriction Mimetics (CRMs), molecules that mimic Caloric Restriction (CR) conditions, which have been demonstrated to extend lifespan and reduce age-related diseases in various organisms. While not sufficient to cure neurodegenerative disorders, these compounds may potentiate secretome efficiency by enhancing autophagy pathways and relieving oxidative stress burden from MSCs. Therefore, in this article, we aim to explore the effects of CRMs priming on MSCs and how it may help bridge existing gaps in regenerative therapies for PD.",

SOD1 mutations have a significant role in the pathophysiology and fast behavior of protopathic proteins in ALS illness. The E100K mutation may be useful in uncovering the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1 associated with ALS. According to several studies, giving small molecule inhibitors made from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds may be a viable treatment strategy for neurological conditions. Using molecular docking and MD simulations, we have identified a potential flavonoid drug that may successfully inhibit SOD1’s amyloidogenic activity. Puerarin, Fisetin, and Peonidin provided intriguing pharmacological hints during the initial screening of flavonoids. The Fisetin-E100K complex had a larger residual energy contribution and substantial binding than other flavonoid compounds. The findings showed that, unlike other materials, Fisetin increased the structural stability, hydrophobicity, and flexibility of the mutant while reducing the amount of β-sheets. Furthermore, to distinguish aggregation in the mutant (unbound/bound) states, we displayed modifications in the free energy landscape (FEL). As a result, Fisetin was identified as having therapeutic potential against the E100K, which might make it a viable pharmacological option for the creation of inhibitors that lower the chance of ALS death.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBeing a complex neurodegenerative disease with many clinical features, Alzheimer’s disease calls for multiple-targeted drugs to treat several aspects of its progression in the human body. The present study sheds light on evaluating and designing novel pyrazole and benzofuran-based derivatives as potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors with improved antioxidant features to manage Alzheimer’s disease.MaterialsVarious molecular interaction fields, specifically steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, acceptor, and donor fields of hydrogen bonds, were examined using 3D-QSAR models to predict inhibitory activity against the AChE enzyme, which was successfully validated through both external and internal assessments.Results and discussionConsequently, the CoMFA and CoMSIA/ SEHDA models led to the design of the candidate compound C27** as one of the most potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors while building on the most active molecule (C7). Both C27** and C7 revealed their significant chemical reactivity after their optimization with B3LYP 6-31G (d, p) using the density functional theory (DFT), in addition to large similarities to the candidate drugs with desired pharmacokinetic and physicochemical features and good levels of molecular stability towards the crystal structure of human acetylcholinesterase protein (PDB ID of 4EY7).",

The parasitological, biochemical, and immunological activities of the compounds were measured. The screened compounds were subjected to molecular docking in the active site of CpCDPK1, in addition to analyses based on Lipinski’s rule and SwissADME. The results showed that compounds 5a, 5b, and 7b demonstrated promising antiparasitic activity, characterized by high gastrointestinal absorption and favorable drug-likeness profiles. Furthermore, 5a and 7b exhibited higher binding affinities than that of the reference drug. In practical assessments, compound 7b exhibited the highest percentage reduction in oocyst counts (67%).

This study reports for the first time the implementation of the microbial dye violacein, obtained by Janthinobacterium lividum batch cultivation, as SERS probe, as a suitable substitutive to the most employed toxic chemical dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). The interaction of the proposed natural probe with the metal surface after the adsorption and the presence of local electromagnetic fields were evaluated by computational approach. The SERS devices developed were decorated by applying a single-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) decoration method and characterized using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The platform showed a remarkable sensitivity, achieving a detection limit of 10–7 M for violacein, allowing to point out the strong potential of this natural microbial dye as a sustainable probe molecule for low-concentration analytes detection on SERS-active substrates, making them suitable for several application fields, such as environmental monitoring, food safety, cultural heritage analysis and diagnostics.

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation plays a pivotal role in human semen, influencing various processes, such as spermatogenesis, maturation, sperm motility, capacitation, and fertilization. Despite its importance, the specific details regarding N/O-glycosylation within human semen proteins have largely remained unknown. To address this challenge, an integrated glycoproteomic platform (termed GlycoIP) was developed, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both intact N- and O-glycopeptides directly from human semen samples. Characterizing these intact glycopeptides is particularly challenging, yet it provides invaluable insights into the structure and function of both glycans and their attachment sites. In this study, our platform enabled the identification of 1,833 unique N-glycopeptides and 720 unique O-glycopeptides. This approach revealed extensive and precise site-specific N/O-glycosylation data, highlighting 438 potential O-glycosylation sites from 148 distinct O-glycoproteins. Notably, we conducted site-specific N/O-glycosylation profiling on several unique glycoproteins, including sperm equatorial segment protein 1 (SPESP1), which is located on human sperm, and plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), which is presented in both sperm and seminal plasma. In summary, this platform provides a promising approach for comprehensive profiling of protein site-specific N/O-glycosylation within a single experiment. This advancement paves the way for further functional studies on glycoproteins and their roles in male infertility, enhancing our understanding of this complex field.",

This study aimed to optimize the therapeutic potential of brevinin-1pl, a frog-derived AMP with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities.MethodsMajor experimental approaches encompassed antibacterial activity evaluation, hemolytic potential assessment, bactericidal rate determination via time-kill kinetics, SYTOX Green-based membrane integrity analysis, and MTT assays for anti-proliferative effects.ResultsSubstitutions with arginine (brevinin-1pl-2R and brevinin-1pl-5R) enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria but reduced efficacy against Gram-negative strains. Lysine substitution (brevinin-1pl-6K) decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria due to reduced hydrophobicity. In contrast, histidine substitution (brevinin-1pl-3H) showed diminished activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., MRSA MIC increased from 2 µM to 4 µM) but reduced hemolysis, indicating improved selectivity. Mechanistic studies using SYTOX green assays confirmed membrane disruption as a primary mode of action, while suggesting alternative mechanisms for Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The brevinin-1pl and its analogues demonstrated significant inhibitory efficacy against both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and H838 non-small cell lung cancer cells at a concentration of 10–4 M. Notably, brevinin-1pl-3H exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal HaCaT cells despite its high hydrophobicity, suggesting potential for dermatological applications.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that strategic amino acid substitutions can optimize the therapeutic potential of AMPs, offering a promising approach to develop peptides with enhanced efficacy and reduced clinical side effects.",

Meanwhile, its microscopic properties were tested by industrial analysis, mercury pressure method and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method.ResultsFirstly, non-focusing microwaves achieve more stable gasification despite comparable gas production durations. Secondly, focused microwaves enhance energy absorption and reduce coal moisture, while non-focusing radiation alters coal composition by increasing volatile matter and decreasing fixed carbon. Finally, non-focusing modes improve coal combustibility and reduce particulate emissions with minimal environmental impact, contrasting with focused microwaves limited ecological effects. Both methods similarly reduce coal porosity and pore volume.DiscussionThis work compares gasification performance and physicochemical changes under both modalities, revealing three critical differences.

We have used two types of oxide nanoparticles, namely, Al2O3 and γ- Al2O3, with water and C2H6O2. The purpose of this study is to investigate an innovative comparative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid flow and heat transport with the impact of thermal radiation on water and ethylene glycol (EG) suspended with Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. A novel comparison of concentration of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ Al2O3–C2H6O2 nanofluids is investigated under the influence of chemical reactions. The system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was obtained via a similarity transformation and then solved using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) in Mathematica. The temperature and velocity profiles are obtained numerically for a range of controlling parameter values, including the volume percentage φ of nanomaterials, the magnetic effect parameter M, the radiation parameter Rd, and Eckert number Ec in convergent/divergent channels. The concentration profiles of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 tri-nanofluids are calculated numerically for governing parameter values, including those accounting for chemical reactions. The investigation’s findings indicate that there is greater heat transport in γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 and γ-Al2O3–H2O than in Al2O3–H2O. We have demonstrated that there is good agreement between the current results and those found in the literature for various values of the magnetic field parameter, thermal radiation parameter, and nanoparticle volume fraction.",

With the growing emphasis on green chemistry principles, the pursuit of environmentally benign trifluoromethylation strategies has emerged as a critical research frontier. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), characterized by its cost-effectiveness, stability, and low toxicity, has become a promising alternative to conventional trifluoromethylation reagents. This review systematically summarizes advancements in photocatalytic decarboxylative trifluoromethylation using TFA and its derivatives over the past decade, focusing on three key activation mechanisms: single-electron transfer (SET), electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-mediated pathways, and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This paradigm shift is driven by the intrinsic limitations of conventional thermal decarboxylation, particularly its reliance on harsh conditions and significant environmental burdens. In contrast, photocatalytic strategies enable efficient C–CF3 bond construction under mild conditions, offering a modular platform for synthesizing fluorinated functional molecules. Strategic research priorities should focus on overcoming fundamental challenges, including but not limited to optimizing photosensitizer catalytic efficiency, establishing regioselective manipulation strategies, and engineering multicomponent tandem reaction systems to achieve trifluoromethylation methodologies under mild conditions. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic investigations with artificial intelligence-driven reaction prediction will accelerate the advancement of precision trifluoromethylation technologies. This progress is anticipated to provide sustainable synthetic solutions for next-generation fluorinated pharmaceuticals and advanced functional materials, effectively bridging the innovation gap between academic research and industrial implementation.",

Although tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has emerged as a promising photoanode material, its performance is far below the theoretical limit. Among several photoelectrode design strategies, interfacial modification can be beneficial for suppressing interfacial charge recombination and promoting charge transfer process, which is a key focus in recent research. In the review, a brief overview of recent advances in interfacial modification strategies for Ta3N5 photoanodes and their influence on the structure-performance relationship are summarized, aiming at an in-depth understanding of the charge-transfer mechanism during PEC water oxidation, and providing insights into designing efficient and stable Ta3N5 photoanodes for solar-to-fuel conversion through photoelectrocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "Today, wastewater treatment is essential and inevitable due to the water crisis caused by climate change and population growth. Although numerous methods and synthetic compounds have been successful in practical and laboratory applications, developing novel multifunctional compounds remains of interest to scientists. For this purpose, a new nanofiber containing Cobalt-MOF (metal-organic framework), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which are known environmentally friendly polymers, was synthesized. After characterization and structure determination, the nanofiber was investigated for its ability to adsorb Congo Red dye and inhibit known microbial species in wastewater. This study showed that 91% of the 400 mg/L Congo red solution was absorbed by 0.06 g/L of the synthesized Cobalt-MOF/PVA-PVP Nanofibers at 1 h. Additionally, seven well-known strains (including Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Giardia lamblia) in wastewater were inhibited (with MIC of 8 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL) to the extent that some antibiotics could not affect them. This performance of the newly synthesized nanofiber can be attributed to its physical, chemical, and structural characteristics, such as compounds with biological properties present in its structure, as well as its high specific surface area. Therefore, researching and synthesizing similar compounds using the method presented in this study can lead to their development and application in wastewater treatment processes.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly efficient, recyclable adsorbents for heavy metal remediation remains a critical challenge in environmental engineering. This study introduces a novel cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized magnesium silicate (CTAB/MS) nano-adsorbent was synthesized through a multi-step surface modification of serpentinite involving intercalation with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol treatment, and CTAB incorporation. The resulting nanostructure was extensively characterized and applied for the removal of cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), and copper (Cu2+) ions from contaminated water. The characterization findings confirmed significant morphological and structural modifications, including enhanced surface area, functional group availability, and mesoporosity, which contributed to enhanced adsorption performance. The kinetic modeling confirmed that the process predominantly followed a pseudo-first-order model, suggesting that rapid physisorption mechanisms controlled the initial adsorption phase. Equilibrium studies revealed that adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous active sites, with maximum adsorption capacities of 491.9 mg/g (Cd2+), 481.8 mg/g (Co2+), and 434.3 mg/g (Cu2+) at 303 K. Furthermore, statistical physics-based isotherm model incorporating steric and energetic parameters provided deeper mechanistic insights. The adsorption energy (ΔE) values remained below 12.66 kJ/mol, confirming a predominantly physical adsorption process, while thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic and spontaneous nature, as evidenced by negative free enthalpy (G) and internal energy (Eint) values. The recyclability assessment demonstrated that CTAB/MS retained over 70% of its adsorption efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles, underscoring its long-term applicability in water treatment. This highlights the potential of CTAB/MS as an advanced, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for large-scale water purification.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAstragali Radix (AR) - Curcumae Rhizoma (vinegar processed, CR) herb pair was recorded in ‘YIXUE ZHONGZHONG CANXILU’ to treat colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Hedysari Radix (HR) was categorized under the AR entry in ‘SHENNONG BENCAO JING’. HR is still an alternative to AR paired with CR clinically in northwest China. Hedysari Radix Praeparata Cum Melle (HRPCM) is a product that HR fries with honey to enhance the therapeutic effect. However, the mechanism of HRPCM paired with CR (HRCR) in CAC needs to be further elucidated.MethodsHRCR-MIAS were prepared using the eversion intestinal sac method. UHPLC Q-Exactive-MS investigated the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. Then, the mechanism of HRCR in CAC mice was predicted based on network pharmacology analysis in combination with the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. The pharmacodynamic effects of HRCR-MIAS for SW620 colon cancer cells were invested in vitro. The efficacies of HRCR low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (HRCR-L, 3.413 g/kg; HRCR-M, 6.825 g/kg; HRCR-H, 13.650 g/kg) in CAC mice were explored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to assay The inflammatory factors levels, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum. The expressions of the intestinal permeability proteins, such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1, were detected via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Finally, the predicted signalling was verified by Western blot (WB).Results855 common components were identified in HRCR and HRCR-MIAS, and 25 specific components in HRCR-MIAS were pointed out. Based on network pharmacology analysis, the inflammatory response and the cross-linked MAPK signalling and NF-kB signalling were predicted to be the main reasons for HRCR in CAC. HRCR-MIAS inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, regulated the cell cycle progression, and restrained the SW620 cells’ ability to migrate and invade in vitro. The outcomes of the WB experiment exhibited that HRCR-MIAS inhibited the expression of key proteins such as MEKK1, RAS, ERK, IKB and NF-kB in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling pathway of SW620 cells. The study in vivo found that the different doses of HRCR recovered the loss of body weight, the shortened colon length, the increased tumour counts, the abnormal changes in spleen and thymus indices, the colonic lesions, the unbalanced inflammatory factors levels like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, and the down-regulated intestinal permeability proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Experimental validation by WB confirmed that HRCR inhibited the expression of the key proteins, including MEKK1 RAS, ERK, IKB, and NF-kB, in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling in CAC mice.DiscussionHRCR not only suppresses the process of colonic inflammation and improves intestinal permeability but also relieves CAC by inhibiting the activated MAPK/NF-kB signalling cascade to alleviate CAC.",

Pharmaceutical researchers are diligently striving to identify avariety of drugs that might effectively cure pneumonia.MethodWe are motivated to examine the quantitative structureproperty relationships (QSPR) of anti-pneumonia pharmaceuticals. We employed K-Banhatti topological descriptors and analyzed the findings to achieve this. For estimation of physicochemical properties of pneumonia treatment drugs we utilized linear, quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic regression analyses.Results and ConclusionThe drugs comprise linezolid, ceftabiprole, and clarithromycin, among others. Topological descriptors enable the exploration of the complexity, connectivity, and other essential attributes of molecules. The quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis of pharmaceuticals for illness treatment employing K-Banhatti topological descriptors is an economical approach utilised by pharmaceutical researchers. We performed a QSPR analysis on 20 anti-pneumonia drugs to ascertain the most precise predictions for five properties: enthalpy, flash point, molecular weight, molar volume, and molar refractivity, employing five K-Banhatti indices. To do this, we used linear, quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic regression analyses to find links between molecules and the physical and chemical properties of drugs used to treat pneumonia. Employing molecular descriptors and regression models to investigate chemical patterns is a cost-effective and theoretical methodology.",

Wang), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is extensively used as an ingredient in herbal teas and is a well-known folk medicine in China. However, two common adulterants, Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. and Hedyotis tenelliflora (BL.) Kuntze, belonging to the same family, are frequently mistaken as S. diffusum in folk medicine. This confusion has led to a growing concern about their identification and quality evaluation. While previous studies have demonstrated over 15 various compounds as potential chemical markers for authentication and quality control for S. diffusum, considering the selection criteria for chemical markers in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, most of these compounds do not meet the pharmacopoeial requirements. Hence, this study aims to identify an appropriate chemical marker for S. diffusum based on thin layer chromatography (TLC) identification and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quality control, in order to differentiate from any counterfeits such as H. corymbosa and H. tenelliflora. Our findings suggested for the first time that the compound (E)-6-O-(p-coumaroyl) scandoside methyl ester which is specific to S. diffusum, could serve as the chemical marker. Here, attempt was made to establish standardized protocols for TLC identification, HPLC analysis, and quantitative methodologies, adhering to Chinese pharmacopoeial standards, along with laboratory scale preparation procedures. In conclusion, our findings have provided valuable insights to the identification and quality control processes for S. diffusum, and anticipated with potential applications by the industry and regulatory authority.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are natural organic compounds that are derivatives of diphenylpropane. This group of polyphenols can be found in multiple natural sources and they exhibit a variety of biological effects. Despite the wide array of beneficial properties, the development of drugs based on these compounds is hindered by their low bioavailability. Although the substantial body of information available on strategies to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of flavonoids, this knowledge remains fragmented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to consolidate and systematize scientific data on methods for increasing the solubility and bioavailability of flavonoid compounds without changing their initial molecular structures. Throughout the investigation, it was determined that the most prevalent methods for increasing solubility and bioavailability include co-crystallization, formation of phospholipid and inclusion complexes, and the creation of nanostructures. Although there were no pronounced differences observed in enhancing solubility, the impact of these methods on pharmacokinetic parameters was established. It was found that the production of inclusion complexes and nanostructures leads to the greatest increase in the area under the pharmacokinetic curve by an average of 4.2 and 3.7 times, respectively. The least effect was noted for phytosomes, where this parameter for the modified forms exceeded the initial value by only 1.7 times. Phospholipid complexes exhibited a longer average half-elimination time than all other modifications, achieving a 2.1-fold increase. For nanostructures and micelles, a substantial increase in maximum concentration of the active substance in blood plasma was observed, reaching an average of 5.4 times for both types of modifications. During the systematization and generalization of the data, a high level of heterogeneity in solubility assessment methods across various studies was revealed, complicating comparisons of original data obtained by different researchers. The findings of this review are crucial for researchers investigating the bioavailability of flavonoid compounds and will facilitate the selection of the most effective methods based on the desired outcomes for solubility and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe similarity in appearance of poisonous and medicinal plants, such as Asarum heterotropoides (AH) and Cynanchum paniculatum (CP), poses safety risks due to frequent confusion. Since AH contains toxic ingredients, the traditional methods of olfactory and gustatory identification cannot be used to distinguish AH from CP.MethodsTo differentiate them systematically, we proposed a novel strategy based on dual electronic sensors (DES) and dual fingerprint spectra (DFS). The DES included two intelligent sensors, namely the E-nose and E-tongue, which differentiated AH and CP based on odor and taste, respectively. DFS comprised chemical fingerprint spectra obtained through LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS and electrochemical fingerprint spectra derived from the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, differentiating AH and CP by their specific and overall compositions, respectively. To our knowledge, this was the first time that the E-nose, E-tongue, LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS, and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction were combined to identify AH and CP.Results and discussion With the E-nose, we identified 25 major odor components in AH and 12 odor components in CP in a single run of 140 s. Using the E-tongue, bitterness and astringency were identified as their primary taste differences. Furthermore, 91 compounds in AH and 90 compounds in CP were identified through LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Both AH and CP shared nitrogenous compounds, volatile oils, organic acids, and lignans. However, AH uniquely contained coumarins and flavonoids, while CP contained steroidal compounds and saccharides. Notably, AH also possessed distinct toxic components, specifically aristolactam I, aristolochic acid D, and safrole. Based on the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, we obtained the electrochemical fingerprint spectra of AH and CP, thereby facilitating further distinction between these two herbs. Through the combination of electrochemical fingerprint spectra with principal component analysis (PCA) or orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), the accuracy of this method reached 100%. Through the fusion strategy, the odors, tastes, components, and electrochemical properties of AH and CP have been systematically analyzed.",

As a type of biosensor, the glucose oxidase electrode exhibits advantages such as ease of operation, high sensitivity, and strong specificity, promising broad application prospects in biomedical science, the food industry, and other fields. In recent years, with the advancement of nanotechnology, research efforts to enhance the performance of GOx biosensors have primarily focused on improving the conductive properties and specific surface area of nanomaterials, while neglecting the potential to modify the structure of the core component, GOx itself, to improve biosensor performance. Rapid modification of the GOx surface through chemical modification techniques yields a new modified enzyme (mGOx). Meanwhile, composite techniques involving carbon nanomaterials can be employed to further enhance sensor performance.

    "abstract": "TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized on mortar spheres and subsequently packed into a tubular reactor equipped with a concentrical submergible UV lamp for photocatalytic decolorization of aniline blue solution. The microstructure and chemical composition of TiO2 layer on the spheres, the efficiency for aniline decolorization, and the durability of the TiO2 coating were studied. In this work, the mean thickness of the TiO2 layer was 4.01 ± 0.55 µm, while the mean mass loading on the substrate was 5.6 ± 0.61 mg/cm2. Then, the photocatalytic reactor showed excellent performance for dye removal, reaching levels between 95%–97% in 150 min under UV light. Moreover, by radical scavenging experiments, h+, O2.-, and ⋅OH were identified as the main reactive species. Even after twenty consecutive cycles, the removal efficiencies were higher than 83% and the decrease of efficiency was related to the partial detachment of the TiO2 layer (mean thickness decreased to 2.17 µm) which was verified by FESEM-EDX and metallographic microscopy. Finally, based on results, it is worth noting that the effective immobilization of TiO2 photocatalyst on the mortar spheres as substrate facilitates catalyst recovery, improves recyclability, and enables continuous water treatment. Therefore, this technology is a promising option for the removal of dyes in water, we even suggest that the proposed photocatalytic reactor could be scaled up for the treatment of effluents from textile industries, contributing to the abatement of water pollution.",

One of the most important features of these materials and using the electrospinning technique, is the incorporation of compounds and metals into their structure. In this study, a new metal-organic framework (MOF) was synthesized from rhodium, a metal with significant biological potential, which was then used to produce new nanofibers using electrospinning technique, (Rh-MOF/PVA-PVP nanofiber) by mixing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The newly synthesized nanofiber was tested against common microbial skin pathogens and cancer cells, showing significant inhibition. Specifically, an IC50 value of 19.45 μg/mL against cancer cells and MIC values ranging from 4 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL μg against skin pathogenic strains were observed. This notable inhibitory ability can be attributed to both physical characteristics (with specific surface area of 2,348 m2/g), and chemical factors, including the active compounds present in its rhodium (Rh) structure.

    "abstract": "IntroductionRivaroxaban is an anticoagulant medication that targets a key stage in the blood clotting process, preventing the formation and growth of clots. It is commonly used to prevent thrombosis or inhibit the enlargement of existing clots. Rivaroxaban functions as a Factor Xa inhibitor and is indicated for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as reducing the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, and prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery.MethodsA robust, precise, and selective reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated for analyzing Rivaroxaban in raw materials. Isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was performed using a Thermo ODS Hypersil C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm) at ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of monobasic potassium phosphate at pH 2.9 and acetonitrile in a 70:30 (v/v) ratio, with UV detection at 249 nm.ResultsLinearity was established in the concentration range of 50–1,000 ppm (R2 = 0.999), and the retention time for Rivaroxaban was approximately 12 min. The percentage relative standard deviation (RSD) for precision and accuracy was consistently below 2.0%, ensuring method reliability. Solution stability studies confirmed the stability of Rivaroxaban over the analysis period, as no peak loss, degradation, or additional peaks were observed between the first and last injections. Furthermore, forced degradation studies were conducted under various stress conditions, including acid and base hydrolysis, as well as hydrogen peroxide oxidation. The method successfully resolved Rivaroxaban from its degradation products, demonstrating its stability-indicating capability.ConclusionRivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant that selectively and directly inhibits factor Xa. A method has been developed and validated for its analysis, adhering to guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). The validation process assessed parameters such as specificity, robustness, linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ). The LOD for impurities and degradants was determined to be 0.3 ppm, while the LOQ was 1 ppm. This stability-indicating method is highly suitable for routine quality control and analytical applications in both raw materials and finished drug products, owing to its simplicity, efficiency, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWith the growing global concern over CO2 emissions, reducing CO2 output has become an urgent requirement. The iron production industry is among those with the highest CO2 emissions, primarily due to the use of coke as a reductant and the use of a heat source at approximately 2,000°C. To address this issue, various alternative reductants, including CO, H2, and lignite, have been explored. Building on these efforts, we recently reported a novel ironmaking system using oxalic acid (HOOC–COOH) as the reductant. Formate salts, hydrogenated forms of CO2, are promising precursors for oxalate salts; however, their behavior during dimerization remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigate the influence of group 1 and 2 metal cations on the base-promoted dehydrogenative coupling of formate to form oxalate.MethodsFirst, dehydrogenative coupling of sodium formate was executed by using various types of groups 1 and 2 metal carbonates. Second, the base was replaced from metal carbonates to metal hydroxides to check the reactivity. Finally, a countercation of sodium formate was replaced to various types of groups 1 and 2 metals. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, DFT calculation was executed.Results and discussionTreatment of sodium formate with various bases (group 1 and 2 metal carbonates or hydroxides) revealed that group 1 metal hydroxides are more effective than metal carbonates for oxalate formation, with cesium hydroxide (CsOH) exhibiting high reactivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that this kinetic advantage arises not only from increased basicity but also from intermediate destabilization in the Na/Cs mixed-cation system. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that oxalate yield is influenced by the thermodynamic stability of intermediates and products (oxalate salts), highlighting the crucial role of cations in the reaction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the toxicity characteristics and mechanisms of quinacrine acetate, a small molecule modulator of the cGAS-STING-TBK1 signaling pathway, and to establish and validate the application value of network toxicology analysis strategy.MethodsProTox and ADMETlab platforms were used to evaluate the toxic effects of quinacrine acetate on human tissues and organs. Potential targets associated with quinacrine acetate toxicity were identified through ChEMBL, STITCH, GeneCards, OMIM, and TD databases. GO and KEGG analyses were employed to elucidate related functions and molecular mechanisms. STRING and Cytoscape software were utilized to identify key hub genes, while molecular docking validation was performed using the CB-Dock2 database. Based on toxicity analysis results, COPD was selected as a disease model, and GEO database was used to analyze the expression characteristics, immune correlation, and drug target value of hub genes in COPD.ResultsProTox and ADMETlab analyses revealed that quinacrine acetate exhibited significant toxicity to the respiratory system (toxicity level 4, risk coefficient 0.959). Through integrated multi-database analysis, 14 potential targets related to quinacrine acetate-induced respiratory system toxicity were identified. GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that quinacrine acetate-induced respiratory toxicity was primarily mediated through metabolic pathways. Network analysis via STRING and Cytoscape identified AKT1, PLA2G4A, and ALOX5 as three core targets. Molecular docking results confirmed strong binding affinity between quinacrine acetate and these core targets. In COPD patients, PLA2G4A and ALOX5 showed significantly upregulated expression, with hub gene ROC curve AUC value reaching 0.829, demonstrating good diagnostic value. Further immune correlation analysis revealed that ALOX5 and PLA2G4A were closely associated with various immune cell expressions and served as targets for multiple drugs including histamine, melittin, and formic acid.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that quinacrine acetate may influence the progression and risk of respiratory system diseases by regulating metabolic pathways. The findings provide not only a theoretical foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of quinacrine acetate-induced respiratory toxicity but also new perspectives and methodological references for evaluating the toxic effects of small molecule compounds in respiratory diseases. Therefore, we demonstrates the practical application value of network toxicology as an efficient predictive tool for identifying potential toxicity targets and pathways, which can guide subsequent experimental validation and provide mechanistic insights that traditional toxicology approaches might miss.",

Further investigations of this kind can lead to the development of targeted synthesis protocols and tailoring of their structure-related physical properties. In this work, the structural evolution during the synthesis of the luminescent [Tb (bipy)2(NO3)3] (bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine) complex is studied by monitoring the ligand-to-metal energy transfer through in situ luminescence measurements combined with synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. These experiments reveal an interesting crystallization pathway involving the formation of a reaction intermediate that is dependent on parameters such as ligand-to-metal molar ratios. In addition, the structure of [Tb (bipy)2(NO3)3] is solved from serial crystallography data collected at a microfocused synchrotron X-ray beamline. This is an emerging technique that can be used to interrogate individual crystallites and overcome beam damage effects. The resulting structure is found to correspond to that determined by classical single crystal XRD, and a perspective on realizing future in situ measurements of this type is given. This work therefore describes multiple advancements combining crystallite-specific diffraction probes and in situ techniques to track the synthesis kinetics of luminescent materials.",

Green synthesis approaches offer a promising alternative due to their simplicity, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. In this study, we report the biosynthesis of TiO2NPs using Morus alba leaf extract and their subsequent incorporation into a gellan gum (GG) biopolymer to create a hydrogel. The physicochemical properties of the biosynthesized TiO2NPs and the TiO2NP@GG hydrogel were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the bioactivity of the materials was investigated through antibacterial assays against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, as well as in vitro wound healing studies using a 3T3 fibroblast scratch assay. XRD analysis confirmed the successful formation of anatase phase TiO2. SEM images revealed the presence of irregular and rod-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles, with EDS analysis confirming their composition of oxygen and titanium. The particle size was determined to be 80–90 nm, and the nanoparticles exhibited homogeneous distribution throughout the gellan gum biopolymer network. The TiO2NP@GG hydrogel displayed significant antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli. In vitro wound healing studies using a scratch assay on 3T3 fibroblast cells seeded onto the hydrogel demonstrated a high cell survival rate and enhanced cell migration, suggesting potential for biomedical applications as a wound dressing material.",

The structural characterization, confirmed through XRD, SEM, FT-IR, and BET analyses, validated the formation of the MCM-41 framework with well-defined mesoporous properties and a high surface area of 159.6 m2/g. The developed Ca-MCM-41 was evaluated as a potential adsorbent for the removal of Sr2+ and B3+ ions from both aqueous solutions and real seawater samples collected from the Gulf of Suez, Egypt. The adsorption capacity at saturation reached 285.9 mg/g for Sr2+ and 86.1 mg/g for B3+, demonstrating the framework’s high affinity for these contaminants. The adsorption mechanisms were elucidated using steric and energetic parameters, as derived from statistical physics-based isotherm models. The Ca-MCM-41 framework exhibited a higher active site density (148.9 mg/g) for Sr2+ compared to B3+ (54.8 mg/g), explaining its superior sequestration performance for strontium ions. Each receptor site was capable of accommodating up to three Sr2+ ions and 2 B3+ ions, indicating a multi-ionic interaction process and preferential vertical alignment during adsorption. Energetic analysis revealed that the sequestration process occurred via physical adsorption with interaction energies below 7 kJ/mol, alongside exothermic and spontaneous behavior, as evidenced by calculated internal energy, entropy, and enthalpy values. The developed Ca-MCM-41 structure demonstrated notable efficiency in real seawater applications, achieving sequestration percentages of 80% for Sr2+ and 64% for B3+, considering their average concentrations (24.2 mg/L for Sr2+ and 12.85 mg/L for B3+) in a 1-L volume. These findings highlight the high potential of Ca-MCM-41 as an effective and sustainable adsorbent for Sr2+ and B3+ removal in environmental water treatment applications.",

Scaffold A compounds 10a-e and scaffold B compounds 13a-e. the structures of the newly synthesized compounds 10a-e and 13a-e were validated using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis.Results and DiscussionThe most effective antitubulin derivative was 10a, exhibiting an IC50 value of 2.69 μM. Subsequently, 10o and 13d exhibited IC50 values of 3.62 μM and 3.68 μM, respectively. These compounds exhibited more potency than the reference combretastatin A-4, which displayed an IC50 value of 8.33 μM. These compounds had no cytotoxic effects on normal cells, preserving over 85% cell viability at 50 μM. The antiproliferative experiment demonstrated that compounds 10a, 10o, and 13d displayed significant activity against four cancer cell lines, with average GI50 values of 6, 7, and 8 μM, equivalent to the reference’s doxorubicin and sorafenib.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. The oncoprotein MDM2 negatively regulates the tumor suppressor p53, and its overexpression in BC promotes tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents a promising therapeutic approach. However, many existing MDM2 inhibitors suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and off-target toxicity, necessitating the discovery of novel, more selective alternatives. This study aims to identify natural terpenoid compounds with potent MDM2 inhibitory potential through computational approaches.MethodsA library of 398 natural terpenoids was sourced from the NPACT database and filtered based on Lipinski’s Rule of Five. A two-stage docking strategy was applied: 1) rigid protein-flexible ligand docking to screen for high-affinity binders, followed by 2) ensemble docking using multiple MDM2 conformations derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The top candidates were further evaluated for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles using ADMET analysis. Finally, 150 ns MD simulations and binding free energy (MM-PBSA) calculations were performed to assess the stability and strength of protein-ligand interactions.ResultsThree terpenoid compounds, olean-12-en-3-beta-ol, cabralealactone, and 27-deoxyactein demonstrated strong binding affinities toward MDM2 in ensemble docking studies. ADMET analysis confirmed their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Further MD simulations indicated that these compounds formed highly stable complexes with MDM2. Notably, 27-deoxyactein exhibited the lowest binding free energy (−154.514 kJ/mol), outperforming the reference inhibitor Nutlin-3a (−133.531 kJ/mol), suggesting superior binding stability and interaction strength.ConclusionOur findings highlight 27-deoxyactein as a promising MDM2 inhibitor with strong binding affinity, stability, and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. This study provides a computational foundation for further experimental validation, supporting the potential of terpenoid-based MDM2 inhibitors in BC therapy.",

Silver (Ag) is one of the most effective dopants that can result in the retardation of the electron hole recombination-generating Schottky barrier at the TiO2 interface with a simultaneous extension of absorption to the visible region. This work presents a study on the effect of catechin, a bioactive principle polyphenol compound found in various plants, on the synthesis, Ag-doping and stabilization of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NPs). The nanoparticles were irregular in shape with sizes ranging from 19 to 30 nm. Ag-TiO2NPs were fabricated using TiO2 as a precursor and 1%, 3%, and 5% AgNO3 as a doping agent. The average particle size of 1%Ag-TiO2NPs, 3%Ag-TiO2NPs, and 5%Ag-TiO2NPs was 27.3 ± 7.5 nm, 29.8 ± 9.6 nm, and 25.0 ± 9.0 nm, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm corresponding to the Ag (111) plane in addition to the presence of the anatase phase of TiO2. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibited a broad peak around 400–800 cm−1 that was attributed to Ti-O-Ti stretching vibrations which was slightly shifted in Ag-TiO2NPs due to changes in the local bonding environment around Ti atoms caused by interactions with Ag. Catechin loading in the TiO2NPs and Ag-TiO2NPs was between 1.55 and 3.3 wt. %. TiO2NPs, 1%Ag-TiO2NPs, 3%Ag-TiO2NPs, and 5%Ag-TiO2NPs exhibited superior photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye up to 78%, 87%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, and RhB dye up to 92%, 94%, 97% and 99%, respectively, with a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, its recyclability was also demonstrated for three cycles. The simplicity of fabrication and superior photocatalytic performance of TiO2 demonstrated here make this green route advantageous for environmental applications to treat dye contaminated effluent as well as for numerous other applications.",

Studies have emphasised the necessity of addressing the presence of triclosan in water bodies to lessen its harmful impacts on the environment.MethodsIn this study, NaAlg/MnSx bio-nanocomposite hydrogel beads incorporated with different amounts of MnS NPs (0.02–0.2 g) were synthesised via the ionic gelation method and employed as an adsorbent for the removal of triclosan from aqueous solutions. The surface charge, morphology, thermal stability, crystallinity, and functional groups of NaAlg/MnS bio-nanocomposite hydrogel beads were characterised by SEM equipped with EDX, TEM, Thermogravimetric analysis, FTIR, XRD, and zeta sizer (mV).Results and discussionsThe experimental results demonstrated that incorporating 0.02–0.2 g of MnS NPs in the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels led to enhanced mechanical structure, porosity, and swelling ability for the adsorption of triclosan compared to pristine NaAlg hydrogel. The response surface methodology was used to optimise the experimental parameters affecting the batch adsorption of triclosan onto the surface of the adsorbent. Basic pH conditions were suitable for removing triclosan in aqueous solutions via hydrogen bonding with the carboxyl functional groups of the bio-nanocomposite beads. The pseudo-second order, Freundlich, and Sips models better explained the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm data. The maximum adsorption capacity estimated using the Langmuir isotherm model was 132 mg/g. The thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S)) were found to be 44.042 kJ/mol and 207.018 J/Kmol, respectively, which means the reaction is endothermic and increases randomisation at the solid/liquid interface. The Gibbs free energy (∆G) was negative throughout the studied temperature range, indicating that the adsorption process was spontaneously and energetically favoured.",

However, reports of thermally stable dielectric switching behavior in molecularly tailored 2D lead‐free copper chloride perovskites are limited. In this work, we employed monofluoride substitution to successfully regulate the crystal symmetry to achieve high‐temperature structural phase transition and switchable dielectric responses in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 (2‐FEA = 2‐fluoroethylaminium). Fluorine substitution establishes intermolecular C─H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions among the organic cations, driving a symmetry‐breaking transition from the parent tetragonal (EA)2CuCl4 (EA = ethylaminium) to a monoclinic phase in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 but it maintains a 2D perovskite structure. Consequently, (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 undergoes an evident order‐disorder structural transition (P21/c‐Cmce) around 351 K accompanied by dielectric switching behavior. Besides, eye‐catching thermochromic behavior has been evidenced by variable‐temperature UV–vis spectra revealing a temperature‐dependent bandgap redshift. This finding establishes fluoride substitution as a powerful strategy for the molecular engineering of multifunctional materials while providing valuable insights for the rational design of stimuli‐responsive hybrid systems.",

Consequently, the development of a selective and straightforward method for detecting CatS is crucial. In this study, we introduce a colorimetric approach utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and CatS‐specific peptides for the detection of CatS activity. The CatS enzyme cleavage peptides, PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2, can stabilize AuNPs in a hydrosaline solution without aggregation. Upon hydrolysis of PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 by CatS, the AuNPs aggregate with a color change from red to blue. After optimizing the size of the AuNPs and the concentration of the peptides, the limits of detection for CatS were both to be 10 nM, when PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 were used to protect the AuNPs. Therefore, this colorimetric assay, which employs peptides and AuNPs, enables not only a selective but also a simple detection of CatS, visible to the naked eye.",

Most conventional inhibitors are target‐specific and ineffective against broad‐spectrum viral infections. Therefore, the current scenario demands developing inhibitors to attenuate the membrane properties instead of targeting the viral proteins. In the present work, we have designed a new WD‐containing peptide (dmTG‐23) by introducing a WD repeat at the center of the peptide sequence using mTG‐23 peptide as a template and a 14‐amino acid peptide with seven WD repeats (WD‐14), and tested their efficacies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐induced fusion assay. Our findings show that both dmTG‐23 and WD‐14 prevent PEG‐induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol concentrations, with a higher effect for dmTG‐23. Moreover, we have compared our results with our previous observations on TG‐23 and mTG‐23 to evaluate the importance of the number and position of WD repeats in the peptide sequence to impart the highest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that three WD repeat‐containing dmTG‐23 shows the highest efficacy against the PEG‐induced fusion of SUVs by enhancing the membrane order at the acyl chain region. This result is significantly important in designing peptide‐based broad‐spectrum fusion inhibitors.",

It was shown that a larger strong Brønsted acidity enhanced the total aromatics formation with an increased light arenes content (especially at elevated WHSV). At low WHSV, excess Brønsted acidity leads to the declined aromatics yield due to its high cracking ability. On the contrary, a higher Lewis acidity and extensive mesoporosity promoted the heavier aromatics production accelerating the coke formation and shortening the catalyst lifetime. An improved aromatization performance and a prolonged durability of the zeolite catalyst were controlled by a balanced Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio and the ratio of WHSV to acid site concentration.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo elucidate the emergence and amplification of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral molecules and their assemblies, we designed positionally isomeric chiral V‐shaped Schiff base ligands and their corresponding bis(boron difluoride) complexes. The ligands were synthesized by condensing chiral cyclohexanediamine with either 1‐hydroxy‐2‐naphthaldehyde or 2‐hydroxy‐1‐naphthaldehyde, followed by complexation with boron difluoride (BF2) to yield CNB1 and CNB2, respectively. While the parent Schiff bases exhibited no CPL, BF2 coordination induced strong CPL signals in solution. Remarkably, upon aggregation in a mixed solvent system, CNB2 displayed enhanced and inverted CPL, whereas its isomer CNB1 showed attenuated emission. Through comprehensive characterization and singlecrystal analysis, we attribute this divergent behavior to distinct molecular packing modes: CNB2 forms tightly stacked aggregates with efficient π─π interactions, while CNB1 adopts a less ordered arrangement. This study establishes a clear correlation between subtle structural modifications, supramolecular packing, and CPL performance, offering a rational strategy for tailoring chiroptical properties through precise molecular design and controlled self‐assembly.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe growing global population and rising demand for pharmaceuticals highlight the need for efficient drug synthesis and detection methods. This study presents a bifunctional imidazole‐functionalized Hf(IV)‐based metal–organic framework (MOF), 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesizing 1,4‐dihydropyridines (1,4‐DHPs), which are key moieties in the synthesis of drugs used for cardiovascular treatments. The solvent‐free activated form of 1, labeled as 1′ catalyzes both Biginelli and Hantzsch reactions under mild conditions. The Biginelli reaction using aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea proceeded at 80 °C in 0.5 h with a 99% yield, while the Hantzsch reaction with aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate occurred at room temperature in ethanol within 1 h, also achieving a 99% yield. Compound 1′ showed broad substrate compatibility in both reactions. Additionally, the MOF exhibited excellent sensing ability for the anticancer drug raloxifene (RLX), showing a fast turn‐off fluorescence response (within 5 s), a low detection limit (9 nM), and a high Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv, 2 × 106 M⁻¹), enabling sensitive detection in diverse environments, including wastewater and biofluids. Detailed investigations into catalytic mechanisms and detection capabilities provide valuable insights for advancing drug synthesis and analytical methodologies. The study provides valuable insights into both the catalytic and sensing capabilities of 1′, demonstrating its potential for advanced pharmaceutical synthesis and real‐time drug monitoring.",

In this work, cellulose is derivatized with a thiol‐containing amino acid, cysteine, via two approaches to enhance silver anchoring by exploiting the high affinity between thiol groups and soft metals. The first method involves direct esterification to produce Cel‐Cys‐Est, while the second uses periodate oxidation to form dialdehyde cellulose (DAC), followed by linking with cysteine via a Schiff base reaction, creating DAC‐Cys. After confirming the successful cysteine derivatization using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the adsorption characteristics towards silver ions have been optimized for parameters like pH, adsorbent dosage, and ion concentration. The kinetic studies have shown the pseudo‐second‐order model for silver ion adsorption over both materials, while the isotherm studies have indicated Langmuir‐type monolayer adsorption. The silver‐loaded DAC‐Cys, having higher adsorption capacity, has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work highlights the versatility of cysteine‐derivatized cellulose as an effective, eco‐friendly material for silver ion sequestration and its promising application in antimicrobial domains.",

These dendritic metallogels exhibited intelligent stimuli‐responsive behavior, undergoing reversible gel–sol phase transitions in response to various external stimuli, such as temperature and chemical inputs. Furthermore, the dendritic metallogel, particularly in its xerogel form, demonstrated exceptional efficacy (>94% within 10 hours) and outstanding adsorption capacity (800 mg/g) in the removal of Hg2⁺ ions from aqueous solutions, highlighting its potential for environmental remediation applications.",

To address this, here we report the synthesis of cysteine‐capped copper nanoclusters (Cys‐Cu NCs) in just 30 min under ambient aqueous conditions. The incorporation of γ‐cyclodextrin (γ‐CD) enhanced the stability and immediately amplified the photoluminescence of the nanoclusters by triggering aggregation‐induced emission (AIE), increasing their quantum yield from 0.15 to 0.24. The remarkable photoluminescence of γ‐CD‐assisted Cys‐Cu NCs (γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs) was selectively quenched by protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), enabling ultrasensitive detection with an exceptionally low limit of 70 pM. Stern–Volmer analysis revealed the underlying interaction mechanisms between γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs and PPIX. This precise detection of PPIX is critical for diagnosing and monitoring porphyrias and other heme‐related disorders. The method demonstrated excellent PPIX recovery in complex biological matrices, such as human serum and artificial urine, across a broad PPIX concentration range (0.5–10 µM), highlighting its applicability in real‐world systems. Additionally, the nanoclusters exhibited strong sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS), underscoring their potential for oxidative stress monitoring.

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen has been deemed as the ideal energy source and carrier due to its unmatched energy efficiency and sustainability. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need to develop cost‐effective materials to replace costly Pt in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the electrocatalysts with low overpotential and robust stability under various conditions is a particularly significant concern. In this study, a straightforward and effective approach was proposed for the precise synthesis of RuP2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N, P, S‐tridoped carbon, which involves utilizing zinc pyrithione, phytic acid and Ru salt as starting materials. The effect of different Ru loadings on the morphology and structures of the composite catalysts was examined carefully. The obtained composites exhibit superior alkaline activity surpassing commercial Pt/C and comparable acidic and neutral activity as well as excellent pH‐wide stability. DFT computations reveal the integration of RuP2 with tridoped carbon can tailor the electronic structure of Ru active sites by interfacial electron transfer, thus optimizing the adsorption energy and promoting the HER activity. The benign graphitization of doped carbon and porous structures ensure the smooth charge and mass transfer during HER process. The cost‐effective and straightforward synthesis methods presented in this work offer a promising alternative to commercial Pt/C for practical hydrogen‐related applications.",

In this manuscript, we report that POSS can create hydrophobic spaces in ILs. In comparison with a series of POSS ILs and ion pairs, we investigated the effects of the POSS core on the microenvironment around dyes in ILs by evaluating normalized polarity and Kamlet–Taft parameters with several types of solvatochromic dyes as probes. Consequently, it was revealed that POSS ILs should have low polarity where POSS could play a critical role in enhancing intermolecular interactions from the directly‐connected anion to other species including cations and dyes. In terms of applications, it was found that low‐polarity POSS ILs have high compatibility with conventional conjugated polymers, which can be used for fabricating highly‐efficient luminescent ionic‐liquid hybrid films owing to the isolation of each polymer chain by POSS even under ionic environments.",

Regioselective ring‐opening cyclization of cyclohexane‐1,3‐dione‐2‐spirocyclopropanes using sodium hydrosulfide as a sulfur‐transfer reagent proceeded smoothly and subsequent addition of an acid afforded the corresponding tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen‐4‐one derivatives in good to excellent yields. Cycloheptane‐1,3‐dione‐2‐spirocyclopropanes could be also applied to the present protocol. In contrast, the reaction of monocyclic 1,1‐diacetyl‐2‐phenylcyclopropane with sodium hydrosulfide and subsequent addition of an acid gave decomposition products instead of the desired product. This result suggests that the spiro structure is crucial for successful ring‐opening cyclization. One of the products obtained from cyclohexane‐1,3‐dione‐2‐spirocyclopropanes could be converted into the 2‐substituted 4‐hydroxybenzo[b]thiophene derivative while avoiding oxidation of the sulfide to sulfoxide or sulfone. This protocol provides an alternative synthetic method to access benzo[b]thiophenes without using multisubstituted benzenes as starting materials, which are often difficult to prepare. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from cyclopropanes.",

Real‐time monitoring of extracellular Ca2⁺ concentrations ([Ca2+]e) can provide valuable quantitative insights into programmed cell death, which may greatly benefit cancer therapy and other biological applications. This study used a modified ion‐sensitive field‐effect transistor (ISFET) as a platform for Ca2⁺ sensing. The ISFET device was functionalized with a Ca2⁺‐selective membrane containing polyurethane (PU) and calcium ionophore II. The Ca2⁺‐FET device exhibited a sensitivity of 35 ± 3 mV/pCa (pCa 0–5) toward Ca2⁺ with insignificant cross‐sensitivity to other ions, such as sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺). The device was applied to monitor [Ca2+]e concentrations in the MDA‐MB‐231 breast cancer cell culture, showing sufficient reliance in detecting Ca2⁺ concentrations (0.1 mM to 1 M (pCa 0–5)) correlated with cellular activities. This technique offers a noninvasive and label‐free approach for real‐time Ca2⁺ monitoring in cell culture, with potential applications in cancer research and therapeutic development.",

This study demonstrates how the optical properties of N, S co‐doped carbon nanodots can be effectively tuned through variation in solvents. Drastic change is noted in the physico–chemical features of CNDs achieved using sulphuric acid and water through solvothermal route. A red shift in emission is noted in system achieved using sulfuric acid medium. The synthesized CNDs are explored for light emitting diode (LED) application. CNDs achieved using hydrothermal method (MCDs) lead to pure white light (CIE coordinates: 0.33, 0.38) emitting LEDs, and sulfuric acid modification (SMCD) produces LEDs emitting in yellowish‐orange light (CIE coordinates: 0.57, 0.42), due to enhanced oxidation of carbon core. Further, the difference in solvents is also reflected in the response of these CNDS toward external analytes. Picric acid induced luminescence quenching of SMCDs enabled selective detection of the analyte among 11 nitroaromatic compounds, highlighting the impact of surface functionalization in tuning the response toward external environments. The sensing mechanism, involving the inner filter effect and static quenching, as well as the selective response to picric acid, was confirmed through optical characterization and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis.",

Photophysical studies of the push‐pull fluorophores 8a and 8b revealed a positive solvatochromic effect with Δμ > 15D and Stokes shifts of up to 270 nm. Experimental data and theoretical calculations of the ground and excited states of the compounds demonstrated that pyridoindoles 4a‐e and 7a,b exhibit a planarized intramolecular charge‐transfer (PLICT) state, which is accompanied by a gradual increase in luminescence quantum yield for samples 4d and 7b with increasing solvent polarity. Probe 4b, characterized by an acid dissociation constant (pKa) of 5.5, showed high sensitivity to local pH changes in the microenvironment. A “turn‐off” acidochromic response was observed for 4d and 8a with Stern–Volmer quenching constants of 1.6 × 103 and 5.5 × 103 M−1, respectively, while a “turn‐off‐on” response was detected for 4b and 8b during titration with TFA. Fluorescence and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy studies of the interaction between probe 4b and calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) confirmed a static quenching mechanism with the formation of 4b‐ctDNA complex, indicating that the probe binds to the DNA helix via a groove binding mode.

A single regioisomeric thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole staple was formed, generating the thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole‐bridged peptide. The stapling reaction can be carried out in various solvents. Moreover, the obtained nonsymmetric cyclic peptides were stable in PBS solution. Furthermore, three bicyclic peptides containing both an acetone‐like bridge and the thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole bridge were synthesized via two stapling strategies: (1) a symmetric stapling reaction of 1,3‐dichloroacetone (DCA) with two Cys residues, and (2) a nonsymmetric stapling reaction of ATA with Lys and Cys residues. Satisfied yields of the bicyclic peptides were achieved. The positions of the two bridges determined the synthetic accessiblity of the bicyclic peptides. Certainly, a wide variety of thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole‐bridged nonsymmetric cyclic peptides can be designed, thus entrenching the methodologies in peptide cyclization.

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study investigates the effects of Nd3⁺ doping and thermal annealing (at 250, 500, 650, and 800 °C) on the structural and luminescent properties of Nd3⁺‐doped Na₂Ti₆O₁₃ nanocrystals (NCs), with a focus on their potential for thermal sensing applications. The optimal doping concentration was found to be 0.5 wt% Nd3⁺, where luminescence intensity decreases with higher concentrations due to concentration quenching. Thermal annealing significantly enhances both the crystallinity and luminescence intensity of the NCs, with the most notable improvements observed up to 500 °C. However, heating beyond 650 °C induces a phase transition from Na₂Ti₆O₁₃ to TiO₂, which impacts the NCs' structural and luminescent properties. Thermal sensing performance was evaluated using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) between emissions at 1060 nm and 1340 nm across a temperature range of 300–343K, revealing the highest relative thermal sensitivity (Sr) of 3.28% K⁻¹ in the sample annealed at 250 °C. For applications requiring high emission intensity, the 0.5 wt% Nd3⁺‐doped Na₂Ti₆O₁₃ NCs annealed at 800 °C exhibited the highest figure of merit, combining high luminescence intensity at 1060 nm with excellent Sr, making them ideal for nanothermometry. Notably, the excitation (808 nm) and emission wavelengths (900, 1060, and 1340 nm) fall within the biological tissue windows, suggesting significant potential for biological nanothermometry applications. This study underscores the critical role of optimizing both doping concentration and thermal annealing conditions to enhance the properties of NCs, offering new insights into their use for advanced thermal sensing applications in biological and medical fields.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDesign and synthesis of the fluorophores with tailored emission is critical for advanced optoelectronic applications, including white LEDs. Here in this study, we synthesized benzo[d]thiazole‐based donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) systems to achieve efficient fluorophores with tunable‐emission properties. Three luminogens (based on triphenylamine, diphenylamine, and carbazole as donor units and benzo[d]thiazole as acceptor units) were designed, synthesized, and explored as phosphors for white LEDs. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction revealed significant twisting in the molecular geometries. These twisted structures effectively reduced conjugation, which resulted in a greenish‐blue emission in nonpolar solvents. The photophysical properties of these compounds were investigated through solvatochromism experiments and Lippert–Mataga plots, and the study reveals that the compounds have a hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) character in their excited states. Lifetime studies revealed mono‐ and bi‐exponential decay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to optimize the geometries, and a close match between the theoretical and single‐crystal structures was observed. Further, the selected luminogens were integrated with a red‐emitting Eu(III) phosphor and PMMA matrix to fabricate a white light‐emitting diode (LED). The white LED device exhibited a color rendering index (CRI = 74), excellent chromaticity coordinates (x = 0.29, y = 0.30), a correlated color temperature (CCT = 7207 K), and a luminous efficacy of radiation (LER = 320 lm/W). We observed that introducing an additional diphenylamine donor in the D–A–D system (Py‐28–2) enhanced the absolute PLQY to 46.33%. These results demonstrate the potential of these donor‐acceptor systems for applications in opto‐electronics and lighting technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignocellulose‐based furan compounds holds significant potential for the synthesis of aviation fuel. However, challenges such as high catalyst costs and low yields persist. This study proposes a two‐step strategy, involving pre‐hydrogenation followed by HDO, to convert the C15 condensation product derived from furfural and levulinic acid into hydrocarbons within the aviation fuel range. A Ni‐based catalyst supported on zirconium phosphate (ZrP) with the incorporation of Nb2O5 was synthesized. At 340 °C, 4 MPa H2, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 14.9, using Ni‐Nb2O5/ZrP as the catalyst for HDO, considering the pre‐hydrogenation, the overall yield of alkanes in the C10–C15 jet fuel range from solid condensation products FLF is 62.4%, with a yield of C15 alkanes of 16.2% and C14 alkanes of 25.2%. A series of characterizations and comparative experiments were carried out. Experimental studies have demonstrated that doping with Nb2O5 plays a crucial role in enhancing the HDO performance. The characterization results indicate that the introduction of an appropriate amount of Nb2O5 increased the electron density of ZrP, enriched the catalyst's acidic sites, in addition, the ratio of Bronsted acid to Lewis acid sites in the catalyst increases. Finally, a brief analysis of industrialization potential was conducted.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRadical cyclizations are powerful tools for complexity building, providing facile access to functionalized cyclic adducts. However, forging two contiguous tetrasubstituted carbons via radical cyclization through the addition of tertiary radicals to geminally disubstituted sp2 carbons has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of double‐bond geometry at the geminally disubstituted sp2 carbon on reactivity and stereochemical outcomes remains underexplored. In this study, we present experimental and computational studies on the carbooxygenation of 2‐fluoro‐3‐aryl‐allyl nitroacetates to investigate reactivity and selectivity differences between (E)‐ and (Z)‐isomers. First, we identify that (E)‐isomers are less reactive than (Z)‐isomers. Second, both (E)‐ and (Z)‐isomers undergo conversion to α,α,β,β‐tetrasubstituted γ‐lactones with high syn‐selectivity, despite the absence of putative E/Z isomerization of the alkene unit. Third, incorporating an electron‐donating group at the radical acceptor enhances the reactivity of (E)‐isomers in catalytic aerobic carbooxygenation. Fourth, computational studies show that syn‐selectivity is mainly governed by the fluorine‐induced gauche effect, whereas SOMO–HOMO level inversion induced by the electron‐donating group at the radical acceptor enhances (E)‐isomer reactivity. Based on these mechanistic insights, we develop a diastereoconvergent protocol using the E/Z mixture as a starting material to synthesize a potent antifungal agent.",

Herein, the agricultural waste and sweet potato extraction residues (SPR) were converted into hierarchially porous carbons (HPCs) by a facile method using KOH as the activation agent. The as‐obtained SPR‐HPCs exhibited a well developed pore structure and very high specific surface area (SSA). By controlling the fabrication conditions including the dosage of KOH and activation temperature, the optimized SPR‐HPC‐3.5–800 had an ultrahigh SSA of 3206 m2 g−1 with high pore volume of 2.132 cm3 g−1. When used as electrode materials, the electrochemical studies demonstrated that the SPR‐HPC‐3.5–800 based electrode achieved high specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and the symmetrical supercapacitor in 6 M KOH achieved energy density of 6.8 Wh kg−1 at 249 W kg−1. Furthermore, high electrochemical stability was achieved for the SPR‐HPCs. This study provides a good example of the production of value‐added products from biowastes.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen-like light muonic ions, in which one negative muon replaces all of the electrons, are extremely sensitive probes of nuclear structure. Using pulsed laser spectroscopy, we have measured three 2\n            S\n            -2\n            P\n            transitions in the muonic helium-3 (μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            ) ion, an ion formed by a negative muon and bare helium-3 nucleus. This allowed us to extract the Lamb shift, the 2\n            P\n            fine structure splitting, and the 2\n            S\n            -hyperfine splitting in μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            . Comparing these measurements with theory, we determined the root-mean-square charge radius of the helion (\n            3\n            He nucleus) to be\n            \n              r\n              h\n            \n            = 1.97007(94) fm, in good agreement with the value from elastic electron scattering but a factor 15 more accurate.

We show that the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a central 53BP1 axis component, suppresses DNA end resection by EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex but acts by distinct mechanisms in restricting these entities. Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis.",

However, central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic. A lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. Here, we silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.",

Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts. These membranes, which feature fast and selective transport of hydrocarbons, including multicomponent and industrially relevant mixtures, outperform commercial and state-of-the-art benchmark membranes.",

Global commitment to these objectives is reflected by the treaty’s total membership of 188 states. However, member states have thus far been unable to raise strong barriers against illicit bioweapons development. With rapid advancements in science and technology and the rise of biological weapons disinformation, improvements of the Convention are urgently needed. One way to reinforce the treaty is to consider an inspection mechanism that aims to disrupt illicit programs rather than detect them.",

The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star.

In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.",

Using genetic sequences along three ocean transects, we compiled 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds and estimated their degree of optimization for rapid growth (copiotrophy). Data and model consistency indicated that gradients in grazing and substrate lability predominantly set biogeographical patterns, and we identified deep-ocean “slow copiotrophs” whose ecological interactions control the surface accumulation of dissolved organic carbon.",

This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration. We discuss conditions under which beneﬁts from skilled migration may outweigh costs and also describe potential research paths to inform policy.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multi-tonne herbivores is a recurrent aspect of the Cenozoic mammalian radiation. Several of these giants have vanished within the past 130,000 years, but the timing and macroevolutionary drivers behind this pattern of rise and collapse remain unclear for some megaherbivore lineages. Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.",

To demonstrate this, we first prepared atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures, errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.",

TC IV were almost exclusively present within mesenteric lymph nodes suggesting that the presence of TC IV underlies the phenomenon of oral tolerance. A wave of TC IV differentiation in the peri-weaning period was associated with a window of opportunity for enhanced pTreg generation in response to food antigens. Our findings indicate that TC IV may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of food-associated allergic and inflammatory diseases.",

Bulk and interface characterizations by multimodal synchrotron x-ray probes and cryo–transmission electron microscopy show that the in situ segregated lithium halide interfacial layers substantially boost effective ion transport and suppress the volume change of bulk chalcogen cathodes. Various all-solid-state lithium-chalcogen cells demonstrate utilization close to 100% and extraordinary cycling stability at commercial-level areal capacities.",

Pervasive species redistribution poses substantial threats to mountain ecosystems, a phenomenon sometimes described as an “escalator to extinction,” primarily through mountaintop extinctions, range shift gaps (i.e., rapid shifts of suitable temperatures getting ahead of narrow-range species’ upper limits), and lowland biodiversity attrition, yet empirical evidence remains scarce. In this study, our analysis of 8800 records of historical and modern elevational range limits for 440 animal and 1629 plant species revealed little evidence supporting the proposed threats. Observed changes largely fell within random expectations, accounting for geometric constraints. Although delayed mountaintop extinctions point to accumulating extinction debt, concurrent range expansions of both narrow-range and lowland species suggest thermal niche underfilling, processes that collectively drive biotic homogenization across biologically complex mountain ecosystems.",

In this work, we apply Indigenous and Western scientific methods, including genomics and isotope profiling, on fossils from across Beringia to explore the effect of climate change on horses. We find that Late Pleistocene horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times during the last glacial interval. We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth. Our combined Western and Indigenous framework offers critical guidance for wildlife conservation amid ongoing climate change.",

The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except 18% of IAVI-G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM, and heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development. The results establish clinical proof of concept that heterologous boosting can advance bnAb-precursor maturation and demonstrate bnAb priming in Africa where the HIV burden is highest.",

Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.",

In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 human clinical trial, the recombinant, germline-targeting envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer BG505 SOSIP.v4.1-GT1.1, adjuvanted with AS01\n            B\n            , induced bnAb precursors of the VRC01-class at a high frequency in the majority of vaccine recipients. These bnAb precursors, that target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "How astrocytes regulate neuronal circuits is a fundamental question in neurobiology. Specifically, how astrocytes respond to different neurotransmitters in vivo and how they affect downstream circuit modulation are questions that remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we report a mechanism in\n            Drosophila\n            by which G protein–coupled adrenergic signaling in astrocytes can control—or “gate”—their ability to respond to other neurotransmitters. Further, we show that manipulating this pathway potently regulates neuronal circuit activity and animal behavior. This gating mechanism is conserved in cultured primary mammalian astrocytes, suggesting that it might be an ancient feature of astrocyte circuit function. Our work establishes a mechanism by which astrocytes dynamically respond to and modulate neuronal activity in different brain regions and in different behavioral states.",

    "abstract": "Both neurons and glia communicate through diffusible neuromodulators; however, how neuron-glial interactions in such neuromodulatory networks influence circuit computation and behavior is unclear. During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.",

This multispecies, multiorgan organoid panel showed species- and tissue-specific replication patterns for several viruses, offering robust pathophysiological models for studying respiratory, renal, and enteric zoonotic viruses. Using this platform, we successfully isolated and characterized bat-borne mammalian orthoreoviruses and paramyxoviruses, demonstrating the utility of these organoid panels for virome surveillance.

At low densities, the Wigner solid forms nanocrystalline domains pinned by local disorder. It exhibits a quantum densification behavior with increased densities in the solid phase. Above a threshold density, the Wigner solid melts locally and enters a mixed phase in which solid and liquid regions coexist. The liquid regions expand and form a percolation network at even higher densities.",

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cannot synthesize ATP but must import cytoplasmic ATP to energize protein folding, quality control and trafficking2,3. It was recently proposed that a member of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, termed SLC35B1 (also known as AXER), is not a nucleotide sugar transporter but a long-sought-after ER importer of ATP4. Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter.",

Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3–5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine1,2, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi3-5. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth3, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate6-8 have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures9,10. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius11-13 feature large dentine tubules1 that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth14-16. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth16. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Skeletal editing comprises the structural reorganization of compounds. Such editing can be achieved through atom swapping, atom insertion, atom deletion or reorganization of the compound’s backbone structure1,2. Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles. The compound classes obtained through these methods—indazoles3,4, benzisoxazoles5, benzimidazoles6,7 and benzoxazoles8—are biologically relevant moieties found as substructures in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The procedures introduced substantially enlarge the methods portfolio in the emerging field of skeletal editing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The decline in malaria deaths has recently stalled owing to several factors, including the widespread resistance of Anopheles vectors to the insecticides used in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)1,2. One way to mitigate insecticide resistance is to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage of development by incorporating antiparasitic compounds into LLINs. This strategy can prevent onward parasite transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy3,4. Here, we performed an in vivo screen of compounds against the mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development. Of the 81 compounds tested, which spanned 28 distinct modes of action, 22 were active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen, which in turn prevented establishment of infection. Medicinal chemistry was then used to improve antiparasitic activity of the top hits from the screen. We generated several endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) that inhibited the P. falciparum cytochrome bc\n            1 complex (CytB). Two lead compounds that targeted separate sites in CytB (Qo and Qi) showed potent, long-lasting and stable activity when incorporated and/or extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films. ELQ activity was fully preserved in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and parasites resistant to these compounds had impaired development at the mosquito stage. These data demonstrate the promise of incorporating ELQ compounds into LLINs to counteract insecticide resistance and to reduce malaria transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Phosphorus availability has influenced the co-evolution of life and Earth’s environments. While phosphate was likely the main phosphorus source for life during the Archean, phosphite (HPO3\n            2\n            −) gained importance leading up to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, the concentration of phosphite in seawater at that time, and the processes driving this shift in P utilization, remain poorly constrained. Using lab experiments and phosphite data from banded iron formations (BIFs), we show that hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) preferentially remove phosphate over phosphite. This suggests that shallow seawater at the onset of the GOE could have contained up to 0.17 µM phosphite, comprising 5–88% of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus. We propose that phosphate depletion driven by HFO adsorption and microbial competition may have promoted the use of phosphite as an alternative P source.",

These nonlinear photocurrent properties could be further extended with broken time reversal symmetry present in magnetic materials, however, the combination of time reversal and rotation symmetry breaking has not been fully explored. Herein, we investigate the nonlinear photovoltaic responses in van der Waals heterostructure compromising of monolayer semiconductor and layered magnetic material, MoS2/CrPS4; a system with broken P- and T-symmetry. We clearly observe the finite spontaneous photocurrent as shift current at the interface of the MoS2/CrPS4 heterostructure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spontaneous photocurrent drastically changes according to the magnetic phases of CrPS4. The magnetic phase dependent spontaneous nonlinear photocurrent provides a platform for studying nonlinear photoresponses in systems with broken P- and T-symmetry, and the potential development of magnetic controllable photovoltaic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Negative differential resistance (NDR), a peculiar electrical property in which current decreases with increasing voltage, is highly desirable for multivalued logic gates, memory devices, and oscillators. Recently, 2D quantum-tunneling NDR devices have attracted considerable attention because of the inherent atomically flat and dangling-bond-free surfaces of 2D materials. However, the low current density of 2D NDR devices limits their operating frequency to less than 2 MHz. In this study, graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/graphene resonant tunneling transistors (RTTs) were fabricated using graphene and h-BN barriers with different numbers of atomic layers, showing a mechanism enabling the observation of NDR in high current density devices. A triangular etching approach was proposed to suppress the effects of graphene–metal contact resistance and graphene sheet resistance, enabling pronounced NDR effect even in a 2D tunneling device with a single atomic layer h-BN barrier. A room-temperature peak current density up to 2700 μA/μm2 and operational frequencies up to 11 GHz were achieved, demonstrating the potential of 2D quantum NDR devices for applications in high-speed electronics.",

Our approach employs rational ligand engineering of porous nanoparticles, optimizing ligand orientation for efficient stomata targeting across different plant species. Foliar application of SENDS encapsulating an antimicrobial plant alkaloid reduces colonization of Xanthomonas campestris, a major crop pathogen, by 20-fold compared to untargeted nanocarriers. Quantitative assessment of stomatal aperture movement and photosynthetic performance confirms that SENDS enhance plant defense against invading pathogens without disrupting natural stomatal function. This nanobiotechnology approach provides a targeted strategy to improve plant disease resistance, offering new insights into nanocarrier design for more resilient and sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          High-throughput massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and phenotype-rich in vivo transgenic mouse assays are two potentially complementary ways to study the impact of noncoding variants associated with psychiatric diseases. Here, we investigate the utility of combining these assays. Specifically, we carry out an MPRA in induced human neurons on over 50,000 sequences derived from fetal neuronal ATAC-seq datasets and enhancers validated in mouse assays. We also test the impact of over 20,000 variants, including synthetic mutations and 167 common variants associated with psychiatric disorders. We find a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity. Four out of five tested variants with significant MPRA effects affected neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos. Mouse assays also reveal pleiotropic variant effects that could not be observed in MPRA. Our work provides a catalog of functional neuronal enhancers and variant effects and highlights the effectiveness of combining MPRAs and mouse transgenic assays.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The emplacement of large igneous provinces (LIPs) is known to be a driver of climate change in Earth’s past. However, the balance of climate warming through CO2 emission and cooling through weathering is poorly understood. To better understand the role of LIP emplacement on long-term climate change, here we utilize the SCION coupled climate-biogeochemical model which considers the impact of LIPs through degassing of CO2 and enhancement of local continental weathering rates. This approach results in better correspondence between the modelled output and proxy reconstructions of the period (especially for seawater Sr isotope composition) when compared to previous modelling studies. Of the seven LIPs during the breakup phase of Pangaea (approximately 300–150 Ma), only the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) drives noticeable long-term cooling in the model, a minor effect (between 1-2 °C) despite emplacement of a very large surface area in the humid tropics. Similarly, only the CAMP imparts a significant change in the long-term Sr isotope record whereas the other LIPs of this period do not. Due to limited areal extents, and emplacement outside tropical weathering zones, we conclude most LIPs have no significant global cooling effect on multimillion year timescales.",

Here, we develop a lab-on-device system for molybdenum oxide to probe operando hydrogenation mechanisms through in situ electrical and spectral characterization with density functional theory calculations, revealing threshold-driven proton dynamics that govern the transition between nonvolatile memory operation and catalytic hydrogen evolution. Moderate proton intercalation (flux 17 cm-2) achieves a five-order conductance modulation under ambient conditions via polaron formation and stoichiometric optimization (H/Mo up to 22%, Mo/O approaching ideal ratios), outperforming oxygen vacancy engineering. Beyond this threshold (flux ~1017 cm-2), intensive proton intercalation triggers electric-to-chemical energy conversion, directly linking proton history to catalytic activity. Leveraging these principles, we achieve nonvolatile electrochemical memory with linear synaptic and accumulative neuronal functionalities, and demonstrate an all electrochemical random-access memory neural network hardware that executes memory-efficient rank-order coding for sparse signals even under noisy conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Exploring the expansive and largely untapped chemical space of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) holds promise for revolutionising the field of materials science. MOFs, hailed for their modular architecture, offer unmatched flexibility in customising functionalities to meet specific application needs. However, navigating this chemical space to identify optimal MOF structures poses a significant challenge. Traditional high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), while useful, is often limited by a distribution bias towards materials not aligned with the desired functionalities. To overcome these limitations, this study adopts a “deep dreaming” methodology to optimise MOFs in silico, aiming to generate structures with systematically shifted properties that are closer to target functionalities from the outset. Our approach integrates property prediction and structure optimisation within a single interpretable framework, leveraging a specialised chemical language model augmented with attention mechanisms. Focusing on a curated set of MOF properties critical to applications like carbon capture and energy storage, we demonstrate how deep dreaming can be utilised as a tool for targeted material design.",

Droughts can worsen air quality in regions that rely on hydropower by shifting energy production to combustion power plants. This study quantifies drought-induced excess PM2.5 in Latin America and the Caribbean, where over 443 million people live within 50 km of a combustion power plant. Leveraging a monthly plant-level panel spanning 20 years, we link hydrological droughts, measured as negative runoff anomalies in hydropower watersheds, to changes in PM2.5 concentrations near combustion power plants. Our analysis reveals that these droughts lead to an average increase of 0.83 μg m−3 in PM2.5 levels. Counterfactual simulations for the region reveal that this excess PM2.5 results in up to 10,000 premature deaths annually. Combining our estimates with climate, demographic, and combustion power plant phase-out projections, we demonstrate that this health burden will persist over the next four decades without targeted interventions.",

While clinically heterogeneous, converging evidence suggests a shared brain network may underlie tremor across conditions. Here, we empirically define such a network using four modalities: lesion locations, atrophy patterns, EMG-fMRI, and deep brain stimulation outcomes. We show that network connectivity robustly explains clinical outcomes in independent cohorts undergoing deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson’s disease and the ventral intermediate nucleus for essential tremor. Maps from each cohort accounted for outcomes in the respective other, supporting a disorder-independent tremor network. A multimodal agreement map revealed consistent substrates in the primary motor cortex and motor cerebellum. To validate the network, we test its predictive power in a third, independent cohort treated with pallidal stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. Our findings define a robust, cross-condition tremor network that may guide both invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Glioblastoma remains a challenging indication for immunotherapy: the blood-brain barrier hampers accessibility for systemic treatments and the immunosuppressive microenvironment impedes immune attack. Intratumoral therapy with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) can revert immunosuppression but leakage into the circulation causes treatment-limiting toxicity. Here we engineer an IL-12Fc fusion cytokine with reduced binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn. FcRn-silenced IL-12Fc avoids FcRn-mediated brain export, thus exhibits prolonged brain retention and reduced blood levels, which prevents toxicity. In murine glioblastoma, FcRn-silenced IL-12Fc induces more durable responses with negligible systemic cytokine exposure and boosts the efficacy of radio- and chemotherapy. It triggers anti-tumor responses independently of peripheral T cell influx or lymphopenia and leads to inflammatory polarization of the tumor microenvironment in patient-derived glioblastoma explants. FcRn-silencing of IL-12Fc may unlock the full potential of IL-12 for brain cancer therapy and could be further applied to containing the activity of other therapeutics targeting neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "The development of inherently flexible battery electrodes remains a key challenge for modern wearable electronics. Despite the advancement of flexible Lithium‐ion (Li+) batteries, achieving full adaptability requires redesigning individual battery components. Conventional graphite electrodes are used in Li+ batteries but remain rigid and brittle, limiting applications in flexible energy storage. Here, this limitation is addressed by integrating nanocellulose (NCF), a nanoscale biopolymer, with graphite (G), to yield an intrinsically flexible electrode platform. Five NCF/G battery electrode compositions with increasing NCF content (40–70 wt%) are fabricated via a straightforward aqueous route and are evaluated in Li+ half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li+ and NCF surface groups suggesting Li+ diffusion through nanochannels. A perspective on the material‐driven reshaping of flexible NCF/G battery electrodes is provided, by investigating the contribution of NCF to charge storage mechanisms and to mechanical resilience. This study contributes to the development of battery electrodes that can be tailored to energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics applications, and towards battery market diversification.",

    "abstract": "The electroreduction of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers promising opportunities for the synthesis of valuable chemical precursors. However, achieving high selectivity in this process remains challenging due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved. Here, this study employs different electrochemical techniques to analyze each of the HMF electroreduction pathways. These findings demonstrate that the primary products of HMF electroreduction are 2,5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 5‐methylfurfural alcohol (MFA), with lower formation of 5‐methylfurfural (5‐MF) and 2,5‐dimethylfuran. This study identifies a significant competition between hydrogen evolution reaction and the reduction of HMF and 5‐MF that affect the faradaic efficiencies of the organic transformation. In contrast, BHMF and MFA display a reduced reactivity, behaving as terminal molecules. Through impedance analysis, it is possible to follow the reaction pathways by associating each reaction step with the changes observed in charge transfer and accumulation phenomena. These are key parameters for understanding the reaction mechanisms in the system as they allow to distinguish between adsorption, absorption and reaction of the organic molecules onto the electrode surface. This approach helps to accurately select the optimal potential for the reduction reactions. The results obtained in this study facilitate the design of efficient and selective electrocatalytic systems for biomass conversion.",

However, their broader application has been hindered by synthetic challenges. Herein, the electrochemical synthesis of a ten‐membered cyclic azobenzene, 6,7‐dihydrodibenzo[e,i][1,4,7,8]dioxadiazecine (DDEI), is reported through the reduction of 1,2‐bis(2‐nitrophenoxy)ethane (BNPOE) in the presence of CO2. The reduction mechanism, involving an irreversible eight‐electron process and CO2 capture, is elucidated using in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) spectroelectrochemistry, complemented by 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry analyzes. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that DDEI undergoes highly efficient trans‐to‐cis isomerization under green light (500 nm) irradiation, achieving a remarkable yield of 97%, with both isomers exhibiting excellent thermal stability. In contrast to 8‐ and 9‐membered cyclic azobenzenes and in line with conventional linear azobenzenes, the trans configuration of DDEI is more stable than the cis configuration. This combination of synthetic accessibility and superior photophysical properties makes DDEI a promising candidate for various applications, including those in living systems.",

    "abstract": "Catalyst dissolution is one of the key challenges in achieving long‐term performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with low iridium loading. However, most of the dissolved catalyst remains in the catalyst‐coated membrane, inaccessible for operando quantification. While simpler aqueous model systems improve mechanistic understanding, dissolution rates are significantly overestimated compared to the device level. To bridge this gap, herein, an electrochemical half‐cell setup that mimics the anode catalyst layer environment to enable operation at relevant current densities (>1 ) is presented. Dissolved catalyst species transported through the porous transport layer or through the membrane are separately detected operando by coupling to inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate a strong preference for the transport of dissolved iridium through the membrane (99.9%) and a decrease in catalyst stability by factor 10 at high current densities. Discrepancies with so far reported findings from full‐cell and half‐cell experiments highlight a lack of understanding of catalyst dissolution and the transportation of dissolved species in different systems. The presented method offers unique insights which will help to study and optimize catalyst dissolution by means of various manufacturing and operation parameters to ultimately improve the stability of catalyst layers for water electrolysis.",

Herein, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with the [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic [Fe2(μ‐pdt)(CO)6, 1, where pdt = propane‐1,3‐dithiolate] in acetonitrile is reported. In the presence of the weak acid, methanol (MeOH), 1 reduces CO2 to both CO (Faradaic Efficiency maximum [FEmax] of 16 ± 6%) and HCOO− (FEmax = 20%) and produces H2 (FEmax = 56 ± 4%). Without added MeOH, 1 reacts with adventitious water to form H2 (FEmax = 85 ± 1%), HCOO− (FEmax = 7.8%), and CO (FEmax = 7 ± 3%) with CO32− being detected by infrared spectroscopy.  Product formation is potential dependent: more negative potentials increases selectivity for HCOO− over CO. The first reduction of 1 forms a pdt‐bridged dimer, 2. However, the reduction of 2 at the potentials required for electrochemical CO2 reduction leads to two new species. Using density functional theory, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR‐SEC), these structures are identified to be [Fe(CO)4]2− (3) and a trinuclear Fe3 species (4). While these species can reduce CO2 to CO and HCOO−, the predominant formation of H2 reveals kinetic issues in  CO2 reduction. The work offers to consider alternate competing mechanistic pathways and explains the lack of product selectivity when using hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO−.",

Recent studies on tuning the microenvironment near the catalyst surfaces by tuning the local electric field in nonaqueous environments have been shown to promote eCO2R by facilitating the CO2 activation step. Herein, the use of tetraethylammonium (TEA) cation to tune the electric field on Fe surfaces, such that it leads to the formation of industrially relevant oxalates (C2 products), is reported. At optimal cation concentrations, the developed eCO2R system achieves 25 mA cm−2 of current density and Faradaic Efficiencies up to 75% toward oxalate. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of surface‐adsorbed TEA cations and other species on the Fe surfaces, leading to the well‐known outer‐sphere mechanism of electron transfer during eCO2R. The employment of Fe, along with microenvironment tuning, not only demonstrates high catalytic performance but also provides a safer and more sustainable alternative to toxic catalysts such as Pb that dominate the nonaqueous eCO2R literature. These findings pave the way for further optimization and scale‐up of the process, offering a viable route for sustainable chemical production and CO2 mitigation.",

    "abstract": "The superhydrophobic modification of Cu2O electrodes has shown great promise in enhancing CO2 reduction due to the formation of a triple phase boundary at the surface, allowing high concentrations of CO2, which is not achievable in typical aqueous media. Herein, a two‐step study is undertaken to investigate and optimize hydrophobic modification of electrodeposited Cu2O nanomaterial electrodes. First, the electrochemical deposition potentials are altered in equivalent electrolyte conditions, which is found to alter the size of the deposited nanomaterials and the corresponding electrode surface roughness. Second, the electrodes are soaked in thiol‐containing solutions containing a range of both aromatic and aliphatic thiols to achieve chemically modified self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the electrode surfaces. The surface and morphological properties of the electrodeposited electrodes are assessed with scanning electron microscopy, laser confocal, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Confocal and AFM also allow the determination of the surface roughness of the electrodes at both the microscale and the nanoscale. The presence of SAM‐modification is determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angles are also measured on the nonthiol‐modified and thiol‐modified electrodes, and the contact angle is found to increase from 70°–100° to 130°–140°, close to superhydrophobic levels of contact angles.",

    "abstract": "Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), widely used in electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications, are increasingly expected to deliver higher energy densities and stable performance over a wide temperature range, posing stringent challenges for advanced electrolyte design. However, achieving these properties remains challenging with currently commercialized ethylene carbonate (EC)‐based electrolytes. Herein, a propylene carbonate (PC)‐based electrolyte system is reported, employing hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as synergistic additives. Specifically, HFB facilitates compatibility with graphite anodes through selective interfacial adsorption, while the decomposition of FEC stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), mitigating the formation of high‐impedance interfaces. This tailored electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity, excellent oxidative stability, and broad temperature tolerance. When validated at 4.5 V, high‐loading NCM811/graphite cells achieve nearly full capacity over 100 cycles at low temperatures (−20 °C), with pouch cells retaining 80% of their capacity after 470 cycles. These findings underscore the effectiveness of strategic additive engineering in advancing the development of PC‐based electrolytes for practical LIBs.",

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with their unique structural tunability, redox properties, and high surface area have emerged as promising candidates for the OER process. In this work, a presentation on how linker functionalization in rather unexplored manganese‐based MOFs leads to enhanced OER activity is given. A series of manganese‐based MOFs in rarely reported MIL‐88B structure (Mn‐MIL‐88‐X) is synthesized using functionalized linkers [X = NH2, NO2, Br]. The objective is to modulate the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of the MOFs leading to enhanced OER activity. Among functionalized MOFs, Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 shows remarkable performance, requiring only 260 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1. The improvement in OER activity of Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 is ascribed to the higher oxidation states of manganese (Mn3+/Mn4+) and the presence of the amino group (‐NH2) as confirmed through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work paves the way for the designing and exploring of mixed‐valence state metal‐based MOFs as advanced electrode materials for electrocatalysis.",

To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the OCO angles and elongate the CO bonds, transforming CO2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual‐V and dual‐Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO2, leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu‐based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO2 utilization.",

In this work, a post‐mortem analysis of SnS2 electrodes was performed at pristine state, after the 1st cycle and at 80 % state‐of‐health. The analysis compared water‐based (Na‐CMC/SBR) and NMP‐based (PVDF) electrodes revealing insights into their degradation mechanisms and electrochemical performance. During the first cycle, SnS2 converts into Sn and Li2S identified by XRD, causing particle cracking and exfoliation. XPS and Raman spectroscopy identified Sn, SnFx, LiF, Li2S and carbonates species forming the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), while in‐situ dilatometry revealed up to 60 % irreversible expansion after the first cycle. These species are also found after at 80 % SOH along with an increase in fluorine species, SEI thickness and interfacial resistance. Water‐based electrodes exhibited better cycling stability, with 80 wt.% SnS2 and 10 wt.% binder retaining 80 % capacity after 180+ cycles. These findings underscore the critical role of binder choice and processing in enhancing SnS2 anodes’ durability and capacity retention, paving the way for sustainable, high‐performance LIB anodes.",

This work develops an in situ pore‐making approach to construct cross‐linked porous catalyst layer, which significantly improves catalyst active site utilization compared to conventional catalyst layer (CCL). The electrochemical activity area of the porous catalyst layer membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) (52.22 cm2 mgIr−1) is 2.10 times higher than that of the CCL‐MEA (24.90 cm2 mgIr−1), which indicates that more active sites are exposed during pore‐making process, leading to the higher utilization efficiency of the electrocatalyst. As a result, the porous catalyst layer exhibits a high current density of 3.8 A cm−2 at 1.9 V, which is exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 target (3 A cm−2@1.9 V), and shows superior durability with no significant degradation after 1600 h of operation at a constant load of 2 A cm−2. Scanning electron microscope analysis confirms the structural integrity of the porous catalyst layer, while cracks formed in the CCL during testing.

UPS and Kelvin probe results demonstrate an alteration of the Fermi level position in Ti‐doped BiVO4 depending on the dopant concentration.

Moreover, either anodic or cathodic behavior of heterostructured electrodes depends on the spatial layer‐by‐layer construction of the electrodes, that is, on the direction of the Fermi level gradient between heterostructure's components. Photoelectrochemical experiments performed with a tandem photoelectrochemical cell with two photoactive electrodes based on pristine and Ti(10 at%)‐doped BiVO4 demonstrate that stable photocurrent in the system is generated only when both photoelectrodes are photoexcited that confirms that the pre‐existing Fermi level gradient between the two electrodes induces the driving force for photoelectrochemical activity in the tandem cell.",

However, finding suitable electrolytes that are compatible with the metallic Mg electrode and enable highly reversible Mg plating is still challenging. Typical electrolytes for rechargeable magnesium batteries are based on ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME), or higher glymes. Drawbacks are the high volatilites and low flashpoints of THF and DME and their harmfulness, problematic factors for industrial applicability. One potential alternative is diethylene glycol diethyl ether (DEGDEE) which is also an ether, but has significantly higher boiling and flashpoints than THF and DME, and is from today's perspective less harmful than any of the previously mentioned solvents. To test the suitability and stability of this class of electrolytes, different Mg salts in combination with DEGDEE for their electrochemical Mg plating and stripping properties are studied. Although Mg deposition needs higher overpotentials than for their DME‐based counterparts, the investigated electrolytes enable reversible Mg plating with relatively high Coulombic efficiencies, making DEGDEE a promising alternative electrolyte solvent for rechargeable Mg batteries.",

Among various electrocatalysts, molecular catalysts, particularly transition metal complexes, stand out due to the high selectivity for single specific products and desirable tunability, enabling rational optimization of catalytic performance. However, their practical application is hindered by low operating current densities and challenges in catalyst recycling. To address these limitations, immobilizing molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces has emerged as an effective strategy for integrating selective molecular catalysts into heterogeneous catalysis. This mini review focuses on a distinct category of heterogenized molecular catalysts—those molecularly dispersed and supported on substrates or electrode surfaces‐which exhibit remarkable catalytic activity at the single‐molecule level and the ability to drive deep CO2 reduction (beyond two electrons) under certain conditions. Recent progress in this field is comprehensively discussed, emphasizing the critical impacts of molecule‐level dispersion and catalyst‐support interactions on electronic properties, multi‐electron transfer kinetics, and overall catalytic performance. Moreover, the overview of potential applications of supported molecular catalysts beyond electrochemical CO2R is provided at the end. This mini review aims to offer valuable insights for the future design of efficient and scalable electrocatalysts for sustainable CO2 conversion.",

    "abstract": "Nitrosobenzene (PhNO) is the central intermediary during the electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene in the presence of strong and moderately strong proton donors. Its reduction affords phenylhydroxylamine (PhNHOH) as product through a global mechanism involving the exchange of two electrons and two protons. During the analysis from weak to strong proton donors (acetic to trichloroacetic acids), the hydrogen bonding association with nitrosobenzene changes the reduction pathway from stepwise to concerted. The carboxylate ions that are released during the proton transfer steps associate with the phenylhydroxylamine and make its oxidation also concerted. These processes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, and the experimental voltammograms are simulated in the framework of a full mechanism in which the reduction steps as well as those of oxidation are considered. Information about the reliability of the association complexes involved in different steps is obtained from electronic structure calculations.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the critical durability challenges of direct liquid fuel cells using B/N‐H‐based fuels—decaborane (B10H14) and hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3)—for practical applications. Operational tests reveal significant performance degradation in both direct decaborane fuel cells (DDFCs) and direct hydrazine borane fuel cells (DHBFCs). In DDFCs, a severe 81.6% loss of initial peak power density occurs within 1 h, mainly attributed to the structural instability of the anode catalyst layer and cathode catalyst poisoning. For DHBFCs, a 46.4% performance decline is observed in the same period, with the accumulation of electrochemical byproducts at both electrodes being the primary cause. To address these issues, various optimization strategies are used. For DDFCs, replacing the anode substrate, adjusting the ionomer/carbon ratio, and using a more poison‐resistant cathode catalyst prove effective. In the case of DHBFCs, improving the anode gas diffusion layer and adopting AEMs significantly enhance performance. After optimization, DDFCs exhibit only a 6.7% performance degradation over 50 h of operation, while DHBFCs retain 95.7% of their initial performance. These findings provide crucial insights into the degradation mechanisms and optimization approaches for B/N‐H‐based fuel cell systems, facilitating their potential application in practical energy scenarios.",

The synthesis routines of this material class have been shown to allow for great tunability by varying the corresponding parameters. The control of crystal phase, defect, and water content, as well as electrochemical properties, have been studied extensively for the state‐of‐the‐art coprecipitation method. In turn, electrochemical deposition, which is particularly suited for thin‐film production, remains mainly underexplored. This study investigates the effects of synthesis temperature, scan rate, precursor concentration, and supporting electrolyte pH on nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) films electrodeposited onto a high surface area carbon‐based substrate via cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical analysis and morphological characterization reveal that higher deposition temperatures increase cation‐specific capacity, influence NiHCF coverage, and promote larger, more crystalline structures. Scan rate, precursor concentration, and pH variations further demonstrate the correlation between deposition parameters, crystallite size, and NiHCF structure. These findings highlight the tunability of electrodeposited PBAs for tailored electrochemical performance and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the durability of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is critical for advancing a hydrogen‐powered clean energy future. A major obstacle to improving PEMFC durability is reactive oxygen species (ROS) that deteriorate PEMFC performance by oxidizing membrane electrode assembly (MEA). While CeOx‐based nanomaterials are widely used as antioxidants, they often undergo decline in efficacy by their nanostructure deformation, hampering stable PEMFC operation. Here, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are reported as a stabilizer for antioxidants, effectively alleviating the CeOx disintegration. MSNs facilitate the formation of uniformly dispersed CeOx nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm having abundant oxygen vacancies and high proportion of Ce(III) oxidation states. The well‐defined mesoporous structure of MSNs effectively confines CeOx in the internal voids and prevents CeOx agglomeration, thereby exhibiting sustained antioxidation efficacy within the Pt/C‐based electrodes. Importantly, CeOx/MSN mitigates the MEA degradation, retaining 95% of PEMFC performance even after 100 h durability tests under the ROS‐rich environment.",

Using a combination of electrochemical methods, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and thermodynamic analyses, the solubility of these impurities, their influence on electrolyte decomposition, and their effect on NMC 811‐based positive electrodes are assessed. Our results indicate that the presence of transition metal contaminants accelerates electrolyte aging, leading to the formation of decomposition products such as HF, OPF2(OH), and OPF(OCH3)2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling reveal that these impurities contribute to increased charge transfer resistance and capacity fading. Notably, nickel‐based contaminants exhibit the strongest impact, likely due to their catalytic activity in side reactions. A detailed thermodynamic analysis further elucidates the reaction pathways responsible for the formation of these degradation products. This study highlights the complex interplay between electrolyte contamination, aging processes, and electrochemical performance, providing valuable insights into the stability of lithium‐ion battery electrolytes and the necessity of impurity control in battery recycling and material purification.",

However, their application is limited by the corrosivity of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid‐based electrolyte, which is currently the only type of electrolyte able to plate and strip Al efficiently. Despite there are several recent reviews discussing progress in the field of Al batteries, it is believed that it is also necessary to consider the challenges and the many failures often not presented in publications, which are required to further develop the technology. This review examines the technical challenges in developing RAB technologies, based on the direct experience of research group, emphasizing the critical role of selecting appropriate electrolytes, passive components, and cell setups for understanding and correctly assessing electrode material performance. RABs are still in their infancy and to build a comprehensive bibliography, technical challenges should be thoroughly documented and addressed.

Herein, a solid‐state potentiometric working/reference electrode system with a Bluetooth‐enabled system on a chip, supporting continuous wireless monitoring of microbial growth is shown. The sensor monitors open circuit potentials (OCPs) in culture media, which significantly decrease due to bacterial growth after inoculation with Gram‐positive Staphylococcus aureus, Gram‐negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Notably, Staphylococcus aureus demonstrates lower electrogenic activity compared with the Gram‐negative bacteria, likely owing to its reduced viability. Following thorough in vitro testing, the sensor is also evaluated ex vivo. Stable connections between the sensor and a smartphone receiver ensure reliable data collection and processing, facilitating remote monitoring. A slight decrease in OCP is observed in rat wounds inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and significant decrease with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Incorporation of the wireless sensing module for continuous measurement and data collection can greatly enhance early detection capabilities regarding bacterial infections in wounds. This setup offers a convenient and effective method for point‐of‐care sensing, significantly advancing the management and treatment of wound infections.",

    "abstract": "As a by‐product of biofuel production, glycerol needs to find its use in various applications, for example, as a substrate for electrosynthesis of more valuable chemicals. The glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in aqueous media is technologically feasible but produces various products with hard‐to‐control selectivity. Less explored is the electrooxidation of anhydrous glycerol, which theoretically limits possible products to aldehydes/ketones, including high‐cost glyceraldehyde. Herein, the GOR with gold electrodes is investigated using glycerol and acetonitrile as solvents without and with base, TEMPO (2,2,6,6‐tetramethylpiperidine 1‐oxyl) redox mediator, and a copper(I)‐bipyridyl catalyst added into the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide electrolyte solutions. Both redox‐mediated and heterogeneous oxidation are slow when glycerol is used as a solvent even at 90 °C, as in particular probed by Fourier‐transformed alternating current voltammetry. Redox‐mediated glycerol oxidation to glyceraldehyde is achieved in acetonitrile at a yield rate of 6 ± 3 nmol s−1 cm−2, but the reaction essentially stops after ≈1 h of electrolysis. Heterogeneous catalytic GOR in acetonitrile is more stable but requires significantly more positive potentials and produces a mix of products. While demonstrating the possibility of selective anhydrous glycerol electrooxidation, our results highlight the need for improvements in the mediator and catalyst designs.",

Despite the promising character of the presented concept, literature does not show any follow‐up study or successful reproduction of the results. The common denominator among all further studies that involve sulfide oxidation is the working electrode: The use of plain graphite instead of cobalt impregnated graphite results in irreversible electrode blockage by build‐up of elemental sulfur (S0). In this—purely abiotic—study, the electrochemical properties of cobalt‐deposited electrodes are investigated when brought in contact with sulfide‐containing solutions. This study thereby shows that cobalt acts as a catalyst accelerating the oxidation of S2− to higher oxidation products, thereby avoiding sulfur build‐up on the electrode surface. The sulfide oxidation can proceed directly at the cobalt oxide surface, or via a soaking and subsequent oxidation mechanism. In this process, the cobalt layer itself is “charged” by transformation to cobalt sulfide (CoS), which is subsequently “discharged” oxidatively resulting in the production of current. The insights presented here pave the way for a replication and utilization of the original results by Habermann and Pommer.",

This applies to the structronic (STR) electrochemical paradigm. Typically, when strategically positioned in space, electrophoric components within STR functional assemblies—featuring potent electrophilic centers (i.e., atomic orbitals with a significant contribution to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of their redox‐active components)—can engage in direct electronic interactions through σ‐type orbital overlap, creating a set of so‐called supra‐molecular orbitals (supra‐MOs). The core idea is to fill the potentially bonding supra‐LUMO with electrons, thereby storing them in the form of a weakened (elongated) reservoir bond. This approach bypasses electrostatic limitations by leveraging the quantum behavior of electrons within covalent bonds. STR assemblies are bistable systems that can be electrochemically cycled, allowing for the charging and discharging of stored electrons. This concept article aims to define the conditions necessary for generating these supra‐MOs, explore their electrochemical characteristics (such as hysteretic electrochemical behaviors and inversion of redox potentials), and highlight potential applications in advanced energy storage and other fields within the dynamic scope of electrochemistry.",

A complete structural investigation through neutron diffraction and thermal operando synchrotron X‐ray diffraction elucidates the phase evolution during oxidation. In coin cell tests against lithium, both samples demonstrate initial anodic capacities attributed to irreversible conversion reactions, followed by reversible alloying/dealloying mechanisms. Similarly, tests against sodium show comparable electrochemical behavior, albeit with lower capacities due to sodium's lower reactivity with Sn oxide. The capacity retention after cycling can be associated to the structural stability of the electrodes.

Using the same instrumental setup for SECCM and for atomic force microscopy (AFM), the locally formed SEI spots could be directly characterized with respect to the morphology, height, passivation and nanomechanical properties in dependence of the experimental deposition parameters such as scan rate and cycling number. In addition, time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS) in combination with AFM revealed the chemical composition of the SEI layer by recording spatially resolved 3D mass maps of the SEI spots. This combination of high‐resolution microscopic and spectrometric methods provides new insights into the dynamics of SEI formation as a function of the electrolyte and the experimental parameters.",

Most donor–acceptor‐type luminescent systems show solvent‐polarity sensitivity, which limits their applications. Herein, three alternate π‐conjugated biphenyl/terphenyl substituents are attached to the TTM unit. Results reveal that connection modes and types of benzene ring derivatives lead to distinct charge transfer (CT) and locally excited state hybrid emitters due to the differences in conjugation degree. All three radicals exhibit polarity‐insensitive red emission (626–690 nm), and their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) increase with solvent polarity. Specifically, linear‐conjugated TTM‐DPh has higher photostability but lower PLQY, while nonlinear‐conjugated TTM‐3DPh and TTM‐TPh have nearly 10‐fold higher PLQYs. The photophysical studies suggest that the conjugation degree and hybridization level between CT and ground states account for these properties.",

Herein, the successful synthesis of ≈2.6 nm AuPt alloy nanoparticles supported on MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures via in situ transformation of α‐MnO2 is reported. Selective aerobic photocatalytic glycerol oxidation toward value‐added C3 products has been achieved with AM 1.5G light irradiation under ambient conditions on these as synthesized 1 wt% AuPt/MnO2‐Mn3O4, which displays 2.3 and 6.5 times enhancement compared to that of AuPt/Mn3O4 and AuPt/MnO2. A 74% overall C3 product selectivity (60% in terms of glyceric acid) has been achieved at 75% glycerol conversion after 4 h of photocatalytic reaction. Investigation results reveal that the formation of MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures combines the local photothermal heating (primarily on MnO2) synergistically with the photochemical catalysis (on Mn3O4), thus achieving enhanced photocatalytic glycerol oxidation. This study may provide guidance for future catalyst design, where photon‐driven photocatalysis with phonon‐driven photothermal effect can be seamlessly integrated to achieve maximal solar energy utilization and high photocatalytic efficiency.",

Among photochemical techniques, photopolymerization stands out as a rapid, controlled, and eco‐friendly approach, making it particularly suitable for applications like 3D printing. This research in two‐photon‐induced photopolymerization for 3D microfabrication led to groundbreaking performance, thanks to the use of custom π‐extended molecular architectures as photoinitiators. Building on these results, a photoactivable initiation system for photoinduced‐atom transfer radical polymerization (photoATRP) is now reported using a similar π‐extended photoinitiator. Through comprehensive optimization, we successfully created a functional multicomponent photoinitiating system, with its detailed mechanism thoroughly established in solution. By covalently attaching alkyl halides to glass surfaces, we were able to implement the surface‐induced photo‐ATRP technique to create customized brush polymer architectures. This work not only advances the understanding of photoATRP mechanisms but also introduces new strategies for functional surface engineering, with potential applications in two‐photon‐induced surface modification of 3D/4D structures via photoATRP.",

Switches based on 2‐pyridyl‐ or 2‐pyridylmethyl‐containing N‐components exhibit strong fluorescence in their protonated Z‐configurations, compared to their phenyl/benzyl counterparts.

They have been extensively investigated in material sciences for numerous applications. The synthesis of cyanine dyes with various functional groups on the methine chain has attracted significant attention because it significantly alters the properties of the dye. However, few synthetic methods have been reported for directly introducing groups onto the methine chains of cyanine dyes. Ketone functional groups are essential in synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials chemistry. However, there are no reports on the direct introduction of ketone groups into cyanine dyes. Trifluoroacetylation is performed on the methine chains of polymethine cyanine dyes. This is achieved by directly using anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid to synthesize trifluoroacetylated trimethine, pentamethine, and heptamethine cyanine dyes in good yields. Single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis is performed to determine the substitution positions in the synthesized dyes. The results reveal that trifluoroacetylation of the methine chain shortens the maximum absorption wavelength and decreases the molar absorption coefficient in dichloromethane solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) film compared to an unsubstituted cyanine dye, and decreases the fluorescence quantum yield. This study highlights the unique properties of trifluoroacetylated polymethine cyanine dyes.",

It is found that the BO overlayer forms BO nanoislands after annealing. Under visible light illumination, BMO with BO nanoislands results in a nearly tenfold increase of the current density compared to pristine BMO at the same applied potential. This increased performance is related to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and in the amount of recombinations based on the formation of a favorable heterojunction between BMO and BO.

    "abstract": "Recent advances with luminescent mononuclear chromium(III) complexes have provided important molecular design guidelines for enhancing their photoluminescence properties. Applying these modern aspects of coordination chemistry to dinuclear CrIII complexes, which are mostly not luminescent but show interesting magnetic properties, seems attractive for exploring functional coordination compounds with magnetic exchange interactions and light‐induced activity. In this concept, the key structural requirements for dinuclear CrIII complexes with ferromagnetic exchange interactions and with photoluminescence properties, respectively, are analyzed. Rational merger of these key magneto‐optical–structural correlations leads to new types of dinuclear CrIII complexes with ferromagnetic coupling and room temperature luminescence, and their photophysical properties make them promising photosensitizers for energy transfer. These design concepts open the door of exploring novel dinuclear CrIII complexes, which can allow the crosstalk of photophysics, photochemistry, and magnetic exchange interactions.",

    "abstract": "Altering the manner in which groups are connected could offer a straightforward approach to achieving different functionality. Herein, heterotetraarylene molecules with varying bond‐linked quinoline moieties are synthesized and designed to investigate their differential performances. The heterotetraarylene with carbon‐carbon double bonded quinolines exhibits multifunctional properties: 1) all‐visible light‐induced photochromism, 2) acidochromism, and 3) acid–base gated photoswitch. Simultaneously, it achieves dual‐mode fluorescence modulation through both photoexcitation and acid/base stimuli. However, the heterotetraarylene and quinoline connected by carbon carbon single bonds exhibit divergent properties, including light‐induced emission enhancement and solvent‐dependent fluorescence emission. This bond‐selective functional divergence enables precise customization of stimulus‐responsive fluorescence through simple connectivity control, establishing a novel design paradigm for smart molecular systems. Furthermore, the heterotetraarylene‐linked quinolines with carbon carbon double bonds exhibit many properties, thus allowing for the construction of a new dual‐responsive encryption system.",

A series of Nb2O5 photocatalysts are prepared using a simple thermal approach, and their photocatalytic performance for HMF oxidation is tested. Nb2O5 treated at relatively lower temperatures (300–400 °C) possesses a higher surface area with abundant surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water species, which play a key role in the HMF oxidation, affording high DFF selectivity. In contrast, Nb2O5 treated at higher temperatures (500–600 °C) exhibits an adverse effect on the photocatalytic performance due to the substantial loss of surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water species. Various structural characterizations such as X‐ray diffractometer, N2‐sorption analyses, and thermogravimetric analyser Nb2O5 treated at different temperatures. At the same time, CO2‐temperature programmed desorption (TPD), O2–TPD, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra disclose the nature and distribution of active sites, especially strong basic sites, which is essential for comprehending the interaction between HMF and the surface of the catalyst.",

Herein, a strategy is reported for achieving higher quantum yields of NIR‐light‐driven photocatalytic H2 production using salts of diprotonated dodecaphenylporphyrin (H4DPP2+(X−)2), showing large saddle distortion as organic photosensitizers and platinum nanoparticles as catalysts. When a perchlorate ion (ClO4−) is employed as a counter ion (X−) of H4DPP2+(X−)2, the quantum yield of the photocatalytic H2 production reaches to 36% by excitation at 750 nm, which is the highest value among those of NIR‐light‐driven H2 production reported so far. Such a drastic enhancement of the quantum yield is achieved by selection of X− as an appropriate counter anion of H4DPP2+, judging from second‐order rate constants of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from electron donors to 3(H4DPP2+(X−)2)* and the reorganization energy of ET for H4DPP2+(X−)2.",

Our temperature‐dependent PL investigations unveiled pronounced mid‐gap emission peaks within the UV (380–468 nm) and visible (490–550 nm) regions, indicative of excitonic behavior. Notably, the S2 composite exhibited enhanced PL intensity and extended carrier lifetimes across all studied temperatures, attributed to effective suppression of surface states via d‐electron hopping. Complementary high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses further corroborated the presence of surface defects and d‐electron hopping mechanisms, elucidating their pivotal roles in enhancing PL emission characteristics.

The activity was further enhanced, by incorporating copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) through an impregnation method, where the optimal loading of 0.01 mol% surpassed the activity of the benchmark photocatalyst TiO2 P25, with ~22 % NO and ~9 % NOx removal under visible light and ~40 % NO and ~23 % NOx under UV light.

The CO and CH4 yields of sample Cu1TB‐1.5 under visible light are 5.72 and 0.02 μmol g−1 h−1, wherein the CO yield was 15.5 times that of sample TB; its selectivity is 99.6%, and the cycling stability is excellent. OVs can broaden the light absorption of TB to the visible light region, and Cu promotes photoinduced electron transfer from TB to the Cu species and act as an active center. The OVs and Cu can synergistically enhance charge separation, CO2 adsorption, and CO2 conversion. The Cu1TB‐1.5 facilitates the formation of the intermediate COOH* during the photocatalytic process, thus improving the yield and selectivity of CO.

This study investigates how the physicochemical properties of Pd nanoparticles and support characteristics influence the continuous process performance including FA conversion, evolved gas flow rate, total hydrogen production, and catalyst durability. Pd catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation using various precursors, powdered supports, and Pd loadings and evaluated in a fixed‐bed reactor. The findings reveal that Pd/AC catalysts prepared with PdCl₂ precursor and nanopowdered AC are the most efficient. Strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged PdCl₄2⁻ species and the positively charged AC surface during impregnation enhance nanoparticle support interactions, resulting in small (∼2 nm), highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles with a high Pd2⁺/Pd⁰ atomic surface ratio. Metal dispersion is the dominant factor influencing hydrogen production, surpassing the effects of both particle size and electronic state. Higher Pd loadings also increased catalyst durability, reducing regeneration frequency. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Pd/AC catalysts, paving the way for efficient FA utilization as a hydrogen carrier.",

The photocatalyst is a pyrene dione (PD) molecule that has a significant absorbance in the visible light spectrum and can afford a persistent semiquinonate radical owing to the π‐delocalized pyrene backbone. This semiquinonate radical conducts hydrogen atom transfer reactions to facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions of a large number of alcohols. Leveraging on the dehydrogenating ability of PD that easily conducts 2e−/2H+ redox shuttles, olefination reaction was conducted on heteroarene methyl, fluorenes under mild conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic process works under aerobic conditions since oxygen regenerates the catalyst. The methodological development is a significant improvement over many transition metal catalysts for this task, which often work at high temperature and anaerobic reaction conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe impact of agitation on protein aggregation is often misattributed to shear stress rather than related phenomena such as cavitation and gas entrainment from the surface. For some time now, it has been known that shear is unlikely to harm most proteins directly. Rather, interfacial phenomena, particularly those involving dynamic gas‐liquid interfaces are critical contributors to protein damage, which leads to aggregation and compromises stability. This work investigated the kinetic stability of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase (HMFO; EC: 1.1.3.47) in a 2 L stirred tank reactor. Exposure experiments revealed that the leading cause of enzyme deactivation was exposure to the gas‐liquid interface, either produced deliberately when sparging gas into the system or by accidental air entrainment from the overhead space due to mechanical stirring. This was further proven by experiments using the Bio Thrust membrane module, which enabled bubble‐free aeration thus, confirming that exposure to the gas‐liquid interface is the leading cause of deactivation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA novel strategy to synthesize micro‐structured cobaltite (ACo2O4; A = Fe, Mn, Cu) catalysts with tunable catalytic properties exhibiting highly selective production of glycerol carbonate via urea glycerolysis reaction is demonstrated. FeCo2O4 microcubes, MnCo2O4 microspheres, and CuCo2O4 micro‐octahedrons were produced via an ultrasonication‐assisted hydrothermal approach. The impact of urea (U), semicarbazide (S) as structure directing agents (SDAs), and metal ion substitution (A = Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+) on catalyst morphology and acid–base active sites in cobaltite is confirmed using various material characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The enhanced catalytic properties resulted in a significant improvement in their catalytic performance, particularly in terms of activity and selectivity. The order of yield (Y) and selectivity (S) for GC production is FeCo2O4‐U microcubes (Y95 ± 3%, S99%) > MnCo2O4‐S microspheres (Y91.5 ± 3%, S98.5%) > CuCo2O4‐S micro‐octahedrons (Y83.4 ± 3%, S92.4%) > Co3O4 (Y35 ± 3%, 99%), as determined using the GC‐MS analysis. This performance is attributed to the effective catalytic activation of urea, leading to enhanced GC production via the isocyanic acid pathway. Therefore, the strategies presented in this work could be further extended to other spinel compounds to achieve desired catalytic properties for chemical transformations of industrial interest.",

This study introduces a dynamic ML‐guided approach that iteratively optimizes experimental parameters through successive cycles of ML analysis and experimentation, effectively circumventing the need for large datasets. Applied to the synthesis of photocatalysts via microwave heating of quercetin, this method yielded optimal performance after three iterations, achieving a high hydrogen peroxide production rate.

Improving hydrophilicity has been found to address this issue. CoFeCr LDH/NF, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with good hydrophilicity and a nanoflower structure, is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Hydrophilicity affects the size of bubbles produced, with better hydrophilic electrodes generating smaller, more easily disrupted bubbles. The cavitation effect upon bubble rupture releases heat, breaking water molecules to produce free OH⁻ and promoting the reconstruction of CoFeCr LDH. Additionally, the nanoflower structure of CoFeCr LDH features numerous micropores, enhancing the surface roughness of NF, and resulting in more uniform bubble sizes. Solution convection induced by ultrasound gathers small bubbles into larger ones, which are more easily removed by ultrasound. At 30 mA cm−2, ultrasound reduces the overpotential for HER and OER by 17 mV and 16 mV, respectively. Enhanced hydrophilicity significantly improves the efficiency of CoFeCr LDH/NF in water electrolysis, especially in OER.",

Iridium catalysts promoted TH reactions have been widely studied; however, examples of TH to CO2 are very scarce. In our search for the development of new and more efficient catalysts, we have studied the ability of [IrCp*(QO)X] complexes (QO = 8‐oxyquinolinate) to promote TH to bicarbonate salts and CO2 to obtain formate salts. The study shows a crucial ligand effect, obtaining the best results when [IrCp*(5,7‐Me,Me‐QO)Cl] was employed. Under optimized conditions, TON values up to 135 and 60 were obtained for TH to bicarbonate salts, and CO2, respectively.

B@CP achieved the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at potentials of 1.31 V and 1.40 V, respectively. Adding borophene to the catalyst also modified its morphology and charge transport, enhancing the UOR kinetics, reducing the charge transfer resistance, and exposing more electrochemically active sites. Moreover, B@CP displayed long‐term UOR stability for 50 h.

The precursor for the skeleton catalyst is a binary magnesium–nickel fluoride solid solution (MgF2–NiF2), synthesized using the precipitation method from magnesium nitrate, nickel nitrate, and ammonium fluoride. Upon reduction at 500 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere, only nickel fluoride is reduced, while magnesium fluoride maintains its structure unchanged, forming the structural framework for nickel nanoparticles. The catalyst achieves a specific surface area of up to 87.2 m2g−1 and a nickel metal surface area of up to 3.06 m2g−1. The most active catalyst, containing 73.1 wt.% Ni can convert 73% of CO2 to methane, with a selectivity of nearly 98% and a carbon balance of 0.98 at 400 °C, under high GHSV = 20,000 h−1. Among the factors contributing to the high catalytic activity, the metallic surface area measured by hydrogen chemisorption, the content of metallic nickel, and the amount of hydroxyl groups were identified. A strong correlation with catalytic activity was also observed for the surface composition of the catalysts determined by XPS, including: (1) total nickel content, (2) metallic nickel content, (3) oxygen content, and (4) the atomic Ni/Mg ratio. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between the activity and the surface basicity of the catalysts as measured by the CO2‐TPD method.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSulfonic acid group functionalized materials with Brønsted acid sites play a key role in the catalytic conversion of oxygen‐containing compounds with α─O─4 bonds to high‐carbon phenolic compounds. However, it is challenging to generate high‐carbon phenolic compounds with high selectivity due to the limited number of sulfonic acid groups grafted on the carrier and the difficulty in regulating the acid strength. This study utilizes concentrated sulfuric acid to sulfonate poly‐divinylbenzene to obtain sulfonated polymer nanotube catalysts with Brønsted acid sites. Their acid strength was regulated simply by controlling the sulfonation time. The π─π conjugation of the benzene rings in the polymer backbone and the electron‐withdrawing action of sulfonic acid groups alter the electron cloud density of the C─S bond, leading to the dissociation of H+ from sulfonic acid groups. This mechanism facilitates the highly selective alkylation of benzyloxybenzene, yielding bicyclic phenolic compounds, specifically 2‐benzylphenol and 4‐benzylphenol. The optimal material (SPDVB‐14) completely converts benzyloxybenzene into phenolic compounds under mild conditions (140 °C, 0.2 MPa N2, and 1.5 h), achieving a yield of up to 87.5% for both 2‐benzylphenol and 4‐benzylphenol. These high‐carbon phenolic compounds have potential application value in diesel/jet fuel and liquid organic hydrogen carriers.",

Thanks to its bi‐stability, this complex enables the evaluation of its catalytic activity in both the high‐spin (HS) and low‐spin (LS) states under identical experimental conditions, thereby clearly distinguishing the effects of the spin state from other variables. A notable increase in catalytic efficiency is observed from the low‐spin to the high‐spin state, with the high‐spin complex promoting up to 1.7 times more acetal formation. Extensive experiments across multiple batches of the complex confirm that these findings are both reproducible and representative. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we assessed the activation energy of the process. The activation energies for both spin states were found to be comparable, suggesting that the observed difference in catalytic activity is not due to electronic factors that stabilize the transition state, but rather to easier access to the catalytic active sites in the high‐spin state. This work represents a significant advancement toward developing a switchable catalytic system based on spin‐crossover phenomena, highlighting that the catalytic activity of SCO complexes can be effectively tuned by the spin state of the metal.",

Herein, we have synthesized a urea‐linked covalent organic framework (TFPTA‐BDU COF) by condensation polymerization. Then Zn (II) ions were impregnated on the N‐rich TFPTA‐BDU COF. The resulting Zn@TFPTA‐BDU COF was obtained. It was characterized by FT‐IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), PXRD (powder X‐ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), EDAX (energy dispersive X‐ray analysis), HR‐TEM (high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy), BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller), and XPS (X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Zn@TFPTA‐BDU COF demonstrates commendable yields (i.e., 54%–88% yields) in CO2 carbonylative coupling reactions, even under mild conditions. On the other hand, this newly synthesized catalyst also showed excellent performance in solvent‐free, room‐temperature oxazolidinones synthesis (with a yield of more than 90%) under sustainable conditions. Additionally, the as‐synthesized microporous COF catalyst demonstrated remarkable durability and can be recycled up to five times without any noticeable loss of its catalytic performance, indicating a true heterogeneous nature, highlighting its reusability, and making it a sustainable and cost‐effective solution.

A urea‐assisted deposition approach was employed to deposit noble metal nanoparticles uniformly on CeO2 without stabilizers, preserving the support's crystallinity and enhancing reducibility through strong metal‐support interactions. Catalytic tests at 550 °C over 24 h revealed significant differences in activity and the products distribution based on the metal used. Rh/CeO2 demonstrated the highest performance, achieving complete ethanol conversion and 37.75% hydrogen production, attributed to its efficient C─C and C─H bond cleavage. Pt/CeO2 and Ru/CeO2 also displayed high activity and stability, whereas Pd/CeO2 and Au/CeO2 primarily produced acetaldehyde due to preferential C─H bond scission. Post‐reaction analysis confirmed minimal carbon deposition across all catalysts, with Rh/CeO2 exhibiting the highest resistance to coke formation. These findings emphasize the importance of noble metal choice and metal‐support interactions in optimizing catalyst performance. Rh, Pt, and Ru emerged as the most promising candidates for efficient hydrogen production.

Combining phosphoric acid doping experiments with catalytic performance tests and several spectroscopic techniques, active sites could be identified. It is shown that the sites consist of coordinatively unsaturated Lewis acid V4+ centers and Brønsted acid P─OH groups that are connected by V─O─P bridging bonds. Phosphorus blocks these sites but does not alter their chemical nature. Catalytic performance tests correlate with spectroscopic results, demonstrating a direct relationship between the proposed active site structure and the catalytic behavior. It is suggested that the active sites exist in the previously identified amorphous surface layer on the crystalline vanadyl pyrophosphate probably formed by VOPO4 species as proposed in the literature. The data show that only about 11% of the catalyst surface is catalytically active, making earlier active site suggestions based on crystallographic considerations of vanadyl pyrophosphate unlikely. At high phosphorus loadings, the β‐VO(PO3)2 phase forms which has a known increased intrinsic activity but lower selectivity to maleic anhydride. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the maleic anhydride catalyst functionality.",

Subsequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) Eon and fill factor of the Cu2O photocathode have been improved by constructing buried heterojunctions, which positively shifts it's HER Eon to 0.91 V versus RHE. The tandem device achieves a solar‐to‐hydrogen efficiency of 5.42%, a result of the matched Eon between the semitransparent CsPbBr3 photoanode and the Cu2O photocathode.

Here we present a one‐pot two‐step cascade reaction in which phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPAD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid, followed by O‐methylation of the intermediate phenolic styrenes by resveratrol O‐methyltransferase from Vitis vinifera (VvROMT).

Characterization of variants with amino acid substitution in the active‐site cavity led to the identification of variants without activity toward the four phenolic acids. This avoids undesired O‐methylation of the starting material, which is not desirable since the decarboxylase does not convert the formed p‐methoxyphenolic acids. Furthermore, variation of amino acids in the active site led to the identification of variants with improved activity for all four phenolic styrenes.

In this work, the self‐supported LIG‐NiCuP electrode, utilizing a porous laser‐induced graphene (LIG) skeleton as the substrate and loaded with NiCuP compound, is designed for the efficient and highly selective electrooxidation of HMF to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The surface reconstruction of electrode forms a LIG‐NiCuP/NiCu(OH)x heterostructure, demonstrating high activity (HMF conversion 99.7%, FDCA yield 92.6%) for HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR). Studies indicate that the low activity of Cu for OER allows it to function as a co‐catalyst, enhancing the selectivity of Ni‐based primary catalyst for HMF. In addition, the pine needle‐like structure introduced by Cu can optimize the morphology of catalyst deposited on the LIG skeleton, increasing the contact area with HMF. On the other hand, from the point view of the substrate to support metal catalysts, the fabrication of LIG combines the characteristics of rapidity, simplicity, scalability, and low cost, therefore, holding high promise in practical applications.

In this study, we expand on the use of surfactant‐controlled reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of furfural on Pd/TiO2. In particular, the presence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the methanol prepared catalysts, shifts product selectivity for furfural hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), resulting from restricted diffusion away from the Pd nanoparticle surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate how solid‐state NMR is able to study the surfactant‐catalyst interaction and how these can be correlated to the selectivity profile for furfural hydrogenation.",

Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, which has a lowest overpotential of 232.54 mV with a Tafel slope of 144.85 mV·dec−1 and excellent stability. The improved performance of the HES electrocatalyst can be attributed to the surface morphology optimization, improved conductivity, and enhanced entropy stability brought about by the adjustment of Cu content. In addition, the synergistic effect between metal elements improves the intrinsic activity and active site exposure of the catalyst, and the uniformity and surface consistency of the catalyst also enhance its stability. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for the preparation and application of HES electrocatalysts but also provides a new path for the development of energy conversion and storage technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZn‐containing ZSM‐5 zeolite is extensively utilized as a catalyst for light hydrocarbons aromatization reactions due to its excellent catalytic performance. Nevertheless, the enduring stable operation of Zn‐modified ZSM‐5 zeolite catalysts faces obstacles posed by carbon deposition and the loss of Zn species during the reaction process. The accumulation of coke on the zeolite catalysts during the aromatization of light hydrocarbons is influenced by the aromatization reaction pathway, the structural attributes of the zeolite (pore channels, acidity), and the evolution of Zn species. The state of Zn species in zeolite catalysts is influenced by the preparation method, reaction atmosphere, and carbon deposition process. The depletion of active Zn species impacts not only the catalytic performance in aromatization but also the stability of the catalysts. In light of this, this paper reviews the reaction pathways of Zn/ZSM‐5 zeolite catalysts for the aromatization of light hydrocarbons, strategies for Zn retention, countermeasures against Zn loss, carbon deposition, and methods to mitigate carbon deposition. Given the current state of research on aromatization catalysts, it is advisable to prioritize the incorporation of anticarbon deposition and anti‐Zn loss attributes in future research and development endeavors. Such an approach holds the promise of yielding highly selective and stable catalysts for light hydrocarbons aromatization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe electrocatalytic oxidation of urea (UOR) at near‐theoretical potentials presents a promising approach for efficient urea energy conversion. A critical challenge lies in enhancing the compatibility between the active sites and the multiple intermediates of UOR to accelerate urea dehydrogenation kinetics, thereby overcoming the high overpotential barrier of urea oxidation. Herein, we propose a strategy to enhance d–p orbital hybridization via bimetallic doping and develop a silver/cobalt (ACO/NS) co‐doped nickel sulfide‐based self‐supporting composite catalyst. The synergistic interaction between the bimetallic oxide and nickel sulfide heterojunction regulates d–p orbital hybridization, redistributes charge, and optimizes the adaptability of the Ni site energy levels to better match urea and various intermediates. This promotes efficient electron coupling and dehydrogenation processes with OH⁻. Experimental results demonstrate that ACO/NS exhibits outstanding urea oxidation activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.04 V (versus RHE) and maintaining stable activity over 168 h. Theoretical analysis combined with experimental findings reveals a microscopic reaction mechanism at low potentials: the enhanced d–p hybridization induced by bimetallic doping modulates the adsorption strength of OH* and urea, thereby accelerating the dehydrogenation kinetics of urea oxidation. This work highlights the feasibility of achieving near‐theoretical potential urea oxidation through the systematic modulation and optimization of catalysts, providing valuable insights for the development of high‐performance catalytic systems.",

In this study, we developed a practical and single‐step scalable approach for activating porous 3D‐printed electrodes (3DPE) using heat treatment. Interestingly, an interconnected particle morphology with uniform pores (149.4 ± 70.2 nm) evolved in ammonia tread 3DPE, which was absent in the argon environment‐activated electrode. Also, the enhanced anodic/cathodic ion diffusion coefficient from Ar‐300 (1.26 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) to Am‐300 (1.659 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) signified the active participation of the macropore in the presence of inner redox probe (ferro/ferricyanide). The improved electron transfer rates of 5.36 × 10−4 and 2.79 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 were observed in the Am‐300 and Ar‐300 electrodes, respectively. The activated Am‐300 support electrode showed an OER activation overpotential of 466 mV and 686 mV under N2‐saturated 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The notable activity of the Am‐300 electrodes has been attributed to the combined effect of enhanced electronic conductivity, high density of macro/mesoporosity, and remarkable modulation of the double layer capacitance (Cdl), which enabled higher accessibility of reactant. The electrode activation strategy developed in the present study can provide a simple and scalable approach toward developing a free‐standing electrode and its direct impact on the active site support for the pH‐neutral OER catalysts.",

Finally, their catalytic activity in toluene combustion was tested, as well as stability under variable humidity of a purified gas.

In this study, we have explored the ilmenite‐type Co‐substituted NiTiO3 as a promising OER catalyst in the alkaline electrolyte.

An outer‐sphere mechanism is proposed that involves nucleophilic addition of a Ru phosphido ligand to the alkene and subsequent proton transfer to the resulting phospha‐carbanion from Ru‐bound substrate phosphine. Selected kinetic studies and the observation of catalyst resting state complexes that inevitably contain both a reactive phosphido ligand and substrate phosphine suggest that the conjugate addition is turnover limiting. However, analysis of catalyst activities as a function of the alkene activating group, and observation of off‐cycle alkene oligomerization initiated by the phospha‐carbanion intermediate for some alkene and phosphine substrates point to a more complex situation. These results suggest that alkenes that are “too” activated or substrate phosphines that are not sufficiently P─H acidic cause the intramolecular proton transfer to become turnover‐limiting, with rates sensitive to the conjugate addition “pre‐equilibrium”. This unusual compilation of experimental evidence for the impact of substrate variation on the activity and selectivity of a hydrophosphination catalyst provides insights for guiding future catalyst (re)design, including the challenge of providing a coordination environment that enhances phosphine P─H acidity to achieve a broader substrate phosphine scope.",

Au‐based catalysts offer greater selectivity than Pd but are limited by poor hydrogen activation. Alloying Au with Cu offers a promising approach to enhance catalytic performance by improving activity while retaining excellent selectivity. The structural dynamics of TiO₂‐supported monometallic (Au, Cu) and bimetallic (AuCu, AuCu3) catalysts were investigated during the reduction step where metal nanoparticles are structured, and the selective hydrogenation of butadiene, using operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). XANES investigation shows that the temperature at which both metal precursors are reduced during the reduction step is strongly influenced by the alloy composition. This is explained by a Au0 assisted reduction of Cu2+ species mediated by H2 spillover. EXAFS shows that Au maintains its metallic state during the catalytic reaction, while Cu shows minor electronic changes without forming segregated CuO phases. EXAFS also indicate a synergistic effect in AuCu/TiO2 catalyst. STEM‐HAADF investigation reveals that the crystalline structure of AuCu nanoparticles after reaction is more robust against size‐dependent structural changes compared to pure Au, suggesting that alloying Cu with Au plays a role in the nanoparticle's stability.",

Interrelationships of the active phase and catalysis of the Cu/Bi/SiO2 pre‐catalysts could be concluded by varying copper loading (optimum 35 wt.%), bismuth promoter concentration (optimum 4 wt.%), and pre‐catalyst calcination procedure. The formation rate, amount, and dispersion of Cu2C2 determine the reaction rate and yield of BYD, thus bridging the former gap between copper oxide pre‐catalysts and the actual active cuprous acetylide phase.",

This reaction accounts for two steps: hydroformylation from the alkene, followed by aldehyde reductive amination. Acid sites exposed at the surface of the support promote the formation of a metal‐alkene coordination complex to preferentially form the linear aldehyde. Synthetic and natural olefins were converted with yields up to 99% under mild conditions (120 °C, 40 bar of syngas, 4 h). With the addition of catalytic amounts of acetic acid, the hydroformylation step proceeded with a 99% yield over both catalysts. The catalysts were recovered and reused, maintaining their activity for three reaction cycles (12 h). The hydroaminomethylation step again gave yields up to 99%, using 1‐hexene as substrate (120 °C, 4 h, 40 bar of N2/H2 1:1). Subsequent tests with different nitrogen sources resulted in amine yields ranging from 56% to 99%, even with ammonia.

However, the unavailability of cost‐effective, stable, and efficient anode materials continues to hamper the large‐scale commercialization of DFAFCs. Herein, we report a simple, easily scalable, one‐pot hydrothermal strategy for the synthesis of nanoscale palladium phosphide (PdP) loaded three‐dimensional nitrogen‐doped graphene (3D‐NrGO/PdP) composites as a potential anode electrocatalyst for formic acid electro‐oxidation (FAEO). The stability and electrocatalytic activity of 3D‐NrGO/PdP are shown to be strongly composition sensitive, with 3D‐NrGO/PdP(2:1) (Pd:P ratio of 2:1) composite exhibiting the highest activity, stability, and tolerance to higher concentrations of formic acid under DFAFCs relevant conditions. The exceptionally high electrochemically active surface area, high electronic conductivity, and positive synergism among the components of optimally composed 3D‐NrGO/PdP(2:1) composite are demonstrated to endow it with excellent electrochemical stability, low resistance to charge transfer, and hence high electrocatalytic performance toward FAEO. The excellent stability and electrocatalytic performance (mass activity) as observed for the 3D‐NrGO/PdP(2:1) composite in the present work is far better than those reported till date for FAEO.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNickel phosphide nanoparticles are used as catalysts in a wide range of chemical transformations such as hydrogenation. However, the synthesis of colloidal dispersion of these nanoparticles usually requires high reaction temperature and oleylamine as a reducing agent, which compromises the surface reactivity of the nanocatalysts. This work reports a robust new method of the synthesis of nickel phosphide nanoparticles assisted by H2 and at a lower temperature of 200 °C. Well‐crystallized Ni12P5 and Ni2P nanoparticles of 5.5 ± 0.5 nm were successfully prepared using tri‐n‐octylphosphine (TOP) as the phosphorus source. They were characterized by X‐ray diffraction and high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy. A higher temperature, reaction time, and TOP/Ni ratio favored the formation of a Ni2P phase over Ni12P5.These nanoparticles were used as catalysts for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. At high temperatures (80 and 100 °C), they allowed the full conversion of phenylacetylene to ethylbenzene. Interestingly, they were also active in the lower temperature regime, at 30 °C or even 0 °C, where significant conversions were obtained as soon as at least 0.1 equiv of tri‐n‐butylphopshine was added as a co‐catalyst, and styrene was the major product. The activity of this nanocatalyst in the low‐temperature regime outperformed that reported for other nickel phosphide nanoparticles with similar size, but prepared in the presence of oleylamine. This work highlights the relevance of H2‐assisted synthesis for the production of nanocatalysts active at temperatures below 30 °C.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOwing to the abundance of seawater, hydrogen production via direct seawater electrolysis is a promising technology for sustainable energy production. However, the construction of efficient and durable catalysts and their application in seawater electrolysis remains a considerable challenge. Here, the precursor of NiFe‐based Prussian blue analogs (NiFe PBA) was synthesized in situ on a corrosion‐resistant nickel sulfide substrate, followed by phosphating to successfully preparing a core‐shell transition metal phosphide/sulfide (Ni3S2@CoFe‐P) catalyst. The prepared Ni3S2@CoFe‐P catalyst obtained overpotentials of 75 and 153 mV in alkaline (1 M KOH) and alkaline seawater (1 M KOH + seawater) at 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The excellent HER performance of the catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect between the heterogeneous interfaces of Ni3S2@CoFe‐P, which can effectively optimize the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst and accelerate the electron transfer. Meanwhile, the core‐shell structure exposes abundant active sites. In addition, the Ni3S2@CoFe‐P catalyst was able to operate smoothly in seawater for 100 h due to the inherent corrosion resistance of metal phosphides. This work offers a viable approach to design high‐performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.",

Notably, this method enables the derivatization of the important drug molecule Dapson, showcasing its practical utility. The catalyst also allows both selective monoalkylation and dialkylation of a broad range of aniline derivatives using aliphatic diols as alkylating agents. This method provides the corresponding alkylated amines in excellentyields, typically between 81% to 99%, thereby underscoring its efficiency.

However, the lack of efficient and stable anode catalysts remains a critical obstacle to commercialization.

These catalysts feature a unique multilayered nanosheet structure, which provides abundant active sites and high electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs). Among the synthesized catalysts, Pd₄Pt₁ NSA demonstrates exceptional mass activities of 2310 mA mg⁻¹ for MOR and 2260 mA mg⁻¹ for EOR, surpassing commercial Pd/C by 7.62‐fold and 4.09‐fold, respectively. The superior performance arises from three synergistic factors: (i) Electronic modulation via ligand effects (electron transfer between Pd and Pt) and strain effects (lattice expansion with minimal Pd‐Pt lattice mismatch ≤ 0.77%), which collectively optimize intermediate adsorption; (ii) Enhanced ECSAs enabled by the ultrathin, high‐surface‐area nanosheet assemblies; (iii) Structural robustness of the interconnected nanosheet network, ensuring long‐term stability.

The materials were calcined and reduced to evaluate their catalytic performance in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin, a representative lignin‐derived compound. Catalytic tests performed in a batch reactor at 533 K and 3.92 MPa H₂ demonstrated that the Ni/Al = 3 catalyst exhibited superior activity, achieving full vanillin conversion and 79% selectivity toward fully deoxygenated products, namely methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane. Characterization by XRD, TPR, and XPS revealed that the coexistence of metallic Ni⁰ particles and oxygen vacancies was critical in enhancing both hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions. Notably, the presence of anionic vacancies allowed for heterolytic H₂ dissociation and hydride formation, contributing to high catalytic efficiency even in the absence of surface‐exposed Ni⁰. The Ni–Al interaction modulated the electronic environment and reducibility of the active sites, influencing product selectivity and catalytic stability. Recycling experiments confirmed the catalyst’s structural robustness over three consecutive cycles. This study demonstrates that tuning the Ni/Al ratio in LDH‐derived mixed oxides enables the design of stable and bifunctional catalysts with synergistic active sites, offering a promising strategy for efficient bio‐oil upgrading via selective HDO pathways.",

We have exemplified this approach with the catalytic propane combustion, CO oxidation, HCl oxidation, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the latter reaction representing the bottleneck in water electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources. For the incorporation of hydrogen into mixed oxides (hydrogen promotion), a specific design strategy is proposed: the mixed oxide (solid solution) consists of one metal oxide that is capable of activating H2 dissociation and a second component that stabilizes the mixed oxide against chemical reduction upon exposure to H2 at temperatures of 150–250 °C. To date this concept has been successfully demonstrated for solid solutions with rutile structure (RuxTi1‐xO2 and IrxTi1‐xO2). Hydrogen promotion of mixed oxides is expected to be useful in hydrogenation catalysis as well. Other mixed oxide systems in which hydrogen promotion is observed remain to be discovered. Hydrogenation of catalysts is so simple that it should be included in routine screening protocols of oxidation catalysts.",

Its activity can be controlled by ligands offering access to pharmacological Nurr1 modulation. However, the binding epitope(s) and molecular activation mechanisms of synthetic Nurr1 activators remained elusive but are essential to advance Nurr1 ligands towards new medicines. Here we characterized Nurr1 dimer dissociation and coregulator release as molecular contributions to Nurr1 activation by vidofludimus and locate its binding in an allosteric surface pocket lined by helices 1, 5, 7, and 8 by mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation. Structure-guided ligand design using these insights resulted in an optimized Nurr1 agonist with substantially enhanced potency and binding affinity. Our results provide a structural and molecular basis for Nurr1 activation by a synthetic agonist which was lacking for rational ligand design.",

We reveal that continuous-wave laser irradiation yields single crystals of the metastable polymorph, whereas continued irradiation with high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser pulses induces poly-crystallization of the stable form. Crucially, by strategically alternating between these two laser modalities during crystal growth, we can open up new crystallization pathways, including the single crystal growth of the stable phase.

We report that α-iminol rearrangements could be strategically redirected by the interception of Petasis reactions, in the context of being avoided by strong electron-withdrawing groups on the migrative aryl units. 1,4-Aryl migration prevails over 1,2-aryl migration via forming a boron-ate complex. By leveraging this reactivity, we developed a regiospecific synthesis of unsymmetrically 2,3-diaryl substituted indoles from three readily available feedstocks: an amine, an arylglyoxal, and a boronic acid. While traditional Petasis reactions with similar three-component inputs are typically applied to build C(sp3)-C(sp2) and C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds, the present transformation offers a special opportunity for constructing a C(sp2)-C(sp2) linkage. Highly substituted indole motifs with structural diversity in the C2 position are easily accessed by this three-component reaction. A mechanism containing a copper-cobalt collaborative promotion process was suggested.",

Despite its significance, the mechanisms influencing ICD in molecular complexes remain unclear. Here, we investigate and unambiguously prove the ICD process in thiophene dimer, an aromatic ring with a third-row atom. Using multi-particle momentum coincidence spectroscopy, accompanied by high-level electronic structure calculations, we elucidate that the ICD process is initiated from the sulfur-containing inner-valence orbitals which are energetically below the Auger threshold. This leads to an enhancement in the emission of low-energy ICD electrons compared to other aromatic ring dimers. By utilizing this ‘ICD-only decay’ contribution we quantify ICD probabilities above the Auger threshold. This study reveals the pivotal role of sulfur in shaping the ICD electron spectrum, which can be implied to control the low-energy electron emission in biological systems.",

This approach combines experimental hypotheses with mathematical and physical models, enabling a concise description of complex system dynamics and the extraction of kinetic parameters like kinetic pathways, time constants, and species amplitudes. However, building the final kinetic model requires several intermediate steps, including testing various assumptions and models across multiple experiments. In complex cases, some intermediate states may be unknown and are often simplified. This approach requires expertise in modeling and data comprehension, as poor decisions at any stage during data analysis can lead to an incorrect kinetic model, resulting in inaccurate results. Here, we introduce DLRN, a new deep learning-based framework, designed to rapidly provide a kinetic reaction network, time constants, and amplitude for the system, with comparable performance and, in part, even better than a classical fitting analysis. We demonstrate DLRN’s utility in analyzing multiple timescales datasets with complex kinetics, different 2D systems such as time-resolved spectra and agarose gel electrophoresis data, experimental datasets as nitrogen vacancy and strand displacement circuit (using photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques), even in scenarios where the initial state is a hidden, non-emitting dark state.",

Herein, we engineered an OER electrode from abundant stainless steel (SS) via facile approaches, and the obtained electrode consists of a Ni-rich oxide surface layer with a Fe-rich metal substrate. An outstanding activity was observed with an overpotential of 316 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, an electrode self-replenishing concept is proposed in which a Ni-rich catalyst layer can be regenerated from a metallic substrate due to the difference in diffusion and dissolution rates of metal oxides/hydroxides, and this regeneration is validated by various characterizations. A recorded degradation rate of 0.012 was observed at 1000 mA cm−2 for 1000 h. The facile engineering of OER electrodes from SS combined with the self-replenishing catalyst can potentially address the cost, activity, and long-term stability barriers.",

Furthermore, we evaluated the lipid species by comparing the SC-MSI results with those of supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

Although OAD has been used for untargeted lipidomics, its availability has been limited to the positive ion mode, requiring the independent use of a collision-induced dissociation (CID) method. In this study, we demonstrated the OAD MS/MS technique in the negative-ion mode for profiling phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, and sulfatides, where the fragmentation mechanism remained consistent with that in the positive ion mode. Furthermore, we proposed optimal conditions for the simultaneous acquisition of CID- and OAD-specific fragment ions, termed OAciD, where oxygen atoms and hydroxy radicals facilitate C=C position-specific fragmentation, while residual water vapor induces cleavage of low-energy covalent bonds as observed in CID. Finally, theoretical fragment ions were implemented in MS-DIAL 5 to accelerate C=C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics. The OAciD methodology was used to illuminate brain region-specific marmoset lipidomes with C=C positional information, including the estimation of C=C positional isomer ratios. We also characterized the profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids, finding that lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids were enriched in the cerebellum, whereas those containing omega-6 fatty acids were more abundant in the hippocampus and frontal lobe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Nitrogen-oxygen-sulfur (NOS) linkages act as allosteric redox switches, modulating enzymatic activity in response to redox fluctuations. While NOS linkages in proteins were once assumed to occur only between lysine and cysteine, our investigation shows that these bonds extend beyond the well–studied lysine-NOS-cysteine examples. By systematically analyzing over 86,000 high–resolution X-ray protein structures, we uncovered 69 additional NOS bonds, including arginine-NOS-cysteine and glycine-NOS-cysteine. Our pipeline integrates machine learning, quantum–mechanical calculations, and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data to systematically detect these subtle covalent interactions and identify key predictive descriptors for their formation. The discovery of these previously unrecognized linkages broadens the scope of protein chemistry and may enable targeted modulation in drug design and protein engineering. Although our study focuses on NOS linkages, the flexibility of this methodology allows for the investigation of a wide range of chemical bonds and covalent modifications, including structurally resolvable posttranslational modifications (PTMs). By revisiting and re-examining well-established protein models, this work underscores how systematic data-driven approaches can uncover hidden aspects of protein chemistry and inspire deeper insights into protein function and stability.",

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL), generated from tryptic digestion of 42 human recombinant proteins, in enhancing the detection and quantification of lower-abundance cancer-associated proteins. Additionally, we generated a combined sample-specific biological-rPSL by integrating the rPSL with a spectral library derived from pooled biological samples. We compared the performance of these libraries for DIA data extraction with standard methods, including sample-specific biological spectral library and library-free DIA methods. Our specific focus was on quantifying cancer-associated proteins, including key enzymes involved in kynurenine pathway, across patient-derived tissues and cell lines. Both rPSL and biological-rPSL-DIA approaches provided significantly improved coverage of lower-abundance proteins, enhancing sensitivity and more consistent protein quantification across matched tumour and adjacent noncancerous tissues from breast and colorectal cancer patients and in cancer cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that rPSL and biological-rPSL coupled with DIA-MS workflows, can address the limitations of both biological library-based and library-free DIA methods, offering a robust approach for quantifying low-abundance cancer-associated proteins in complex biological samples.",

This paper describes experimental data and a prediction model for challenging CCS prediction tasks including longer peptides that tend to have higher charge states. The proposed model is based on a pretrained deep protein language model. While the conventional prediction model requires training from scratch, the proposed model enables training with less amount of time owing to the use of the pretrained model as a feature extractor. Results of experiments with the novel experimental data show that the proposed model succeeds in drastically reducing the training time while maintaining the same or even better prediction performance compared with the conventional method. Our approach presents the possibility of prediction on the basis of \"greener\" manner training of various peptide properties in proteomic liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry experiments.",

By cultivating the producer strain, Actinokineospora auranticolor DSM 44650, an antibiotic complex-named kineomicins (Kmc)-was identified and characterized by microbiological assays, LC-MS, and MS/MS analyses. A comprehensive model for Kmc biosynthesis was then proposed by a thorough investigation of kineomicin BGC (knm). The structure of the main complex congener (KmcB), resolved by NMR spectroscopy, proved to be unique. Finally, the remarkably high antibiotic production rate, up to >1 g L-1 Kmc in benchtop bioreactor, indicated A. auranticolor as a natural GPA overproducer, holding promise as a potential host for heterologous expression of GPA BGCs.",

As the level of molecular crowding varies spatio-temporally in cells, it would be beneficial to predict the behaviour of DNA and RNA structures depending on the local cellular environments. This has applications in human mitochondria, which possess an especially crowded condition. In this study, the predictability of guanine-quadruplex (G4) DNA formation in the environment specific to human mitochondria was investigated. In accordance with the stability of duplexes predicted by our nearest-neighbour parameters, the G-rich duplex stability was found to effectively decrease and G4 formation was induced in mitochondrion-like conditions compared to the nucleus-like conditions. Using a peptide-based mitochondrial targeting system, a G4 reporter assay performed in mitochondria indicated that G4 formation were more favoured in mitochondria more than in the nucleus. These findings provide insights useful for the prediction of the behaviour of nucleic acids in mitochondria.",

A mononuclear complex, [Nd(L)(NO3)3] (1Nd), where L is a macrocyclic ligand, was synthesized and used as a precursor to develop two novel species: a dinuclear, [(Nd(L)(NO3))2(µ-BDC)](NO3)2·H2O (2Nd), linked by 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC), and a hexameric, [(Nd(L))(µ-BTC)(H2O)]6·35H2O (6Nd), linked with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC). Thermometric properties were studied in the physiological temperature range (292-332 K), utilizing 804 nm laser excitation (first biological window) and monitoring emissions in the second biological window (908, 1065, and 1340 nm) associated with the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, 4I11/2, 4I13/2 transitions, respectively. Among the complexes, the hexamer 6Nd exhibited exceptional performance, with Sr of 2.4%K-1 at 293 K, when luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) of two Stark components of the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 emission was used, positioning it as a high-performance NdIII-based thermometer. All complexes displayed anti-thermal quenching behavior, surpassing the current molecular-based thermometers in the near-infrared region. Theoretical calculations using complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF) and Boltzmann population models between Kramers doublets of the 4F3/2 level were performed to rationalize the anti-thermal behavior.",

While bismuth forms a rich variety of Zintl phases with the heavier alkaline-earth metals, there are significantly fewer magnesium compounds. Here we show that high-temperature high-pressure synthesis opens a convenient route for the preparation of Mg5Bi3Hx already at moderate conditions. The compound (space group Pnma, a = 11.5399(3) Å, b = 8.9503(2) Å and c = 7.8770(2) Å) adopts a Ca5Sb3F crystal structure. The minute amounts of hydrogen could only be detected by thermal decomposition of the compound in combination with mass spectroscopy of the gas phase. Direct space analysis of the chemical bonding allowed for allocating the hydrogen position at a partially occupied interstitial site and reveals strongly polar Mg-Bi and Mg-H bonds in accordance with the Zintl concept. Calculated band structures exhibit substantial electronic reorganization upon hydrogen insertion. The combination of advanced analytical tools in concert with modern quantum chemical techniques provides an efficient approach to allocate trace amounts of interstitial atoms stabilizing intermetallic phases.",

In AD mouse models, microglial expression of apoE3 reduces amyloid plaque burden through enhanced phagocytosis, whereas apoE4 is associated with impaired Aβ clearance. However, the isoform-specific interactions of apoE with Aβ aggregates and the molecular mechanisms by which these isoforms influence Aβ aggregation and clearance remain poorly understood, which is critical for developing potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we employed TIRFM, superresolution microscopy, and single-molecule photobleaching techniques to investigate the isoform-specific effects of apoE on the rate constants of Aβ42 aggregation at the single-fibril level, as well as to quantify the binding affinity and specificity of apoE isoforms to individual Aβ fibril ends. Our results show that apoE4 is ca. 4-5 times less effective than apoE3 and apoE2 in inhibiting fibril elongation, while secondary nucleation is largely unaffected by any of the isoforms. Furthermore, apoE3 exhibits stronger and more specific binding to fibril ends compared to apoE4. These findings suggest that apoE4's reduced affinity for growing fibril ends may impair microglial clearance and increase amyloid deposition through a higher elongation rate in the brain of ApoE-ε4 carriers.",

    "abstract": "Non-specific disruption of cellular membranes induced by amyloidogenic aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides remains a viable cytotoxicity mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Obtaining structural information about the intermediate states of Aβ-membrane systems and their molecular interactions is challenging due to their heterogeneity and low abundance. Here, we systematically study the molecular interactions of membrane-associated Aβ1-42 peptides using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, focusing on the primary nucleation phase of the fibrillation process. Compared to the less pathogenic Aβ1-40 peptide, Aβ1-42 forms smaller oligomers prior to fibrillation, as evidenced by a higher overall population of lipid-proximity peptides. Aβ1-42 also exhibits more pronounced residue-specific contacts with phospholipid headgroups compared to Aβ1-40, with multiple lipid-proximity segments throughout the entire primary sequence. The segments involved in initial inter-strand assembly overlap with those located near the lipid headgroups in Aβ1-42, whereas these two segments are distinct in Aβ1-40. ssNMR spectroscopy with sensitivity enhanced by Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) confirmed local secondary structural convergence during the nucleation process of Aβ1-42 and the presence of long-range tertiary contacts at early stages of nucleation. Overall, our results provide a molecular-level understanding of the Aβ1-42 nucleation process in a membrane-like environment and its membrane-disrupting intermediates. The comparison between Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 explains its higher cytotoxicity from the perspective of membrane disruption.",

The two polymorphs show distinct photochemical properties; Form I undergoes partial cis-trans isomerization, and Form II sustains a [2 + 2] photodimerization. The polymorphic forms also exhibit different photomechanical behaviors. While Form I shows differing photomechanical responses upon UV irradiation based on crystal morphology, Form II undergoes a solid-to-liquid transition upon photo-irradiation.",

Behavioral effects of anxiety chemosignals on recipients are established but it is unknown whether odor sensitivity can be modulated by such stimuli. We tested recipients’ sensitivity to phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) and n-butanol after exposure to anxiety chemosignals, neutral chemosignals and blank condition. As fourth condition, a horror movie was shown, to compare the effects of visual stimuli and chemosignals on odor sensitivity. Odor sensitivity for PEA was significantly increased by anxiety chemosignals compared to blank condition. No change in odor sensitivity was evident for n-butanol. We also investigated the composition of the applied chemosensory stimuli using untargeted one-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and -olfactometry (GC-O). Considering GC-MS data, several compounds were found with significantly higher normalized peak areas in anxiety sweat samples compared to the neutral samples. GC-O analysis indicated that the carboxylic acids dodecanoic acid and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid were potential main contributors to the odor of anxiety sweat samples, whereby tetradecanoic acid and patchouli alcohol were those of the odor of neutral sweat samples. This study provides evidence that anxiety chemosignals can improve odor sensitivity and constitutes a further step toward elucidating the composition of sweat samples used in chemical communication research.",

However, achieving stable cycling performance, particularly at high mass-loadings and elevated temperatures, remains a challenge. The stable cycling of high mass-loading sodium-ion battery cells is here made possible by addition of prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone (PES) to a non-flammable and fluorine-free electrolyte solution of sodium bis(oxalato)borate (NaBOB) salt in triethyl phosphate (TEP). This study investigates the thermal stability and electrochemical performance of such electrolyte at 40 °C and 55 °C, contrasting their performance with base NaBOB in TEP with and without ethylene sulfate (DTD) additive and with a reference carbonate electrolyte of NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate:diethylene carbonate (EC:DEC). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy was used to reveal degradation products formed in the electrolyte following a 4-weeks storage at 55 °C. Results from galvanostatic cycling at 55 °C demonstrated comparable performance of NaBOB–TEP + PES electrolyte and the reference carbonate electrolyte. The internal cell resistance was initially lower when cells were cycled at 55 °C than at 40 °C for all studied electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "TDP-43, a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein consisting of 414 residues, forms self-association in the nucleus for physiological gene regulation, while aggregation into amyloid (consisting of aberrant β-sheets) in the cytoplasm causes neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Post-translational phosphorylation of TDP-43 alters the self-association properties, which affects both the physiological function in the nucleus and the amyloidogenic potential in the cytoplasm, thereby impacting upon disease progression. However, insight into the role of per-residue phosphorylation in the self-association remains limited due to the difficulty in obtaining site-specifically phosphorylated TDP-43. Here, we demonstrate semi-synthesis of full-length TDP-43 that is uniformly phosphorylated at the 48th serine residue (designated as TDP1-414[pS48]). The synthetic scheme consisting of native chemical ligation followed by His-tag affinity chromatography efficiently gave TDP1-414(pS48) with a high purity. Interestingly, unlike non-phosphorylated TDP-43, the phosphorylated TDP-43 was found to have weak self-association property and to form aggregates that were not typical amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, chemical synthesis and three-dimensional structure analysis of the N-terminal domain (NTD, corresponding to TDP1-80) suggested that the phosphate ion at Ser48 weakens the inter-NTD interaction by inducing electrostatic repulsion. It significantly advances understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved in the post-translational modifications of TDP-43 associated with the neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Long-lived triplet exciton harvesting materials are of immense interest for applications in bioimaging, optoelectronics, anticounterfeiting, and sensing. However, achieving persistent room-temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) in metal-free systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present purely organic axially chiral aminoboranes (R/S-(BN)₂) with enhanced pRTP properties and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). By introducing axial chirality, the dual-core (R/S-(BN)₂) system achieves steric-hindrance-caused rigidity, which restricts molecular motions, leading to superior phosphorescence properties. Notably, R-(BN)₂ demonstrates a phosphorescence quantum yield (ΦP) of 9.2% (S-(BN)₂ : ΦP = 8.7%) and an extended lifetime of 0.9 sec at room temperature, significantly outperforming its mono-core counterpart (BN)₁ (ΦP = 3.0% and τP = 0.6 s). Theoretical analysis corroborates the observed improvements, revealing the synergistic role of borylation and axial chirality in stabilizing triplet states. Furthermore, the axially chiral aminoboranes exhibited CPL in dichloromethane solutions with a dissymmetry factor of ~10-3. These findings highlight the potential of axially chiral frameworks in designing efficient metal-free pRTP materials, as demonstrated in the security writing application, further paving the way for their use in bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting technologies, and next-generation organic electronics.",

Useful chromophores for photothermal therapy (PTT), such as nanoconfined oligomers and polymers, should not only display an excellent light-to-heat efficiency, but in addition must display biocompatibility and good water-solubility. We in this study have designed water-dispersible, nanocaged polypyrroles (PPy), embedded into single-chain nanoparticles (SCNP, sized 6.8 – 8.9 nm) displaying thermoresponsivity, so reaching largely increased PTT-effects. Such encaged PPy-SCNPs allow an efficient photothermal heat conversion reaching temperatures up to 85°C. In a parallelized 96-well-plate-design the PPy-SCNPs can effect an almost complete death of illuminated (cancer) cells at already low concentrations (0.001 mg/mL) with low radiant fluxes. The thermoresponsivity of the SCNPs, surrounding the PPy-chains, then responds to the photothermal heat, so creating a unique self-amplifying effect for photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging.",

    "abstract": "Solid electrolytes (SEs) typically consist of a static framework of anions (FA) and a sublattice of mobile cations (M), with non-covalent dispersion interactions (Edisp) playing a key role in structural stability. However, the impact of these interactions on M-ion migration-whether they assist or hinder it-remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the diffusion barriers of M-ions in SE frameworks, focusing on the M2B12H12 family (M = Li, Na, K), and clarify the role of non-covalent interactions. Our computational analyses reveal that moving from Li to Na to K analogues in M2B12H12 results in significant changes in many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions. The MBD interactions act as springs embedded within the M2B12H12 framework, regulating the effective coordination number (ECN) of M-ions and shaping the potential energy landscape for their migration. A linear correlation is observed between ECN and Edisp, consistent across different alkali ions. This correlation reveals a unified mechanism in which dispersion interactions regulate M-ion migration barrier and identifies a critical bottleneck for beyond-Li diffusion in M2B12H12 SEs. Intriguingly, MBD interactions further influence the prefactor in the diffusivity equation, driving anomalous diffusion behavior in SEs.",

Among the resistance mechanisms, that mediated by metallo-β-lactamases is of particular concern as these bacterial enzymes dismantle most β-lactam antibiotics, which are our widest applied and cheapest to produce antibiotic agents. So far, no clinically applicable metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors are available. Aiming to adapt to structural variations, we introduce the inhibitor concept: dynamically chiral phosphonic acids. We demonstrate that they are straightforward to synthesize, penetrate bacterial membranes, inhibit the metallo-β-lactamase enzymes NDM-1, VIM-2 and GIM-1, and are non-toxic to human cells. Mimicking the transition state of β-lactam hydrolysis, they target the Zn ions of the metallo-β-lactamase active site. As a unique feature, both of their stereoisomers bind metallo-β-lactamases, which provides them unparalleled adaptability to the structural diversity of these enzymes, and may allow them to hamper bacteria’s ability for resistance development.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control molecular adsorption and transformation on surfaces is key to advancing nanoscale fabrication, catalysis, and quantum materials engineering. Transition-metal metallocenes, such as nickelocene (NiCp2), offer intriguing opportunities due to their well-defined electronic and magnetic properties, making them ideal candidates for studying surface interactions at the atomic level. We investigate the adsorption and transformation of NiCp2, a nickel atom coordinated by two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings, on a Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At low temperatures, NiCp2 preferentially adsorbs at herringbone elbows and step edges, forming ordered assemblies. Upon heating, NiCp2 molecules dissociate into NiCp complexes and Cp radicals. The NiCp fragments self-assemble into one-dimensional chains, which further arrange into triangular structures due to the underlying Au(111) substrate, while Cp radicals exhibit low diffusion barriers on the surface. The dissociated NiCp fragments are non-magnetic, contrasting with the magnetic properties of intact NiCp2 molecules. The formation of one type of dimer of the NiCp fragment is rendered possible by the stabilization granted by gold atoms. This study highlights the controlled formation and assembly of surface-confined nanostructures via temperature-driven molecular dissociation.",

    "abstract": "Ionizable lipids are essential components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for efficient mRNA delivery. However, designing them for high protein expression, endosomal escape, and organ targeting is challenging due to complex structure-activity relationships. Here, we present a high-throughput platform for screening ionizable lipids using a two-step, scalable, one-pot reaction. This enabled the synthesis and vivo screening of 91 new lipids, followed by a structure-activity study, leading to the development of CP-LC-0729, which significantly surpasses the MC3 benchmark in protein expression with preliminary studies showing no in vivo toxicity. Additionally, a one-step strategy helped to yield a permanently cationic lipid which was tested in a fifth-lipid formulation, showing a highly selective lung delivery with a 32-fold increase in protein expression in vivo, outperforming current endogenous targeting strategies. All these findings underscore the potential of lipid CP-LC-0729 and our lipid platform in advancing the efficiency and specificity of mRNA delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Self-healing is a fundamental ability inherent in humans, plants, and other living organisms. To date, a variety of materials with self-healing properties have been developed. However, these materials usually require external inputs such as electric potentials or healing agents to initiate or promote self-healing reactions. Herein, we present a novel self-healing mechanism that operates without any external input, utilizing the dynamic equilibrium between the solid-state and dissolved materials. We employed organic–inorganic perovskites to validate our strategy. Single-particle spectroscopy and imaging demonstrated the spontaneous self-healing of perovskites after photodamage under dynamic equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, we found that perovskites can generate hydrogen in both healed and damaged states. Remarkably, the perovskites exhibited hydrogen generation over four cycles of photodamage and self-healing. The proposed concept and experimental results provide valuable insights for the development of energy conversion and storage systems with improved long-term durability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The field of epitranscriptomics is undergoing a technology-driven revolution. During past decades, RNA modifications like N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine (ψ), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) became acknowledged for playing critical roles in cellular processes. Direct RNA sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) enabled the detection of modifications in native RNA, by detecting noncanonical RNA nucleosides properties in raw data. Consequently, the field’s cutting edge has a heavy component in computer science, opening new avenues of cooperation across the community, as exchanging data is as impactful as exchanging samples. Therefore, we seize the occasion to bring scientists together within the RNA Modification and Processing (RMaP) challenge to advance solutions for RNA modification detection and discuss ideas, problems and approaches. We show several computational methods to detect the most researched mRNA modifications (m6A, ψ, and m5C). Results demonstrate that a low prediction error and a high prediction accuracy can be achieved on these modifications across different approaches and algorithms. The RMaP challenge marks a substantial step towards improving algorithms’ comparability, reliability, and consistency in RNA modification prediction. It points out the deficits in this young field that need to be addressed in further challenges.",

Here, we introduce ChemLM, a transformer language model for this task. ChemLM leverages self-supervised domain adaptation on chemical molecules to enhance its predictive performance. Within the framework of ChemLM, chemical compounds are conceptualized as sentences composed of distinct chemical ‘words’, which are employed for training a specialized chemical language model. On the standard benchmark datasets, ChemLM either matched or surpassed the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of ChemLM in identifying highly potent pathoblockers targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), a pathogen that has shown an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains and has been identified as a critical priority for the development of new medications. ChemLM demonstrated substantially higher accuracy in identifying highly potent pathoblockers against PA when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. An intrinsic evaluation demonstrated the consistency of the chemical language model’s representation concerning chemical properties. The results from benchmarking, experimental data and intrinsic analysis of the ChemLM space confirm the wide applicability of ChemLM for enhancing molecular property prediction within the chemical domain.",

They are formed via the anion-exchange reaction between lanthanide(III) bromide and metal(II) acetate salts and driven by a mismatch in hard-soft acid-base character. The crystal structure of EuHg revealed a heteropolymeric 1-D structure, with cationic acetate-bridged and anionic bromide-bridged chains forming parallel arrays; IR, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopic data of LnPb strongly suggested similarity with the LnHg compounds. The analogous reaction with EuCl3·6H2O and Hg(OAc)2 forms an isostructural material, but substituting Pb(OAc)2 generates [Eu(OAc)2(OH2)3]Cl and PbCl2 instead of a mixed-metal product comparable to LnPb. An N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate [Eu(OAc)2(DMF)3](PbBr3)] (EuPb·DMF) was structurally characterized, showing the same heteropolymeric motif as EuHg and resembling an organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskite due the anionic chain of face-sharing bromoplumbate(II) octahedra. Photoluminescence properties of the compounds, including lifetime measurements and Tb(III)→Eu(III) energy transfer parameters for the LnM 50:50 Eu/Tb solid-solutions are described.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) reflective pigments are considered as energy-efficient cooling materials to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect and reduce energy consumption. In this study, a novel blue pigment based on Mg1-xCoxTiO3 with high NIR reflectance was synthesized by spray pyrolysis, and its crystallographic and optical properties were investigated by varying the Co content and the calcination temperature. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and TEM analyses revealed that the prepared Mg1-xCoxTiO3 pigments possessed an impurity-free ilmenite crystal structure and a dense spherical shape with a uniform distribution of Co. The intense blue color is due to the 4T1g (F) → 4T1g (P) transition of Co2+ in the octahedral ligand field. The optimal Co content and calcination temperature for obtaining the highest NIR reflectance with excellent blue characteristics were determined to be 20% (x = 0.2) and 800 °C, respectively. As a result, the Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 blue pigment (L* = 59.8, a* = -1.23, b* = -36.8) shows a high NIR solar reflectance of 78.9%, which is 34% higher than that of CoAl2O4. The color difference (ΔE*) values before and after immersed in acid/alkaline solution are less than 1.0, indicating that Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 exhibits excellent chemical stability. The temperature rise test under NIR irradiation demonstrated that the synthesized Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 blue pigment exhibited improved heat shielding performance compared to that of CoAl2O4. Therefore, Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 could be used as a promising cool blue pigment for sustainable solutions to alleviate heat accumulation due to sunlight.",

A variety of B(3,4,5,6)-tetra-arylated o-carboranes were synthesized in good-to-excellent yields. Moreover, the mono-, di-, and triarylated intermediate products were isolated, and the exact structures were determined by NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and X-ray analysis, which provide a rationale that the order of introduction of aryl groups into o-carborane is B(4) > B(5) > B(3)/B(6). This protocol represents a powerful synthetic method for constructing polyfunctionalization of o-carborane derivatives under very mild and simple reaction conditions, which offers a valuable reference for the design and synthesis of molecular propellers based on carboranes.",

In this work, we successfully synthesized a series of color-tunable Pr3+ single-doped Ca2InTaO6 (CITO:Pr3+) persistent luminescence (PersL) materials by using a high-temperature solid-state method. The crystal structure of the obtained CITO:Pr3+ phosphor was characterized by X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. Concentration-, excitation wavelength-, and temperature-dependent optical properties were systematically studied, and the results revealed that these materials display versatile luminescence behaviors and possess excellent optical temperature sensing characteristics and remarkable anticounterfeiting capabilities. Furthermore, by incorporating defect energy levels through nonequivalent substitution of Pr3+ for Ca2+, the materials also exhibit red PersL emission. This multimodal luminescence capability underpins their potential for dynamic multiple anticounterfeiting applications. Additionally, the differential thermal quenching rates between the 3P0 → 3H4 and 1D2 → 3H4 transitions of Pr3+ were leveraged for optical temperature sensing. The CITO:0.015Pr3+ phosphor, when excited at 318 nm, achieved maximum absolute sensitivity (Sa) and relative sensitivity (Sr) values of 20.42% K-1 at 393 K and 2.37% K-1 at 345 K, respectively. These results highlight the promising potential of CITO:Pr3+ materials for both multimodal dynamic anticounterfeiting and precise optical temperature measurement.",

Rh(PAlP) exhibits high reactivity in difficult σ-bond activations and flexible dependence of reaction mechanism on substrate and solvent.

The reduction of Np(V) to Np(IV) represents a pivotal step toward efficient Np recovery. However, this process is profoundly influenced by the intricate redox chemistry of Np itself and the diverse concomitant fission products in spent nuclear fuel, with the underlying mechanistic details remaining inadequately elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that molybdenum (Mo) and iron (Fe) dramatically accelerated the reduction rate of Np(V) by approximately 2 × 104-fold. Additionally, by integrating analytical techniques including absorption spectroscopy, stopped-flow spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and solvent extraction, we deciphered the electron transfer interactions between Mo and Fe, as well as their synergistic catalytic mechanism in driving the Np(V)-Np(IV) conversion. This study not only advances the fundamental understanding of Np redox chemistry in complex nuclear waste matrices but also offers technical support for optimizing nuclear waste treatment protocols.",

UV-vis spectra in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed absorption maxima at 370 and 391 nm, attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions, as confirmed by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. Electrochemical studies revealed two one-electron reduction events: -0.12 and -0.77 V for Re(CO)3Cl(phendione) and -0.30 and -0.79 V for Re(CO)3Cl(AQphen) (vs Ag/AgCl). In the presence of CO2, the second reduction shifted positively by 0.20 and 0.14 V, indicating adduct formation. Association constants (log K) were 5.4 and 3.9 for phendione and AQphen derivatives, respectively. DFT calculations supported formation of [quinone-CO2]2- adducts, with bond lengths of 1.447 and 1.406 Å. Under blue LED light (410 nm) and CO2, photochemical experiments showed spectral changes consistent with reduced quinone-CO2 species.

    "abstract": "The emergence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, clearly linked to the in vivo dissociation of Gd(III)-based MRI contrast agents (CA), has promoted intensive research to identify safe CA candidates. Towards this goal, we have designed the novel ligand H4OPDMA, which combines a rigidified macrocycle, low total ligand basicity, and malonate pendant arms to increase the number of donor atoms. Thanks to these design elements, H4OPDMA is capable of forming a Gd(III) chelate with high thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Indeed, the conditional stability of [Gd(OPDMA)]- (pGd = 14.8; pH 7.4, cGdL = 10-5 M) calculated for physiological conditions is comparable to that of [Gd(DTPA)]2- (pGd = 15.6), and its dissociation half-life is estimated to be 3.2 years at 37 °C and pH 7.4, making it an exceptionally inert chelate. Moreover, the water proton relaxation enhancement efficacy of [Gd(OPDMA)]- (r1 = 4.5 mM-1 s-1, 25°C, 20 MHz) is similar to that of clinical MRI contrast agents. Luminescence lifetime measurements and 17O NMR data confirmed the presence of one water molecule in the inner sphere of the metal ion (q = 1), which undergoes relatively fast exchange (kex298 = (73 ± 12) × 106 s-1). The fast water exchange can likely be related to an associatively activated mechanism, as suggested by the negative activation entropy, ΔS⧧ = -(7 ± 1) J mol-1 K-1. In accordance with this, DFT calculations indicate an eight-coordinated structure for the Gd(III) ion, involving one water molecule and seven donor atoms of the OPDMA4-, while one carboxylate group remains uncoordinated.",

    "abstract": "Coordination-driven self-assembly is an efficient strategy for designing polynuclear structures with preorganized catalytic sites. Here, we explore the electrocatalytic behavior of a self-assembled copper porphyrin cube featuring iron nodes (Fe-Cu) using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as model transformations. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemical experiments, and XPS data revealed that Fe-Cu decompose to regenerate Cu-TAPP under catalytic conditions. The CO2RR versus HER activity of Fe-Cu was tested under heterogeneous conditions to preserve the preorganized cubic arrangement of porphyrins. Upon scission of the Fe-imine nodes, the catalytic activity of the constructed Fe-Cu differs from Cu-TAPP and physical mixtures of Fe(II) and Cu-TAPP. Like free Fe(II) salts, the Fe-Cu-based materials were more selective for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas Cu-TAPP generated a mixture of CO2RR products. Spectroscopic methods were used to establish that the Fe-Cu releases Cu-TAPP under reducing conditions, making the shift in selectivity particularly notable since the same active species is present in both systems. This study illustrates the use of self-assembly to preorganize catalytic sites and exploits the limited molecular movement under heterogeneous conditions to preserve a polynuclear microenvironment despite operating under conditions where the assembly does not remain intact.",

Subsequent density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to conduct a comparative analysis of their structural evolution, stability, electronic properties, vibrational spectra, and chemical bonding characteristics. Key findings reveal that both La2Mgn and Lu2Mgn clusters adopt cage-like architectures for medium sizes (n ≥ 10), with rare-earth atoms encapsulated within the magnesium framework. Stability analyses identified La2Mg10, La2Mg15, Lu2Mg10, and Lu2Mg15 as potential ″magic-number″ clusters exhibiting enhanced relative stability. Electronic structure investigations through natural population analysis (NPA) demonstrate consistent electron transfer from Mg to rare-earth atoms, with lutetium exhibiting greater electron affinity than lanthanum. Notably, valence orbital distributions reveal distinct hybridization patterns between 5d/6s (Lu) and 5d/6s/4f (La) atomic orbitals. Theoretical infrared and Raman spectra predictions provide characteristic vibrational fingerprints to guide future experimental identification. Bonding critical point (BCP) analysis via atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory further elucidates the nature of interatomic interactions in these heterometallic systems.",

    "abstract": "High-valent iron oxido species, central to many enzymatic and biomimetic catalyzed organic oxidative transformations, can be generated by direct electrochemical oxidation, circumventing high-energy O atom donor reagents. Electrochemical generation necessitates knowledge of the redox potentials involved, which is hindered by the lack of well-defined Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox waves in the voltammetry of many iron-based catalysts. Hence, other approaches including chemical oxidation and bulk spectro(electro)chemical methods need to be taken. In the case of the well-studied oxidation catalyst, [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+, where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine, estimates of the Fe(III/IV) redox potentials range from 0.4 to 1.3 V vs SCE. Here, we show that electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy reveals \"hidden\" redox waves, and hence redox potentials, when coupled with cyclic voltammetry. Rapid spectral acquisition (>2 Hz) of surface-enhanced Raman spectra at electrochemically roughened gold electrodes enables real-time spectral acquisition during cyclic voltammetry. We show that the Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox potential of [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+ is close to that determined earlier by chemical redox titrations (0.85 V vs SCE). Furthermore, comproportionation and adsorption processes are shown to impact the rates of electron transfer observed, which rationalizes the absence of a distinct Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox wave in its cyclic voltammetry.",

PSI was successfully encapsulated within ZIF-8 (PSI@ZIF-8) and immobilized on ZIF-8 surfaces (PSI/ZIF-8) using a one-pot synthesis and surface impregnation technique, respectively. Characterization techniques including powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation and first-of-its-kind nanoscale visualization of the PSI/ZIF-8 composites. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that while PSI encapsulation resulted in minor structural changes potentially from scaffolding-induced stress and MOF building blocks, the overall protein integrity was maintained. Our study demonstrates that, in contrast to surface interfacing, ZIF-8 encapsulation provides a protective environment for PSI, enhancing its stability and retaining its functional properties, thereby offering an auspicious approach for the development of biohybrid materials in semi-artificial photosynthesis and other biotechnological applications.",

Here, we present the synthesis of the unprecedented heteroleptic Tb(III) bis(amide) chloride complex, (NHAr*)2TbCl (1) (where Ar* = 2,6-(Ar')2C6H3, Ar' = 2,4,6-(iPr)3C6H2), which was chemically reduced using the strong reducing agent, KC8, to yield a new member of this small family of highly reactive TbII compounds, namely, the homoleptic terbium bis(amide) complex, (NHAr*)2Tb (2). Notably, the spectroscopic and magnetic characterization of 2 revealed that the compound contains a formally divalent terbium ion since the additional electron was exclusively found to reside in the primarily arene ligand-based π* orbitals, as corroborated by ab initio calculations. Furthermore, 2 exhibits slow magnetic relaxation between 1.8 and 16 K under a 1250 Oe applied dc field. Ab initio calculations uncovered that magnetic relaxation occurs through the first excited spin-orbit state. Study of 2 via SQUID magnetometry hints at considerably weaker 4f-5d magnetic coupling relative to other TbII complexes, rendering its electronic structure unique relative to that of other neutral organometallic TbII complexes.",

Notably, a μ-1,2 mode was discarded for the b-state due to a lack of exemplar molecular species and expectation that such a mode would have a higher energy infrared (IR) absorption than observed experimentally (viz. 1735-1860 cm-1).

Further enhancements through the integration of a diffusive layer resulted in a 270% increase in efficiency, reaching an EQE of 39.3% and current efficiency of 109.6 cd A-1. This efficient technology demonstrates significant potential and lays the groundwork for future high-performance light-emitting devices.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are mainly synthesized via recrystallization from solutions that contain molecular building blocks; however, this is not an infallible strategy. For example, the formation of hydrogen bonds between the building blocks and molecules of the crystallization solvent may prevent the construction of the frameworks. Herein, we propose a guest-exchange-based strategy for converting non-HOF crystals to HOFs. Specifically, non-HOF crystals of bis(benzimidazole)ZnCl2 complex 1 (bis(benzimidazole) = phenylbis(benzimidazol-2-yl)methane) obtained from its N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution (12·(DMF)5) were converted to HOF crystals via the exchange of DMF to acetone or tetrahydrofuran by exposing 12·(DMF)5 to the corresponding vapor. Interestingly, the complete guest exchange is not always required, which further emphasizes the convenience of the guest-exchange strategy in HOF synthesis. We also demonstrate that HOF crystals synthesized via guest exchange can serve as an adsorber for acetone and diethyl-ether vapors.",

The results revealed that ligand exchange reactions are instantaneous, giving rise to the standard Gaussian distribution indicative of a random exchange or substitution process. In sharp contrast, metal exchange reactions are slow (hours to days), resulting in fractal-like patterns. The intercluster Au-Ag exchange occurs in the innermost icosahedral core of the cluster. These reactions, when performed with a permeable membrane separating the two reactants, provided strong evidence that both exchanges require bimolecular collisions resembling conventional SN2-type reactions between two superatomic clusters. This notion was further corroborated by the unexpected observation of \"half\" Au and \"half\" Ag peaks in the mass spectra, which may be taken as circumstantial evidence for the formation of a transient dimer [(AuAg)44(SR)30]28- upon intercluster collisions in solution. Finally, the effects of experimental conditions, such as solvent and temperature, were also investigated.",

    "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show promise in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their intrinsic porosity and structural tunability, but their performance is often limited by poor reactant diffusion and slow charge transfer. In this paper, we obtained the UiO-68-NH2 (Zr-N) MOF with flake, octahedron, block, and flower morphologies in different sizes by adjusting the concentrations of acetic acid and water modulators. It is disclosed that the introduced acetic acid can compete with organic ligands for coordination with zirconium nodes, whereas water can affect the hydrolysis rate of zirconium precursors, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystal growth of the Zr-N crystals. Therefore, their synergistic effect led to the successful synthesis of Zr-N ions with different morphologies and sizes. Notably, the flower-like Zr-N with a size of about 100 nm and maximum specific surface area exposure of abundant active sites, which facilitates the diffusion of reactants as well as enhances the separation and transfer rate of photogenerated carriers, endowing it with excellent hydrogen evolution performance (989 μmol g-1 h-1) and being about 75 times higher than that of the bulk Zr-N counterpart (13 μmol g-1 h-1). This work validates the critical role of morphology engineering in advancing MOF-based photocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.",

    "abstract": "Developing catalysts with high efficiency and low cost for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is attractive but challenging. Herein, relying on the high catalytic activity of Ni, low overpotential of Co, and superior antipoisoning resistance of Mo, a NiMoO4-NiCo2O4 p-p heterojunction is constructed via a hydrothermal strategy followed by calcination. Interestingly, phase transformation of β-NiMoO4 to α-NiMoO4 occurs when a heterojunction is generated. The unique structure of NiMoO4-NiCo2O4 enables faster charge transfer capability, greater active site availability, lower impedance, and reduced activation energy. Thus, a much better catalytic performance for the UOR is triggered when employing NiMoO4-NiCo2O4 as a catalyst. A specific current density of 1306 mA cm-2 mg-1 (at 0.6 V vs Hg/HgO) is achieved for NiMoO4-NiCo2O4, which is much larger than that for NiMoO4 and NiCo2O4. Potential-dependent impedance analyses unveil that Ni3+ should be active sites and both indirect and direct urea oxidation paths should be accelerated on NiMoO4-NiCo2O4. Phase transformation of β-NiMoO4 to α-NiMoO4 is vital. Making the energy bands of NiCo2O4 and NiMoO4 match better, promoting Ni3+ formation, facilitating active sites exposure, and reducing alkalinity to enhance antipoisoning capacity all make sense. This work stresses the importance of crystal phases in developing heterojunctions with high catalytic performance.",

In this study, a LaCo0.67Cu0.33O3 (LCCO) composite perovskite electrocatalyst was synthesized using a sol-gel method followed by acid etching for defect engineering (LCCO-x, where x = 6, 12, 24, and 30, indicating the treatment time in hours). Particularly, LCCO-24 exhibited high activity and improved reaction kinetics for both the OER and HER under alkaline conditions. When employed for overall water splitting, it achieved a low full-cell voltage of 1.49 V at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2, comparable to leading noble metal catalysts. Analysis confirmed that the enhancement in bifunctional electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the increased presence of oxygen defects and the increase in surface area. This study demonstrates that defect engineering is an effective approach for investigating perovskite oxides in the context of electrochemical water splitting.",

Herein, we introduce S-doped VO2 (S-VO2) as a cathode material, leveraging sulfur incorporation to regulate the electronic structure, suppress vanadium dissolution, and improve electrochemical performance. The introduction of sulfur not only induces oxygen vacancies, which enhance electronic conductivity and facilitate rapid electron transfer, but also strengthens the V-O bond, effectively mitigating vanadium dissolution during cycling. As a result, the S-VO2 cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 386.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, retains 79.6% of its capacity over 1600 cycles at 2.0 A g-1, and exhibits outstanding long-term durability with 80.3% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at 10.0 A g-1. Ex situ XRD, in situ Raman, and XPS analyses confirm the highly reversible Zn2+ storage mechanism, while XANES and EXAFS studies reveal that S doping stabilizes the local coordination environment of vanadium, reducing structural distortions and enhancing cycling stability. This work highlights the synergistic role of sulfur doping and oxygen defects in optimizing cathode materials, providing valuable insights for the design of next-generation AZIBs with superior performance and long-term reliability.",

Ag-MOFs demonstrated significant visible light absorption and excellent chemical stability, with superoxide radicals identified as the primary reactive oxygen species. The photocatalytic performance is supported by band gap energy calculation and photophysical studies, including electrochemical impedance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The photocatalytic performance of an Ag-MOF was critically influenced by its architecture, including the presence of argentophilic interactions.

The study revealed that steric hindrance at the ligand's bridge carbon strongly influenced both oxidation behavior and coordination modes. Smaller substituents (e.g., H and Me) facilitated oxidation to form pyridyl-imine species under adventitious oxygen, whereas bulky substituents (e.g., i-Bu and mesityl) suppressed oxidation, yielding stable pyridyl-amine or 16-electron pyridyl-amido complexes. Moreover, iridium(III) complexes were more prone to oxidation than the corresponding ruthenium(II) complexes under similar conditions. The aqueous stability of the newly synthesized complexes was confirmed. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that most of the complexes exhibited notable anticancer potency against A549, HeLa and cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cancer cells. Mechanistic studies suggested a redox-driven pathway involving the catalytic oxidation of NADH to NAD+, the elevation of ROS levels and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Notably, pyridyl-amine complexes induced apoptosis, while 16-electron pyridyl-amido complexes did not, though both caused S phase cell cycle arrest. Additionally these complexes can inhibit A549 cell migration, suggesting their potential to reduce cancer metastasis.",

Cyanobacteria must tightly regulate metal homeostasis to prevent deficiency or toxicity, yet their metallophores remain overlooked. Here, we report lusichelins A-E (1-5), new metallophores isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lusitaniella coriacea LEGE 07167. Their structures and configurational assignments were determined by using NMR, mass spectrometry, TD-DFT calculations, and retrobiosynthetic insights. Lusichelins feature a unique structural arrangement with thiazoline/thiazole rings connected via a vinyl group, an aliphatic carbon chain, or directly enabling the potential for metal coordination. Genomic analysis identified a hybrid PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with the lusichelin structure, bearing traits characteristic of metallophore biosynthesis. Functionally, lusichelins act as metallophores capable of chelating both iron and copper. Lusichelin C (3) consistently bound iron under both metal-rich and metal-limited culture conditions, while copper complexation was only observed under elevated copper levels. At physiologically relevant pH values, no significant metal-binding preference was detected. Moreover, compound production was maximized under metal-rich conditions and in response to copper limitation. Lusichelin B (2) exhibited cytotoxicity against colon carcinoma cells while reversing multidrug resistance via ABCB1 efflux pump modulation. These findings expand our understanding of cyanobacterial metallophores in microbial metal homeostasis and highlight their biological potential.",

    "abstract": "Fusarihexins C-E, a group of cyclodepsipeptides that contain a characteristic 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (HICA) residue, were recently isolated from the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. The absolute stereochemistry of HICA was determined to be R in fusarihexin C using a modified Mosher's method. It was assumed that HICA in fusarihexins D and E would have the same configuration, as they are derived from the same biological source. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structures of fusarihexins D and E as well as three new analogues. The compounds were synthesized by employing solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and high dilution macrolactamization and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Comparing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of synthesized and natural compounds revealed that the HICA residue has the S-configuration in fusarihexin D. The antiplasmodium activity on Plasmodium falciparum and antitumor activity against MCF7 and A431 cells were also investigated. Encouragingly, fusarihexin D (with S-HICA) displayed potent antiplasmodium activity by interfering with the ring stage of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite life cycle (IC50 at 650 nM).",

The results highlight the advantages of (7S,7'S,8'S)-2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan, (-)-γ-diisoeugenol. A series of derivatives with effective absolute configurations were synthesized with high stereoselectivity via intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reactions, and biological assays were performed. The most effective compound identified in this research was the (4-OCH3, 5-OCH3, 3'-CF3, 4'-OH)-derivative (EC50 = 8.6 μM). The combination of a hydrophobic group at the 3'-position and a phenolic hydroxy group at the 4'-position was crucial for the high activity. The 8'-epimer of the effective (7S,7'S,8'S)-2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan compound was also prepared by stereoselective hydrogenation of the 7-8' internal alkene. Thus, a novel anti-phytopathogenic fungal 2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan-type indane was developed.",

Mass spectrometry-based molecular networking and other advanced computational data mining techniques were employed to explore the chemical space of natural AETX derivatives. We identified a total of 43 biosynthetic intermediates and derivatives of AETX, including several iodinated derivatives, a rare halogenation in specialized metabolites of freshwater organisms. Structural characterization of these metabolites showed that most of them are AETX derivatives with varying substitution patterns of the bromo or iodo substituents, but also, AETX biosynthetic intermediates and other biindole derivatives were detected. Cytotoxicity assays of two isolated derivatives and AETX showed that they differ markedly in their activity.",

Notably, a substantial increase in the plasma concentration of isocorynoxeine was observed in human microbiota-colonized rats following isorhynchophylline administration compared to those without colonization, suggesting that the dehydrogenation of isorhynchophylline by gut microbiota observed in the in vitro screening system also occurs in vivo. 16S rRNA gene sequencing further revealed an increased abundance of Klebsiella and Escherichia-Shigella following isorhynchophylline administration, suggesting that these genera may influence its microbial transformation or pharmacological activity.",

However, the stereochemical complexity of 2,5-DKPs presents challenges in chemical synthesis, particularly concerning indole derivatives such as indole diketopiperazines (IDKPs). Prenylation and oxidation further diversify these structures, enhancing their bioactivity and membrane affinity. Despite recent advances, the biosynthetic pathways of IDKPs, especially those involving dual prenylation, remain inadequately understood. In this study, the fellutanine biosynthetic gene cluster from Nannizzia fulva was cloned and heterologously expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. A partially oxidized intermediate in the fellutanine biosynthetic pathway was characterized. The dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS) enzyme FelB was shown to catalyze consecutive prenylations at two C-2 positions of cyclo(l-Trp-l-Trp) in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Additionally, comparative studies with the known DMATS enzyme OkaC revealed differences in the regioselectivity. Furthermore, the biprenylation mechanism of FelB and OkaC was elucidated through molecular docking and active site analysis.",

Recent efforts focus on sustainable raw materials to develop environmentally friendly processes and products that align with global sustainability goals. Among these, Chios mastic gum, derived from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia), is notable for its diverse food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics applications. One of its key components is cis-1,4-poly-β-myrcene, a natural polyterpene polymer, constituting 20-30% of the resin's composition. Despite its potential, the complex composition of Chios mastic gum poses challenges in extracting, isolating, and quantifying its polymeric content. NMR spectroscopy offers a nondestructive approach and may be instrumental in developing standardized methods for quantifying cis-1,4-poly-β-myrcene in Chios mastic gum. Such methods are vital for understanding the resin's composition and exploring potential applications, particularly in sustainable materials and biomedical fields. This study addresses these challenges by producing a cis-1,4-poly-β-myrcene sample as a standard in quantification procedures. Centrifugal partition chromatography, a support-free liquid-liquid chromatography technique, was employed to purify the polymeric fraction. The polymer was then characterized through size exclusion chromatography and NMR methods, including DOSY and quantitative HSQC experiments, to facilitate an accurate analysis and open the door to further applications of this natural polymer.",

Among them, the leaf extract of Syzygium simile demonstrated significant inhibitory activity of 40% at 25 μg/mL, emerging as the most promising species. Through bioassay-guided fractionation, 20 compounds were isolated from the n-hexane layer of the leaves, including nine new compounds [simisyzygins C-G (1-5, respectively) and simicadinenes A-D (6-9, respectively)] and 11 known compounds. These new compounds possess unique carbon skeletons characterized as flavonoid-sesquiterpenoid hybrids. Their structures were elucidated by the analysis of spectroscopic data. The structures of 1, 4, 5, and 11 were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Syzygioblane B (11) demonstrated the most potent inhibition of LD accumulation in Huh7 cells, achieving a 64.1% reduction at 40 μM with dose-dependency (5-40 μM) and no observable cytotoxicity.

    "abstract": "Pentavalent antimonials are the first-line treatment for localized cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, they have disadvantages such as their elevated toxicity, high costs, and parenteral application. Plant-derived compounds may be an alternative treatment against this disease. Previous in vitro studies have shown that (3S)-16,17-didehydrofalcarinol (1), a polyacetylene oxylipin isolated from Tridax procumbens, is active against Leishmania mexicana. We have analyzed the mechanism of action of compound 1, evaluating reactive oxygen species production, apoptosis of L. mexicana, cytotoxicity in murine macrophages, and its efficacy in controlling the disease progression and parasite load when applied topically in C57BL/6 mice infected with L. mexicana. Results show that parasites incubated with 1.6 μM compound 1 significantly increased reactive oxygen species production (p ≤ 0.05). The percentage of apoptosis also increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) and did not affect the viability of macrophages. The application of the topical formulations with 0.5% and 0.75% compound 1 for 7 weeks reduced disease progression and parasite load. We demonstrate that compound 1 generates the death of L. mexicana by apoptosis through reactive oxygen species production. We conclude that compound 1 can be used a possible alternative treatment for localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, enabling a less painful and more accessible therapy.",

Comparative analysis revealed identical relative configurations of compounds 1, 3, 4, and 5. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 3 were determined to have an identical absolute configuration, whereas the absolute configuration of compound 4 remained inconclusive due to a significant mismatch in its ECD spectral profile compared to compound 1.

Here, we report that the readily prepared compound 10, which embodies the 2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-3-one core of bohemamine D (1) and is the bis-O-methyl ether of the alkaloid discoipyrrole C, is converted into 1,3-oxazin-6-one 11 on heating at elevated temperatures in air. The mechanism of this conversion was studied using density functional theory and the biosynthetic implications of it are discussed. The photochemical reaction of compound 10 in the presence of oxygen is also detailed and, again, the possible biosynthetic implications of the resulting conversion are considered.",

The absolute configuration of these alkaloids, including cryptaustoline, has been a topic of debate due to conflicting studies. Having in our laboratory some authentic samples of dibenzopyrrocoline-type Cryptocarya alkaloids, we decided to reinvestigate their absolute configuration using modern spectroscopic techniques along with TDDFT calculations. The NMR reinvestigation of the authentic sample of cryptowolinol led us to revise its relative configuration using ML-J-DP4 and DP4+ analyses. Moreover, the absolute configuration of all dibenzopyrrocoline alkaloids reported to date benefitted from a complete re-evaluation based on a comparison with TDDFT-SR and TDDFT-ECD predictions leading to a unified absolute configuration. At last, this patrimonial reinvestigation unveiled a historical sample corresponding to a heretofore unpublished dibenzopyrrocoline alkaloid, which we named isocryptaustoline. The reisolation of this molecule from the total alkaloid extract of Cryptocarya oubatchensis makes it a genuine natural product.",

In this work, a two-step chemo-enzymatic flow method for the efficient esterification and amidation of phenolic acids was developed and successfully applied to the synthesis of riparin derivatives and HCAAs. The flow Fischer esterification was optimized using vanillic acid as a model starting material and SiliaBond Tosic Acid (SCX-3) as an immobilized acid catalyst, achieving a quantitative yield in a short residence time. The following amidation step, catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B, was optimized in toluene, leading to the desired amides. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their radical scavenging, antibacterial, and antileishmanial properties. Overall, this work disclosed a novel approach for the efficient synthesis of riparin derivatives and HCAAs with interesting biological properties.",

The structures of 1-7 were established by the analysis of NMR, high-resolution MS, and comparison of the experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Cinerol L (1) is particularly noteworthy, as it features a 5H-pyrrolo[1,2a]-benzimidazole moiety modified by an ethyl sulfonate, while cinerols N (3) and O (4) possess a unique acetyl-substituted hydroquinone moiety. Cinerols L-R (1-7) were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) with IC50 values of 5-20 μM in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Furthermore, the potent inhibitory activity on inflammatory cytokines of 4 prompted us to evaluate its effect on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, a critical pathway that contributes to the inflammatory responses. Cinerol O (4) was unveiled to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and the production of inflammatory cytokines via suppressing the expression of NF-κB and MAPKs in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages.",

Previous studies have reported evidence of the therapeutic potential of C. asiatica formulations in models of Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) have been identified to be among the pharmacologically relevant metabolites contributing to the botanical's cognitive enhancement and neuroprotective effects. Isomers of CQAs are, however, difficult to differentiate by commonly used LC-MS techniques, making the characterization, standardization, and batch-to-batch consistency of these formulations challenging. Individual CQAs have unique proton Spin Network Fingerprints (pSNFs) that can be used to distinguish between CQA regioisomers within complex extracts. This work describes the development of a CQA-focused pSNF library that can be used to complement LC-MS methods for the accurate metabolite identification and characterization of bioactive C. asiatica fractions and extracts. The isolation of two new (1 and 2) and four known (3-6) CQAs and CQA analogues from C. asiatica and their contribution to the pSNF library are also discussed herein.",

    "abstract": "Sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a metal-dependent hydrolase that plays key roles in dNTP homeostasis, antiretroviral defense, and regulation of various cancers in humans. Beyond mammals, SAMHD1 is also present in a wide range of eukaryotes, including invertebrates, plants, and human parasites. Although the specific mechanisms and biological significance of SAMHD1 in these organisms are not well understood, its functions are linked to essential processes such as photosynthesis, genome maintenance, and immune response. In this study, we bioinformatically mined the SAMHD1 superfamily and selected the ortholog from the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis as a model system for both fungal and biochemically intractable plant SAMHD1s. Ri SAMHD1 retains the substrate promiscuity of the human enzyme but bypasses the strict requirement for allosteric activation through tetramerization, positioning it as a prototypical enzyme in which hydrolysis and allosteric regulation can be uncoupled. Its activity is selectively dependent on transition metal ions such as Mn and Fe, while Mg serves as a poor activator. Although Ri SAMHD1 lacks several ancillary regulatory features present in human SAMHD1, its activity is differentially modulated by GTP, which acts as an allosteric activator at lower concentrations and an allosteric inhibitor at higher concentrations. These results demonstrate that metal dependence and allosteric regulation are adaptive traits that have evolved divergently among mammals, fungi, and plants, invoking alternative molecular routes for fine-tuning dNTP levels. Our findings on Ri SAMHD1 provide a paradigm for the mechanistic diversification of SAMHD1 enzymes and offer valuable insights for dissecting the complex mechanisms of nucleotide regulation in humans.",

Herein, we present the first total synthesis of the highly functionalized mono- and oligosaccharides of B. hinzii O-antigen for vaccine development. The rare 2,3-diacetamidopyranoses were generated from 3-O-acetyl-2-nitroglycals via an organocatalyzed one-pot relay glycosylation method. The postglycosylation oxidation strategy was used to overcome the poor reactivity of 2,3-diacetamido-aldouronic acid building blocks in glycosylation reactions. Direct amidation of alduronic acid with NH3 in the late stage reduced the protecting group operation and increased the synthetic efficiency. Di-tert-butylsilylidene-directed α-galactosylation method was used to construct challenging 1,2-cis-glycosidic bond. Six oligosaccharides of B. hinzii O-antigen were obtained and further conjugated to human serum albumin for antigenicity evaluation (the sera antibodies were obtained from vaccinated mouse via inactivated B. hinzii). The terminal tetrasaccharide of B. hinzii O-antigen has been identified as a potential glycol-epitope and might be useful for vaccine development against B. hinzii.",

    "abstract": "Ru/C-catalyzed polyethylene (PE) and hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis under quasi-supercritical fluid of isopentane was kinetically and mechanistically investigated. PE hydrogenolysis with C-C and C-H cleavage showed zeroth order, suggesting strong adsorption of hydrocarbons. PE yielded broad product distribution of heavy (C21-40) and diesel-range (C11-20) hydrocarbons in the primary step of hydrogenolysis due to stochastic C-C cleavage over Ru surface. Catalytic hydrogenolysis of n-hexadecane, squalane, and light hydrocarbons such as n-pentane, iso-pentane, and n-hexane further described C-C cleavage reactivity between primary and secondary carbons, i.e., 1C-2C and 2C-2C, which has an order of magnitude higher hydrogenolysis rate than that involving a tertiary carbon. The PE saturated Ru surface and lower C-C cleavage reactivity of tertiary carbon in iso-pentane, therefore, imited sovlent conversion during hydrogenolysis, whereas leading to selective PE conversion. Using hexadecane, we observed comparable hydrogenolysis rates between H2 and D2 (k H /k D ∼ 1), indicating the kinetically relevant step of C-C cleavage with facilitating C-H cleavage and rehydrogenation. However, the normal kinetic isotope effect between hexadecane and deuterated hexadecane (k C16H34 /k C16D34 ∼ 5) revealed that the dehydrogenation, i.e., C-H cleavage, can be kinetically involved in the hydrogenolysis kinetic. By considering the 8-fold lower H-D exchange rate with deuterated hexadecane compared to n-hexadecane, the lower rate for hydrogenolysis and H-D exchange with deuterated hexadecane can be attributed to the C-D bond dissociation energy being 3 kJ/mol higher than that of the C-H bond. Increasing H2 pressure favors internal C-C bond cleavage over terminal one. This minimizes the formation of lower hydrocarbons, particularly methane. However, the increase in H2 pressure increases the coverage of adsorbed hydrogen on the Ru particles due to competitive adsorption of H2 and polyethylene, which, in turn, reduces the polyethylene conversion rates.",

    "abstract": "The simple but essential azetidinone core of the β-lactam antibiotics is uniquely N-sulfonated in the monobactam subfamily. This feature confers both target binding specificity to inactivate bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (antibiosis) and structural differentiation to elude destruction by metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). The recent FDA approval of Emblaveo to treat serious bacterial infections combines an established synthetic monobactam aztreonam and avibactam, which additionally blocks serine β-lactamases, to create a broadly effective antibacterial therapeutic. Here we report experiments to capture the native monobactam biosynthetic steps to the natural product sulfazecin with the aim of accessing new monobactams by reprogramming its biosynthetic machinery. In sulfazecin biosynthesis, the β-lactam ring is formed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase SulM that incorporates l-2,3-diaminopropionate (Dap), which is then N-sulfonated in trans and efficiently cyclized to the fully elaborated monobactam by an unusual thioesterase (TE) domain. We describe an improved synthesis of (2S,3R)-vinylDap to support rational structure-based engineering experiments to obtain the corresponding (4R)-vinyl sulfazecin. While these experiments were initially based on an AlphaFold model of the adenylation domain that incorporates Dap (SulM A3), we further report high-resolution X-ray crystal structures with both the l-Dap substrate and an accurate analogue of the activated (3R)-methyl-Dap adenylate bound. The ligand-bound structures rationalize the inability of SulA3 to incorporate larger substrates. Comparisons with the structures of other diamino acid-activating adenylation domains identify alternate binding modes that may be more suitable for the production of sulfazecin analogues. The impact of these structures on the further engineering of the SulA3 domain and its relation to monobactam synthesis in the recently structurally characterized SulTE are discussed.",

The rich structural variations of Ru-NH 3 in coordinating solvents and an ammonia atmosphere were fully characterized by cyclic voltammograms (CVs), NMR, and XRD. CV experiments showed that Ru-NH 3 promotes electrocatalytic ammonia oxidation at a low overpotential of 0.85 V with a calculated catalytic rate (k obs) of 18.9 s-1. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) at an applied potential of 0.3 V vs Fc+/0 achieves 76.1 equiv of N2 with a faradaic efficiency of 89.8%. Experimental and computational analyses indicated that oxidation of Ru-NH 3 generates a reactive Ru III -NH 3 intermediate, which undergoes sequential electron and proton transfer steps to form a Ru VI ≡N species. N-N bond formation occurs via the nucleophilic attack of an ammonia molecule on the Ru VI ≡N moiety with a facile barrier of 8.6 kcal/mol. Eventually, N2 evolved as the product after releasing two electrons and three protons.",

    "abstract": "The activation of lattice oxygen at low temperatures is essential for heterogeneous catalytic oxidation, but exactly how this is achieved by adjusting the coordination structure of atomic sites is still elusive. Herein, the Cu1O3-CeO2 catalyst with highly dispersed unsaturated Cu1-O3 coordination was creatively engineered, which remarkably enhanced the low-temperature oxidation of CO (a typical model reaction) from 12% to 90% at 66 °C compared to conventional CuCeO x catalyst. The preservation of atomic coordination-deficient Cu sites enables the transfer of electron cloud density from Cu atoms to O atoms, hence, facilitating the activation of lattice oxygen. Further electron transfer from O atom to Cu species results in charge back-donation to form sufficient Cu+ and metal per-oxy species, contributing to weaken O-O bonds. We determined that the increasing number of electron donors induced by unsaturated atomic Cu1-O3 coordination is an efficient strategy to develop highly active and stable catalysts for lattice oxygen activation. The catalyst synthesis strategies and oxygen activation mechanism demonstrated in this work provide a generalizable platform for the future design of well-defined functional catalysts for low-temperature oxidation reactions.",

Here, we present a library of 30 cationic micelle nanoparticles (MNPs) formulated from diblock copolymers with reactive poly(pentafluorophenol acrylate) backbones modified with diverse amines. This library systematically varies in nitrogen-based cationic functionalities, exhibiting a spectrum of properties that encompass varied degrees of alkyl substitution (A1-A5), piperazine (A6), oligoamine (A7), guanidinium (A8), and hydroxylation (A9-A10) that vary in side-chain volume, substitution pattern, hydrophilicity, and pK a to assess parameter impact on mRNA delivery. In vitro delivery assays using GFP+ mRNA across multiple cell lines reveal that amine side-chain bulk and chemical structure critically affect performance. Using machine learning analysis via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) on 180 formulations (3780 experimental measurements), we mapped key relationships between amine chemistry and performance metrics, finding that amine-specific binding efficiency was a major determinant of mRNA delivery efficacy, cell viability, and GFP intensity. Micelles with stronger mRNA binding capabilities (A1 and A7) have higher cellular delivery performance, whereas those with intermediate binding tendencies deliver a higher amount of functional mRNA per cell (A2, A10). This indicates that balancing the binding strength is crucial for performance. Micelles with hydrophobic and bulky pendant groups (A3-A5) tend to induce necrosis during cellular delivery, highlighting the significance of chemical optimization. A7 amphiphile, displaying primary and secondary amine, consistently demonstrates the highest GFP expression across various cell types and in vivo achieves high delivery specificity to lung tissue upon intravenous administration. Moreover, we established a strong correlation between in vitro and in vivo performance using Multitask Gaussian Process models, underscoring the predictive power of in vitro models for anticipating in vivo outcomes. Overall, this innovative study integrates advanced data science with experimental design, demonstrating the pivotal role of chemical amine-dependent optimization for advancing targeted mRNA delivery to the lungs.",

Disruptions in lysosomal function and lipid composition are implicated in a wide range of diseases including lysosomal storage disorders, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Imaging of the lysosomal lipid composition has the potential to not only enhance the understanding of lysosome-related diseases and their progression but also help identify them. In this work, we present a novel viscosity-sensitive, green-emitting BODIPY probe that can distinguish between ordered and disordered lipid phases and selectively internalize into the lysosomal membranes of live cells. Through the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we demonstrate that lysosomal membranes in multiple cancer cells exhibit significantly higher microviscosities compared to noncancer cells. The differences in lysosomal microviscosities provide an effective approach for identifying cancer cells and indicate that malignant cells may possess more oxidized and saturated lysosomal lipid membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of viscosity-sensitive probes in quantifying the compositional changes in lysosomal membranes by investigating the effects of lysosome-permeabilizing cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), sertraline, and astemizole. Our results reveal that despite their functional similarities, these CADs exert opposite effects on lysosomal microviscosities in both cancerous and noncancerous cells, suggesting that different mechanisms may contribute to the CAD-induced lysosomal damage and leakage.",

Inspired by cryptobiosis in nature, chemists have designed and synthesized artificial \"cell-in-shell\" structures, endowed with the protective and functional capabilities of nanoshells. The cell-in-shells hold the potential to overcome the inherent limitations of biologically naı̈ve cells, enabling the acquisition of exogenous phenotypic traits through the chemical process known as single-cell nanoencapsulation (SCNE). This review highlights recent advancements in the development of artificial spores, with sections organized based on the categorization of material types utilized in SCNE, specifically organic, hybrid, and inorganic types. Particular emphasis is placed on the cytoprotective and multifunctional roles of nanoshells, demonstrating potential applications of SCNEd cells across diverse fields, including synthetic biology, biochemistry, materials science, and biomedical engineering. Furthermore, the perspectives outlined in this review propose future research directions in SCNE, with the goal of achieving fine-tuned precision in chemical modulation at both intracellular and pericellular levels, paving the way for the design and construction of customized artificial spores tailored to meet specific functional needs.",

The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product. We also showcase how synergistic experimental and computational investigations have enabled the elucidation of specific noncovalent interactions responsible for selective stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductors form the foundational bedrock of modern electronics and numerous cutting-edge technologies. Particularly, semiconductors crafted from organic building blocks hold immense promise as next-generation pioneers, thanks to their vast array of chemical structures, customizable frontier orbital energy levels and bandgap structures, and easily adjustable π electronic properties. Over the past 50 years, advancements in chemistry and materials science have facilitated extensive investigations into small organic π compounds, oligomers, and polymers, resulting in a rich library of organic semiconductors. However, a longstanding challenge persists: how to organize π building units or chains into well-defined π structures, which are crucial for the performance of organic semiconductors. Consequently, the pursuit of methodologies capable of synthesizing and/or fabricating organic semiconductors with ordered structures has emerged as a frontier in organic and polymeric semiconductor research. In this context, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) stand out as unique platforms allowing for the covalent integration of organic π units into periodically ordered π structures, thus facilitating the development of semiconductors with extended yet precisely defined π architectures. Since their initial report in 2008, significant strides have been made in exploring various chemistries to develop semiconducting COFs, resulting in a rich library of structures, properties, functions, and applications. This review provides a comprehensive yet focused exploration of the general structural features of semiconducting COFs, outlining the basic principles of structural design, illustrating the linkage chemistry and synthetic strategies based on typical one-pot polymerization reactions to demonstrate the growth of bulk materials, nanosheets, films, and membranes. By elucidating the interactions between COFs and various entities such as photons, phonons, electrons, holes, ions, molecules, and spins, this review categorizes semiconducting COFs into nine distinct sections: semiconductors, photoconductors, light emitters, sensors, photocatalysts, photothermal conversion materials, electrocatalysts, energy storage electrodes, and radical spin materials, focusing on disclosing structure-originated properties and functions. Furthermore, this review scrutinizes structure-function correlations and highlights the unique features, breakthroughs, and challenges associated with semiconducting COFs. Furnished with foundational knowledges and state-of-the-art insights, this review predicts the fundamental issues to be addressed and outlines future directions for semiconducting COFs, offering a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving and remarkable field.",

This Review examines key studies to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy. Two DPL methods, in particular, show great promise: organic azide/diazirine cross-linkers (Z-cross-linkers) and UV-cross-linkable organic semiconducting blends (X-blends). These methods not only simplify the photolithography process significantly but also enhance the chemical and physical resistance of patterned organic semiconductors against photolithographic chemicals and tandem solution-depositions. Consequently, these advancements enable the fabrication of organic integrated circuits entirely through solution processes. In conclusion, photolithography of organic semiconductors serves a dual purpose: it facilitates the patterning of active layers for OFETs and acts as an enabling technology for fabricating sophisticated and cost-effective organic integrated circuits.",

    "abstract": "The study of interfacial properties in liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor systems has a history of nearly 200 years, with significant contributions from scientific luminaries such as Thomas Young and Willard Gibbs. However, a similar level of understanding of solid-liquid interfaces has emerged only more recently, largely because of the numerous complications associated with the thermodynamics needed to describe them. The accurate calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid-liquid systems is central to determining which interfaces will be observed and their properties. However, designing and analyzing the molecular dynamics simulations required to do this remains challenging, unlike the liquid-liquid or liquid-vapor cases, because of the unique complications associated with solid-liquid systems. Specifically, the lattice structure of solids introduces spatial directionality, and atomic configurations in solids can be altered by stretching. The primary aim of this review is to provide an overview of the numerical approaches developed to address the challenge of calculating the interfacial free energy in solid-liquid systems. These approaches are classified as (i) direct methods, which compute interfacial free energies explicitly, albeit often through convoluted procedures, and (ii) indirect methods, which derive these free energies as secondary results obtained from the analysis of simulations of an idealized experimental configuration. We also discuss two key topics related to the calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid-liquid systems: nucleation theory and curved interfaces, which represent important problems where research remains highly active.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence emitters with a multiple-resonant (MR) effect have become a research hotspot. These MR emitters mainly consist of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with boron/nitrogen, nitrogen/carbonyl, and indolocarbazole frameworks. The staggered arrangement of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital facilitates MR, resulting in smaller internal reorganization energy and a narrower emission bandwidth. Optimal charge separation suppresses the energy gap between singlet and triplet excited states, favoring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). These MR-TADF materials, due to color purity and high emission efficiency, are excellent candidates for organic light-emitting diodes. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain; in particular, the limitation imposed by the alternated core configuration hinders their diversity and versatility. Most existing MR-TADF materials are concentrated in the blue-green range, with only a few in red and near-infrared spectra. This review provides a timely and comprehensive screening of MR emitters from their pioneering work to the present. Our goal is to gain understandings of the MR-TADF structure-performance relationship from both basic and advanced perspectives. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the correlations between chemical structure, photophysical properties and electroluminescent performance in both depth and breadth with an aim to promote the future development of MR emitters.",

We then identify innovative in situ and operando techniques to directly probe the photoelectrode|electrolyte interface, enabling direct assessment of structure-property relationships for catalytic surfaces in active reaction environments. We close by considering more complex photoelectrochemical fuel-forming reactions (carbon dioxide and nitrogen reduction, as well as alternative oxidation reactions), where product selectivity imposes additional criteria on electrochemical driving force and photoelectrode architecture.

The use of small molecule ligands that bind to amyloid fibrils underpins both fundamental research aiming to better understand the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, and clinical research aiming to develop diagnostic tools for these diseases. To date, a large number of amyloid-binding ligands have been reported in the literature, predominantly targeting protein fibrils composed of amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and α-synuclein (αSyn) fibrils. Fibrils formed by a particular protein can adopt a range of possible morphologies, but protein fibrils formed in vivo possess disease-specific morphologies, highlighting the need for morphology-specific amyloid-binding ligands. This review details the morphologies of Aβ, tau, and αSyn fibril polymorphs that have been reported as a result of structural work and describes a database of amyloid-binding ligands containing 4,288 binding measurements for 2,404 unique compounds targeting Aβ, tau, or αSyn fibrils.",

Furthermore, we introduce Deterministic Benchmarking (DB), a novel protocol that minimizes the number of experimental runs, exhibits resilience to SPAM errors, and effectively characterizes both coherent and incoherent errors. The implementation of DB is experimentally validated using a superconducting transmon qubit, and the results are substantiated with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations.

Three distinct confinement regimes are usually recognized: the weak, intermediate, and strong confinement regimes. Which of these is relevant depends on the relative size of the quantum dot in terms of the exciton Bohr radius. However, this classification is primarily based on the linear optical properties of the nanocrystal. During the transition from the molecule to the bulk crystal, structural, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties change as well. In this review, we discuss the cluster regime, where the exciton experiences extreme confinement. In the cluster regime, not only do linear optical properties deviate significantly from the effective mass approximation, but other material properties also begin to deviate from their bulk values. These deviations are only observable in the size regime, where the intrinsic length scales are much smaller than the exciton Bohr radius. Crucially, computational methods allow chemists to explore this region far more quantitatively than in the past.",

    "abstract": "In the information age, novel hardware solutions are urgently needed to efficiently store and process increasing amounts of data. In this scenario, memory devices must evolve significantly to provide the necessary bit capacity, performance, and energy efficiency needed in computation. In particular, novel computing paradigms have emerged to minimize data movement, which is known to contribute the largest amount of energy consumption in conventional computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture. In-memory computing (IMC) provides a means to compute within data with minimum data movement and excellent energy efficiency and performance. To meet these goals, resistive-switching random-access memory (RRAM) appears to be an ideal candidate thanks to its excellent scalability and nonvolatile storage. However, circuit implementations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models require highly specialized device properties that need careful RRAM device engineering. This work addresses the RRAM concept from materials, device, circuit, and application viewpoints, focusing on the physical device properties and the requirements for storage and computing applications. Memory applications, such as embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) in novel microcontroller units (MCUs) and storage class memory (SCM), are highlighted. Applications in IMC, such as hardware accelerators of neural networks, data query, and algebra functions, are illustrated by referring to the reported demonstrators with RRAM technology, evidencing the remaining challenges for the development of a low-power, sustainable AI.",

Among the known methods of olefin production, semihydrogenation of the C-C triple bond seems to be the most straightforward one. Nonetheless, the success of this reaction requires full control over diastereoselectivity, eradication of a parasitic process of over-reduction or migration of the C-C double bond formed, and achieving satisfactory functional-group compatibility. The review demonstrates developments in the field of alkyne semihydrogenation over the period 2010-2022, with selected papers published in 2023 and 2024, emphasizing solutions to the above-mentioned limitations. We discuss mechanistic aspects of this transformation, including those related to unconventional systems. The review includes examples of applications of alkyne semihydrogenation in organic synthesis, confirming the considerable utility of this process. Finally, strategies to enhance catalyst selectivity are summarized.

These agents, while impactful, still suffer from limitations including a lack of oral bioavailability, high cost of production, and immunogenicity. Small-molecule cytokine inhibitors are attractive alternatives that can address these limitations. Although targeting cytokine-cytokine receptor complexes with small molecules has been a challenging research endeavor, multiple small-molecule inhibitors have now been identified, with a number of them undergoing clinical evaluation. In this review, we highlight the recent advancements in the discovery and development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting soluble cytokines. The strategies for identifying these novel ligands as well as the structural and mechanistic insights into their activity represent important milestones in tackling these challenging and clinically important protein-protein interactions.",

Over the years of dedicated research, several types of chemiresistive gas sensors have been realized with appreciable sensitivities toward various gases. However, critical issues such as poor selectivity and sluggish response/recovery speeds continue to impede their widespread commercialization. Specifically, the mechanisms behind the selective response of some chemiresistive materials toward specific gas analytes remain unclear. In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art strategies employed to attain gas-selective chemiresistive materials, with particular emphasis on materials design, surface modification or functionalization with catalysts, defect engineering, material structure control, and integration with physical/chemical gas filtration media. The nature of material surface-gas interactions and the supporting mechanisms are elucidated, opening opportunities for optimizing the materials design, fine-tuning the gas sensing performance, and guiding the selection of the most appropriate materials for the accurate detection of specific gases.

Many disease-associated changes are hard-wired within the surfaceome, yet approved drugs target less than 50 cell surface proteins.

In this review, we first dive into the unique characteristics and functions of the surfaceome, emphasizing the necessity for specialized labeling, enrichment, and proteomic approaches. An overview of surfaceomics methods is provided, detailing techniques to measure changes in protein expression and how this leads to novel target discovery. Next, we highlight advances in proximity labeling proteomics (PLP), showcasing how various enzymatic and photoaffinity proximity labeling techniques can map protein-protein interactions and membrane protein complexes on the cell surface. We then review the role of extracellular post-translational modifications, focusing on cell surface glycosylation, proteolytic remodeling, and the secretome. Finally, we discuss methods for identifying tumor-specific peptide MHC complexes and how they have shaped therapeutic development. This emerging field of neo-protein epitopes is constantly evolving, where targets are identified at the proteome level and encompass defined disease-associated PTMs, complexes, and dysregulated cellular and tissue locations. Given the functional importance of the surfaceome for biology and therapy, we view surfaceomics as a critical piece of this quest for neo-epitope target discovery.",

Over the past decade, the evolution of DNA- and RNA-based technologies combined with the innovation of state-of-the-art delivery vehicles for nucleic acids has brought rapid advancements to the biopharmaceutical field. Nucleic acid therapies have the potential to achieve long-lasting effects, or even cures, by inhibiting or editing genes, which is not possible with conventional small-molecule drugs. However, challenges and limitations must be addressed before these therapies can provide cures for chronic conditions and rare diseases, rather than only offering temporary relief. Nucleic acids and proteins face premature degradation in the acidic, enzyme-rich stomach environment and are rapidly cleared by the liver.

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology has played an important role in the renaissance of natural products research during the post-genomics era. The development and integration of new tools have transformed the workflow of natural product discovery and engineering, generating multidisciplinary interest in the field. In this review, we summarize recent developments in natural product biosynthesis from three different aspects. First, advances in bioinformatics, experimental, and analytical tools to identify natural products associated with predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) will be covered. This will be followed by an extensive review on the heterologous expression of natural products in bacterial, fungal and plant organisms. The native host-independent paradigm to natural product identification, pathway characterization, and enzyme discovery is where synthetic biology has played the most prominent role. Lastly, strategies to engineer biosynthetic pathways for structural diversification and complexity generation will be discussed, including recent advances in assembly-line megasynthase engineering, precursor-directed structural modification, and combinatorial biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Thermoelectric materials hold great potential for direct conversion of ubiquitous waste heat into electricity. However, their commercialization is hindered by low efficiency, reliance on rare and expensive Te, and limited stability under operating conditions. This review explores recent advances in novel strategies for achieving high thermoelectric performance and stability in Te-free inorganic bulk materials. First, we discuss diverse innovative techniques aimed at substantially enhancing electrical transport properties. These methods encompass strategies such as charge carrier engineering, band convergence, band inversion, valley anisotropy, multiband synglisis, and the incorporation of resonant levels or midgap states. Then we focus on strategies to reduce lattice thermal conductivity, including phonon scattering induced by multidimensional defects, off-center doping, resonance scattering, and lattice softening. Additionally, this review presents strategies for decoupling electron and phonon transport to enhance the thermoelectric performance of materials further. The strategies include interface engineering, crystal symmetry manipulation, high-entropy engineering and nanostructuring, high-pressure technology, and magnetically enhanced thermoelectrics. Moreover, we highlight novel strategies for improving the chemical and thermal stability of materials under operating conditions. Last, we discuss current controversies and challenges and suggest future directions for further research to improve the thermoelectric performance of Te-free bulk materials.",

    "abstract": "4D printing is a groundbreaking technology that seamlessly integrates additive manufacturing with smart materials, enabling the creation of multiscale objects capable of changing shapes and/or functions in a controlled and programmed manner in response to applied energy inputs. Printing technologies, mathematical modeling, responsive materials, stimuli, and structural design constitute the blueprint of 4D printing, all of which have seen rapid advancement in the past decade. These advancements have opened up numerous possibilities for dynamic and adaptive structures, finding potential use in healthcare, textiles, construction, aerospace, robotics, photonics, and electronics. However, current 4D printing primarily focuses on proof-of-concept demonstrations. Further development is necessary to expand the range of accessible materials and address fabrication complexities for widespread adoption. In this paper, we aim to deliver a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in 4D printing, probing into shape programming, exploring key aspects of resulting constructs including printing technologies, materials, structural design, morphing mechanisms, and stimuli-responsiveness, and elaborating on prominent applications across various fields. Finally, we discuss perspectives on limitations, challenges, and future developments in the realm of 4D printing.

    "abstract": "Chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) have emerged as highly effective Brønsted acid catalysts in an expanding range of asymmetric transformations, often through novel multifunctional substrate activation modes. Versatile and broadly appealing, these catalysts benefit from modular and tunable structures, and compatibility with additives. Given the unique types of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) that can be established between CPAs and various reactants─such as hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions, and van der Waals forces─it is unsurprising that these catalyst systems have become a promising approach for accessing diverse chiral product outcomes. This review aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms by which CPAs impart stereoselectivity, positioning NCIs as the central feature that connects a broad spectrum of catalytic reactions. Spanning literature from 2004 to 2024, it covers nucleophilic additions, radical transformations, and atroposelective bond formations, highlighting the applicability of CPA organocatalysis. Special emphasis is placed on the structural and mechanistic features that govern CPA-substrate interactions, as well as the tools and techniques developed to enhance our understanding of their catalytic behavior. In addition to emphasizing mechanistic details and stereocontrolling elements in individual reactions, we have carefully structured this review to provide a natural progression from these specifics to a broader, class-level perspective. Overall, these findings underscore the critical role of NCIs in CPA catalysis and their significant contributions to advancing asymmetric synthesis.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe exploitation of combustion of materials stands as a cornerstone of early human development. A theoretical framework for this field began to take shape only around 1700 and finally achieved a sound foundation through the electronic quantum-chemical oxidation concepts of the 20th century. Eventually, a decade ago the IUPAC defined the essential rules for a unique definition of atomic oxidation states (OS) or OS numbers in molecules and extended structures. In specific cases, however, these rules need be tailored to specific chemical observations, including amazing experiences with the heaviest elements. We review our findings and updated interpretations, particularly with regard to previously unexpected trends in the highest oxidation states (HOS) of heavy atomic compounds.The HOS is a qualitative integer parameter for characterizing the chemistry of an element. It is determined by three basic factors: (i) by the number g of loosely bound electrons in the atom's valence shell, usually related to its group number G in the periodic table (g = G mod 10, with mod meaning g = 2 to 8 for G = 12-18); (ii) by the fraction of these g electrons that can be chemically activated and may fall below g toward the end of a series; and (iii) by the local and long-range \"environmental\" conditions (mainly the interaction strengths of the ligands), which range from those in normal life, laboratories and industry, to more extreme conditions such as deep inside the Earth, outside in cosmic space, or in special laboratories.In recent years, our group has systematically investigated the regularity of the HOS over the periodic table, in particular the electronic structures of compounds of various d- (transition metals) and f-block elements (lanthanides and actinides), applying both density-functional approximations and more advanced quantum-chemical methods. Details of the HOS values in the border ranges of feasibility, depending on thermodynamic environment and ligand-interaction capabilities, are conceptually analyzed, incorporating also discoveries of other researchers. The patterns of the HOS from the light s- and sp- to the heavy d- and f-block elements are elucidated, showing systematic deviations from simple textbook rules. The particularly large and small Core-Valence (CV) orbital-energy gaps at, respectively, the upper-right and lower-left corners of the periodic table interrupt the regular trends of the HOS of the sp-block elements, causing HOS < g (as for O or Pt) or HOS > g (as for Cs or Ra). On the other hand, the d-transition metals (TM) and also the actinide 5f-series (An) in the middle of the periodic table show a more uniform variation of the HOS with one common maximum at 8(±1), while the lanthanide 4f-series (Ln) shows two lower HOS maxima, due to their peculiarly small 4f-orbital radii and varying energies.Our report is intended both as a summary of knowledge, as a distillation of new insights, and as a roadmap for further research into the oxidation phenomena.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusRadical migration represents a powerful strategy for reaction discovery and development in organic synthesis, offering access to unprecedented functional molecules and chemical space. In this Account, we describe our contributions to the field, particularly focusing on 1,2-radical acyloxy migration (RAM), a process involving the transposition of a radical and an acyloxy group. We highlight its application in carbohydrate modification and allyl carboxylate trifunctionalization, demonstrating how this reactivity enables the streamlined synthesis of novel glycomimetics and facilitates selective 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. These advances establish 1,2-RAM as a versatile platform for catalytic radical transformations, unlocking new opportunities in reaction development and functional molecule design.Our approach leverages excited-state palladium and ground-state nickel catalysis to modify carbohydrates, specifically at the C2 position. This strategy enables C2-deoxy-hydrogenation, deuteration, iodination, alkenylation, allylation, ketonylation, and arylation reactions, providing direct access to unprecedented glycomimetics. These transformations streamline the synthesis of structurally diverse glycomimetics, facilitating the discovery and development of carbohydrate-based functional molecules. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance of these catalytic systems make them particularly attractive for late-stage functionalization, broadening their applicability in complex molecule synthesis.Beyond carbohydrates, we have extended 1,2-RAM reactivity to achieve unprecedented 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. By employing excited-state phosphine catalysis, we demonstrate a 1,3-carbobromination reaction accompanied by an acyloxy shift. This proof-of-concept study lays the foundation for developing a broader range of 1,2,3-trifunctionalization reactions, effectively transforming allyl carboxylates into substituted isopropyl carboxylate donors. This advancement expands the synthetic utility of allyl carboxylates, enabling the rapid construction of structurally diverse molecular scaffolds.In summary, the 1,2-RAM reactivity opens a new avenue for reaction discovery and development, granting access to new functional molecules and chemical space. The mild conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and unique reactivity of this approach make it a valuable tool for chemical synthesis. We anticipate that merging 1,2-RAM with other catalytic platforms will further advance bond disconnection strategies, provide access to new functional molecules, and expand the frontiers of chemical synthesis.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe bacterial cell wall is a complex structure that is primarily composed of peptidoglycan (PG), which provides protection from the environment and structural rigidity for the cell. As such, PG plays an important role in bacterial survival, which has made its biosynthesis a crucial target for antibiotic development for many decades. Despite long-standing efforts to inhibit PG construction, much remains unknown about the enzymes required for PG biosynthesis or how PG composition and architecture are altered to enable adaptation to environmental stressors. This knowledge will be crucial in the identification of new ways to interfere with PG construction that could overcome widespread resistance to cell wall-targeting antibacterial agents.All bacterial species possess a suite of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are critical actors in PG construction and remodeling, as well as the main targets of β-lactam antibiotics. While the importance of the PBPs is well-known, the field lacks a complete understanding of PBP activity regulation, localization, and critical protein-protein interactions during the growth and division process. Bacteria possess between 4 and 16 PBP homologues with only one or several being genetically essential in each cell. A key outstanding question about these proteins is why bacteria expend the energy required to maintain this relatively large number of related proteins when so few are required to maintain life. The Carlson lab focuses on the development of chemical tools to address this fundamental question. In particular, we have generated a suite of chemical probes to selectively target one or a small number of PBP homologues in their catalytically active state. These activity-based probes (ABPs) have and will continue to enable a deeper understanding of the traits that differentiate the PBPs over the bacterial lifespan.In this account, we discuss the development of selective chemical tools to study the PBPs. Key to our success has been assessment of the PBP inhibition profiles of an expansive set of commercially available β-lactams in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This work has directly identified molecules that can be used in chemical genetic studies and provided scaffolds for the generation of PBP-selective ABPs. We also discovered a novel β-lactone scaffold that is exquisitely selective for PBPs over other protein classes and targets a different subclass of these proteins than related β-lactams. Using these probes, we have explored PG biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis yielding new insights about their cell wall construction and remodeling processes, as well as specialized activities under stress.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusCarbon-based materials─often with superlative electronic, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties─are often categorized by dimensionality and hybridization. Most of these categories are produced in high-temperature conditions that afford equilibrium-dictated structures, but limit their diversity. In contrast, an emerging class of one-dimensional (1D) carbon materials, coined nanothreads, are accessible through kinetically controlled solid-state reactions of small multiply unsaturated molecules. While abundant in molecular organic synthesis, exerting kinetic control over reactivity is a revolutionary approach to access dense carbon networks. Owing to their internal diamond-like core, these materials are calculated to span a wide range of mechanical and optical properties, with the introduction of functional groups and/or heteroatoms leading to tailorable band gaps and the potential to access electronic states that are not featured in traditional polymers or nanomaterials. Accessing these properties requires the ability to precisely control solid-state molecular reaction pathways, chemical connectivity, and heteroatom/functional group density. Carbon nanothreads are often synthesized through the pressure-induced polymerization of aromatic molecules (e.g., benzene, pyridine, and thiophene) upon compression to 23-40 GPa. While the high pressures required to achieve these crystalline materials often preclude making synthetically viable quantities of product, the use of lessened aromatic reactants, along with light and/or heat, enables more mild reaction pressures. Success to date in forming nanothreads from diverse reactants suggests that physical organic principles govern the reaction, along with topochemical relationships, enabling the emergence of a new field of carbon chemistry that combines the control of organic chemistry with the range of physical properties only possible in extended periodic solids.In this Account, we describe our efforts to rationally synthesize carbon nanothreads with desired structures and present our approaches to dictate reactivity in the organic solid state that enable the formation of crystalline 1D carbon materials. In particular, we focus on the principles being pursued by our group to expand the chemical diversity of materials being accessed, while highlighting efforts that both enhance selectivity over reaction pathways and reduce pressure requirements for polymerization. We begin by leveraging starting materials with lessened or no aromaticity (relative to benzene) to design new backbones while enabling lower pressures such as 15-20 GPa to achieve nanothread formation. Next, we discuss efforts to utilize photochemical activation as a means to dictate the reaction pathway and/or affect the mechanism while also achieving ordered crystalline solids at reduced pressures. Lastly, we highlight efforts to demonstrate kinetic control in solid-state reactions by leveraging supramolecular chemistry (e.g., aryl/perfluoroaryl interactions, hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking) to preorganize starting materials into polymerizable molecular stacks. The resultant design principles provide multiple opportunities to attain previously inaccessible sp3-rich 1D polymeric carbon nanomaterials with unique structures and properties from widely available small molecules. Moreover, the kinetic control provided in the organic solid state enables a priori functionalization and the design of a rich diversity of materials with emergent properties in stark contrast to many well-developed carbon materials.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn this Accounts article, we summarize our recent work on truncating conjugated two-dimensional framework materials down to a single pore, or a single macrocycle. Conjugated 2D architectures have emerged as one of the most synthetically adaptable motifs for coupling semiconductivity and porosity in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, despite their prevalence, 2D architectures have several limitations. In particular, the strong interlayer π-π stacking can limit both processability and the accessibility of internal active sites. We have found that simple macrocycles preserve key aspects of 2D framework structure and function, including porosity and out-of-plane electrical conductivity, while providing improved processability, surface tunability, and mass transport properties. In this article, we first describe our synthetic approach and general design considerations. Specifically, we show how ditopic analogues of the tritopic ligands commonly found in the synthesis of 2D MOFs and COFs can be used to achieve a diverse library of conjugated macrocycles that resemble fragments of semiconducting frameworks in both form and function. The length of the peripheral side chains, the size of the aromatic core, and the solubility of intermediates are all key variables in favoring selective macrocycle formation over undesired linear polymers and oligomers. Next, we highlight the unique advantages that macrocycles provide, including improved processability, atomically precise surface tunability, and greater active site accessibility. In particular, the identity of the peripheral side chains dramatically impacts both solubility and colloidal stability as well as crystal size and morphology. We further show how the solution processability and nanoscale dimensions of macrocycles can simplify electronic device fabrication and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, we end with a forward-looking discussion on how macrocycles offer a unique bridge between conjugated molecules and extended frameworks, enabling new application areas and fundamental science.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe ongoing accumulation of plastic waste in landfills and in the environment is driving research on chemical processes and catalysts to recycle polymers. Traditional modeling strategies are not applicable to these processes because they involve too many reactants and intermediates, one for each molecular weight and each functionalization. To model the kinetics, we have developed population balance models (PBMs) that account for macromolecular reactants in the bulk and macromolecular catalytic intermediates. These PBMs couple to each other through polymer adsorption and desorption models and to traditional rate equations for small molecule products and co-reactants (like hydrogen or ethylene). The models, in combination with experimental data, are being used in many ways: (i) to test mechanistic hypotheses, (ii) to extract rate parameters, (iii) to quantitatively compare catalyst activities, (iv) to account for mass transfer and vapor-liquid partitioning in two-phase reactors, and (v) to design novel support architectures and catalysts that mimic the processive action of natural depolymerization enzymes. Some key theoretical advances allow PBMs to be constructed from elementary rates and mechanisms, as opposed to traditional formulations with pseudoelementary rate parameters invoked as fitting parameters. We discuss ways to build these models \"bottom-up\" from first-principles calculations and ways to extract model parameters from \"top down\" analyses of rate data. The combination provides a quantitative bridge between first-principles calculations and the kinetics of complex macromolecular transformations for polymer upcycling and beyond.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusAdsorptive and membrane separations are recognized as highly energy-efficient technologies, critically dependent on the properties of adsorbent and membrane materials. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs), such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal-organic cages (MOCs), and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), have emerged as exceptional candidates for high-performance adsorbents and membranes due to their intrinsic structural tunability. Their orderly pore structure, high porosity, and large surface facilitate gas storage and separation processes. Furthermore, modifying the inner surface, controlling the pore size, and regulating the framework flexibility can significantly enhance CPMs' adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Therefore, the precise structure regulation of CPMs is the key to optimizing gas separation and purification.Reticular chemistry is the use of strong chemical bonds to connect discrete molecular structures (molecules or molecular clusters) to create extended structures, such as CPMs. It allows precise atomic-level control and offers a method for regulating the structures of CPMs, enabling tailored pore environments that enhance selectivity for target separations. This approach is crucial to designing effective gas separation materials. For example, by functionalizing organic ligands, regulating metal ions, and modifying secondary building units, the pore size, porosity, and functionality of CPMs can be finely controlled while keeping the framework topology unchanged, thereby optimizing the gas separation performance.In this Account, we present an overview of our group's research efforts on optimizing gas separation by fine-tuning CPM adsorbents and membranes. Using reticular chemistry, we have developed strategies such as multiple cooperative regulation, adaptive pore control, pore environment engineering, preprocessed monomer interfacial polymerization, and precursor solution processing to create highly selective CPM adsorbents and membranes. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of multiple hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions between CPMs and hydrocarbon molecules. By precise structural regulation, we further optimize the gas separation performance and broaden CPMs' applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for CPM adsorbents and membranes, including material design, synthesis, stability, performance, and the structure-activity relationship. We also propose a membrane-adsorptive separation coupling technology as a potential solution for achieving high-purity gas separation. By utilizing CPM-based adsorbents and membranes, we aim to establish an energy-intensive and environmentally friendly pathway for the separation of low-carbon hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and natural gas, providing a sustainable alternative to conventional high-energy gas separation processes.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSingle-atom skeletal editing strategies that precisely modify the core frameworks of molecules have the potential to streamline and accelerate organic synthesis by enabling conceptually simple, but otherwise synthetically challenging, retrosynthetic disconnections. In contrast to broader skeletal remodeling and rearrangement strategies, these methodologies more specifically target single-atom changes with high selectivity, even within complex molecules such as natural products or pharmaceuticals. For the past several years, our laboratory has developed several skeletal editing methodologies, including single-atom ring contractions, expansions, and transpositions of both saturated and unsaturated heterocycles, as well as other carbon scaffolds. This Account details the evolution of \"skeletal editing logic\" within the context of our extensive work on natural product total synthesis.Early work in the Sarpong group leveraged metal-mediated C-C bond cleavage of in situ-generated strained intermediates to accomplish total syntheses of natural products, such as the icetexane diterpenoids and cyathane diterpenes. Continuing our focus on leveraging C-C bond cleavage through \"break-it-to-make-it\" strategies, we then developed carvone remodeling strategies to access a variety of terpenoids (including longiborneol sesquiterpenoids, phomactins, and xishacorenes) from hydroxylated pinene derivatives. In applying this skeletal remodeling and C-C cleavage framework to alkaloid natural products, such as the preparaherquimides and lycodine-type alkaloids, we recognized that single-atom changes to the saturated nitrogen-containing rings within these natural products would enable the direct conversion between distinct but structurally related natural product families. Thus, we began developing methods that selectively modify the core frameworks of N-heterocycles; this focus led to our work on the deconstructive fluorination and diversification of piperidines and ultimately to our recent body of work on direct, single-atom core framework modifications (single-atom skeletal editing). In the context of saturated heterocycles, we developed photomediated enantioselective ring contractions of α-acylated motifs and reductive ring contractions of cyclic hydroxylamines. For unsaturated heterocycles, we have developed ring contractions of azines (e.g., pyrimidine to pyrazole), 15N isotopic labeling of azines, and phototranspositions of indazoles to benzimidazoles. To direct our focus on reaction development, a cheminformatic analysis of heteroaromatic skeletal edits served to quantitatively inform which transformations would most significantly expand the accessible chemical space. Apart from heterocycles, we also reported single-nitrogen insertion through the reductive amination of carbonyl C-C bonds. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop mild and selective skeletal editing methodologies that can be applied to total synthesis and organic synthesis more generally. While recent total syntheses from our group have targeted simplified retrosyntheses through single-atom skeletal editing logic (e.g., daphenylline and harringtonolide), multiple steps were still required to achieve the formal desired \"edit\". As such, the continued development of truly single-step, mild, and selective reactions that can edit the cores of highly complex molecules remains highly desirable.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe world's plastics production continues to grow and could triple by 2060. Unfortunately, only a small proportion of these plastics are currently recycled (around 30%). The remainder is incinerated (around 40%), causing high greenhouse gas emissions, or buried (around 30%), resulting in high levels of microplastic pollution. Ambitious national and international policies have been put in place to increase the proportion of recycled plastics, and major research efforts are underway to improve plastic recycling processes. Unfortunately, all recycling processes (chemical, physical, and biological) require batches of plastics to be recycled that are as homogeneous as possible. Rigorous waste sorting is therefore essential, and marking plastics with luminescent markers could provide a solution. It could also enable circular and short-loop recycling in which an object is recycled into an identical object.Heterolanthanide coordination polymers are particularly promising candidates for this application. They have demonstrated their effectiveness in the field of anticounterfeiting marking. However, their use in materials traceability requires other assets, such as markers with luminescence properties that are sufficiently different and sufficiently intense for them to be easily identified on a rapid sorting line, as laboratory analysis is no longer relevant for this application.To prepare such a range of compounds, it is necessary to master the mechanisms that govern luminescence properties. The choice of ligand and metal centers, crystal structure, and particle shaping all have a major influence on luminescence properties. Our group has been working on understanding these phenomena for some 20 years.Using as an example the family of heterolanthanide coordination polymers with general chemical formula [Ln2(bdc)3(H2O)4]∞, where bdc2- represents benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate, we wish to present here the various levers that can be used to modulate the emission colors and increase the luminescence intensity of heterolanthanide coordination polymers and describe a family of markers that can be used in the field of materials traceability. Beyond the choice of the metallic centers and of the ligands, markers can be designed in the form of core-shell particles, with an intermediate optically nonactive insulating shell that separates the core from the shell that are both made of optically active molecular alloys. Intermetallic energy transfers are therefore minimized, resulting in increased luminescence intensity and emission color modulation. In conclusion, we would like to draw up a rough sketch of what could be the markers used in the field of plastics traceability.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSingle atom catalysis has garnered widespread attention in the past decade. In general, single atom catalysis refers to a catalytic process involving the participation of single atom sites. A single atom site refers to an active site with only one metal atom playing the main role in the catalysis process. This metal atom is usually coordinated by other atoms in the active site and anchored on the support. Heterogeneous catalysts in which all active sites are single atom sites are referred to as single atom site catalysts (SASCs). Owing to their distinctive active site architecture, single atom catalysis has shown ultrahigh atomic utilization efficiency and unique catalytic activity and selectivity in many systems such as thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.However, the preparation of SASCs poses significant challenges as metal species tend to sinter and agglomerate during high-temperature treatment. In the past decade, we have challenged the controllable preparation of SASCs based on more than ten years of experience in nanomaterial synthesis. Several representative SASC preparation strategies have been proposed by our group, such as pyrolysis of MOFs with metal ions doped in the skeleton, M@ZIF-8 with a metal precursor fixed by the host-guest interaction, and M/N-rich support precursors. Additionally, \"top-down\" strategies starting from metal nanoparticles have been established. Based on these synthetic strategies, a systematic SASCs toolbox has been successfully built.In addition to the SASCs, we have expanded the toolbox to include the dual-atom-site catalysts (DASCs) (including active sites with dual active metal atoms or including dual kinds of single atom sites) and nanosingle-atom-site catalysts (NSASCs) (catalysts with both single atom sites and nanoparticle/cluster sites). With the help of a variety of \"tools\" in the toolbox, single atom catalysis has shown its application value in many important processes such as bulk chemical catalysis, fine chemical catalysis, energy catalysis, and environmental catalysis. Based on laboratory-scale research, we further explored the feasibility of single atom catalysis in industrial catalysis and successfully applied single atom catalysis to industrial-level automobile exhaust purification, which will soon achieve commercialization.This Account provides a concise overview of the evolution of single atom catalysis, summarizes the preparation strategies for SASCs pioneered by our group over the past decade, and highlights the SASCs toolbox developed through these strategies. We also showcase the practical applications of the SASCs toolbox in key catalytic fields, highlight our progress in advancing the industrialization of single atom catalysis (particularly for automobile exhaust purification), and discuss the future prospects of single atom catalysis in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusOxidative decarboxylative coupling (ODC) reactions have been recognized as powerful alternatives to traditional cross-coupling reactions due to the ability to generate (hetero)biaryl structures from simple and readily available carboxylic acid precursors. These reactions, however, are underdeveloped due to the requirement for ortho-nitrobenzoate coupling partners and silver salts as oxidants. Our research program has focused on the development of new catalytic ODC reactions, as well as mechanistic studies of these reactions to uncover the origin of these synthetic limitations. As the framework for these studies, we explored two key ODC reactions developed in our group: (1) a Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation reaction that relies on silver as the oxidant and (2) a Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction capable of operating under aerobic conditions. Our findings, disclosed in this Account, have uncovered the importance of the ortho-substituent and revealed that Ag-based oxidants are also responsible for mediating the decarboxylation and transmetalation steps.Systematic exploration of the decarboxylation of a series of well-defined Ag-benzoate complexes allowed us to probe the importance of the ortho-nitro group in the decarboxylation step. Kinetic measurements of a large series of differently substituted benzoates were found to correlate with the field effect (F) of the ortho-substituent, revealing this feature to be responsible for the enhanced reactivity of these favored benzoates.Our studies of the Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation reaction uncovered an unexpected redox transmetalation step in this system. Synthesis and isolation of the proposed nickelacycle and Ag-aryl intermediates enabled direct study of the fundamental coupling steps. Catalytic and stoichiometric reactions of these complexes, paired with DFT calculations, supported a redox transmetalation step in which the Ag-aryl intermediate transfers the aryl ligand from AgI to NiII with concomitant oxidation to generate a NiIII-bis(aryl) intermediate.Finally, detailed mechanistic studies of our Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction demonstrated how this catalyst system is able to use O2 as the terminal oxidant. Kinetic studies paired with the synthesis and reactivity of well-defined copper intermediates revealed decarboxylation from a CuI-benzoate resting state, despite the oxidizing reaction conditions which could support higher oxidation state intermediates. We also identified the intermediacy of diphenyl disulfide (PhSSPh) formed from the thiophenol (PhSH) coupling partner under the aerobic Cu-catalyzed conditions. The reaction of PhSSPh with the catalyst proceeds via oxidative transfer of the PhS fragment to CuI that is analogous to that of the redox transmetalation observed in Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation.These studies combined suggest significant implications for ODC reactions more broadly. For example, it appears that silver is important for mediating the decarboxylation step when the catalyst is unable (as is the case with nickel) but is not needed when the catalyst is an efficient decarboxylation mediator on its own (as with copper). Furthermore, silver plays an additional role in mediating an oxidative transfer of the coupling partner in arylation reactions but is not required when the coupling partner is itself oxidizing (such as PhSSPh). We anticipate that these mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of new ODC reactions that operate under milder conditions and with broader substrate scopes.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusMethodological development in the fields of genetics, chemical biology, and biochemistry over the last several decades has provided researchers with a diverse set of powerful tools to investigate biological processes. Leveraging these innovations in concert, scientists can now characterize biological pathways at a level of complexity ranging from systems biology down to molecular and atomic detail.Throughout this Account, we illustrate how discoveries made using these tools build on each other to develop a comprehensive understanding of biological pathways. Advancements in genetic sequencing facilitates association of genotypes and phenotypes, independent of biochemical mechanism. Through the biochemical reconstitution of the interactions between biological macromolecules─including the small molecules (ligands and metabolites) and proteins─that participate in these biological pathways, scientists can characterize the specific molecular features that link genotype and phenotype. This facilitates identification of targets within these pathways that can be manipulated to achieve a greater understanding of the biological process or to develop interventions to improve human health outcomes.Specifically, we describe how this toolbox was leveraged to discover and characterize the molecular biochemistry underlying control of pathogenicity in the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Concurrent with advancements in the investigative tools available to the scientific community, we and others reported on the genetic, molecular, and biochemical/biophysical components of this regulatory system. Virulence control in S. aureus is achieved through a chemical system of bacterial cell-to-cell communication indexed to local population density, referred to as quorum sensing (QS). We and our collaborators identified that this QS system is encoded in the accessory gene regulator (agr) operon and functions via the biosynthesis, secretion, and accumulation of a short peptide signaling molecule─the autoinducing peptide (AIP)─in the local environment correlated with the growth of S. aureus in the same biological niche. Above a threshold concentration, these AIPs bind and activate a cell-surface receptor to stimulate an intracellular response resulting in altered gene expression and bacterial group behaviors. We discovered that chemical modification of these AIPs often generates molecules that exhibit potent inhibition of agr QS, with demonstrated therapeutic potential to treat S. aureus infections. We went on to characterize the biochemical mechanism of signaling molecule biosynthesis and receptor activation in controlled systems through in vitro reconstitution of the constituent enzymes and substrates. Biochemical reconstitution enabled quantitative assessment of biophysical parameters. These efforts culminated in the comprehensive characterization and functional in vitro reconstitution of agr QS in a synthetic system in a minimal model at the interface of genotype, mechanism, and phenotype.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusPolymer self-assembly plays a crucial role across various fields, such as biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Over the years, self-assembly in solution has attracted significant interest. In 2007, our group, in collaboration with Prof. Ian Manners, published a groundbreaking article in Science on living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of amphiphilic block copolymers featuring a crystalline core-forming block. This study focused on polyferrocenylsilane block copolymers (PFS BCPs). Living CDSA operates similarly to living polymerization, enabling the precise fabrication of micelles with predictable shapes and dimensions. The crystalline nature of the core-forming block promotes the formation of structures with low interfacial curvature, such as cylinders and platelets, which are rarely formed in traditional self-assembly techniques based on microphase separation.Over the past two decades, we have pioneered a range of strategies to create one-dimensional (1D), 2D, 3D, and hierarchical uniform PFS BCP structures via CDSA. This method has also been extended to other semicrystalline polymer systems to produce regular and uniform assemblies. While 1D and 2D micelles have been extensively studied, the fabrication of 3D structures remains relatively rare. Nature, however, possesses exquisite 3D structures. Although CDSA has generated some 3D structures, it has not yet achieved the complexity found in nature. Researchers continue to push boundaries toward creating more intricate 3D structures.In this Account, we summarize our research advancements on 3D structure fabrication via CDSA. The free energy of the system, influenced by various factors, ultimately determines micellar morphology and growth behavior. Our work has led to the formation of branched structures through multistep seeded growth processes, incorporating PFS homopolymers (HP) with PFS BCP, manipulating the cooling rate, adjusting the corona block composition, controlling polymer dispersity, and varying solvents. Further innovations involved the use of organic sacrificial templates to produce hollow fiber-basket polymersomes and the application of inorganic substrates for surface micelle growth, yielding organic-inorganic hybrid materials with tailored functionalities. A significant breakthrough was the development of protocols for generating uniform polymeric spherulites and their precursors in solution. Although spherulites are common in bulk polymer materials and materials found in fields such as geology and biology, they have not been observed from block polymers in solution. We uncovered a novel CDSA mechanism in which defects in lamellar precursors act as a critical driver for constructing 3D architectures. To achieve intricate, bioinspired, and uniform 3D structures, further efforts will focus on enhancing structural control and integrating multifunctional properties.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusMetallacycles, derivatives of carbocyclic compounds wherein a metal atom replaces at least one carbon center, have been a constant powerhouse in organic synthesis. While metallacycles of main-group, transition, and actinide metals have been extensively studied, those incorporating rare-earth (RE) elements (Sc, Y, and lanthanides) have remained elusive primarily due to synthetic challenges. Nevertheless, the electropositive character of these elements and the resulting polarization of RE-C bonds, along with the intrinsic synergistic effects within metallacycles, endow RE metallacycles with unique properties and a rich, yet largely untapped, reaction chemistry. In this Account, we present the development and applications of five-membered RE metallacycles.Over the past decade, we have successfully synthesized a variety of five-membered all-carbon rare-earth metallacycles using two key synthetic strategies: (i) transmetalation, which has been employed to prepare RE metallacyclopentadienes and spiro-metallacyclopentadienes, which, featuring various ligand systems, provide distinct coordination environments around the RE center, significantly influencing their reactivity, and (ii) transmetalation and reduction, enabling the synthesis of RE spiro-metallacyclopentenes and 2-butene tetraanion (BTA)-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes. The reduction process proceeds via either self-disproportionation of metallacyclopentadienes or reduction by divalent RE centers or alkali metals. These metallacycles represent the first instances of such RE-containing metallacyclic ring structures.Our investigations into these metallacycles have uncovered unique reactivities and new reaction modes. The high intrinsic reactivity and multiple reactive sites of rare-earth metallacycles enable them not only to activate small molecules efficiently but also to exhibit distinct activation modes for some small molecules. For instance, reactions of RE metallacyclopentadienes with carbodiimides showcase diverse insertion/rearrangement chemistry, influenced by various factors such as number of equivalents of carbodiimide and the solvent choice. The RE metallacyclopentadiene-mediated [3 + 1] fragmentation of white phosphorus demonstrates an activation mode markedly different from that observed with main-group and transition metal analogs. Moreover, the discovery of cross-carbanion coupling at RE centers and RE-metal-mediated ring-opening metathesis of benzene introduces new reaction modes, demonstrating that, with rational design, RE metals can exhibit properties similar to or even surpassing those of transition metals. These reaction modes have further led to the development of applications for RE metallacycles in synthetic chemistry.Additionally, some novel properties of these rare-earth metallacycles have been uncovered, stemming from their unique geometric and electronic structures. Structural analysis and theoretical calculations have revealed the nonplanar aromaticity of BTA-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes, extending the concept of nonplanar aromaticity into the chemistry of carbon-RE metallacycles. Furthermore, benefiting from the redox capabilities of butadiene dianion and BTA ligands, the ligand-based redox chemistry of BTA-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes demonstrates diverse and efficient multielectron transfer processes, highlighting the potential of these metallacycles for redox chemistry.The studies of rare-earth metallacycles, encompassing their construction, characterization, properties, reactivity, and synthetic applications, have greatly enriched the field of f-block metallacycles. We hope that this Account will inspire further exploration into the synthesis of new organometallic reagents and metallacycle-mediated transformations, fueling continued progress in rare-earth chemistry.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn recent years, multicomponent self-assembly has emerged as a pivotal strategy in supramolecular chemistry, enabling the construction of artificial systems with enhanced functionalities that surpass those of individual molecular components. These assemblies have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and biomedical engineering. However, achieving precise control over the assembly process remains a significant challenge, as increased structural complexity often results in thermodynamic mixtures, limiting their practical applications. In this context, metal-coordination-driven multicomponent self-assembly has emerged as a promising strategy, as the moderate strength and good directionality of metal-ligand bonds ensure the formation of discrete supramolecular architectures with well-defined structures and geometries. Notably, the integration of pyridyl and carboxylate donors with cis-Pt(II) nodes offers an effective approach for constructing multicomponent metallacages. This method is particularly attractive due to its ability to enable precise heteroleptic assembly, along with the accessibility and tunability of the ligands, which impart desirable photophysical properties and potential anticancer activities.This Account provides a comprehensive overview of our work on the design, preparation, and functionalization of multicomponent metallacages via the heteroleptic assembly of pyridyl and carboxylate ligands with cis-Pt(II) nodes. By strategically tailoring the ligand structures and adjusting the number of coordination sites, we have successfully constructed multicomponent metallacages with diverse geometries, including tetragonal and hexagonal prisms, triple-cavity ladders, truncated octahedra, and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, etc. In particular, we highlight the use of functional pyridyl ligands, such as tetraphenylethylene, hexaphenylbenzene, perylene diimide, and porphyrin derivatives, to explore the applications of these metallacages. Tetraphenylethylene and hexaphenylbenzene derivatives are propeller-shaped molecules with aggregation-induced emission properties, enhancing the emission of the metallacages both in solution and the solid state. Perylene diimide derivatives, with their electron-deficient, planar conjugated structures, contribute to strong emission in solution, thereby improving the host-guest chemistry and luminescent properties of the metallacages. Porphyrin derivatives, owing to their planar structures and excellent photosensitivity, endow the metallacages with significant photocatalytic capabilities. Additionally, other ligands, such as phenanthroline and triazine derivatives, have been employed to impart antibacterial and SO2 adsorption properties, respectively, to the metallacages. Furthermore, metallacage-cross-linked supramolecular networks exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and superior processability, making them promising candidates for functional materials. At the conclusion of this Account, we address the challenges and future perspectives in the development of multicomponent metallacages. We believe that ongoing research in this field will significantly advance the understanding of metal-coordination chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and the development of functional supramolecular materials.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusUltraviolet (UV) light has traditionally been used to drive photochemical organic transformations, mainly due to the limited visible-light absorption of most organic molecules. However, the high energy associated with UV light often causes undesirable side reactions. In the late 2000s, MacMillan, Yoon, and Stephenson pioneered the use of visible light in conjunction with photocatalysts (PCs) to initiate organic transformations. This innovative approach overcame the limitations of UV light by utilizing visible-light-absorbing PCs in their photoexcited states for electron or energy transfer, generating reactive radical species and promoting the photoreactions. Furthermore, while the photocatalysis has predominantly relied on transition-metal complexes, concerns over the potential toxicity, cost, and sustainability of these metals have driven the development of organic PCs. These organic PCs eliminate the need for metal removal, offer structural diversity, and enable tuning of their properties, thus paving the way for the creation of a tailored library of PCs.In recent decades, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel organic PCs with diverse scaffolds, with a notable example being the work of Zhang et al. in 2016. They demonstrated that cyanoarene analogues, originally developed by Adachi et al. for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in organic light-emitting diodes, could function effectively as PCs. Building on these insights, we developed a PC design platform featuring TADF compounds with twisted donor-acceptor structures, which paved the way for new PC discoveries. We showcased these PCs' ability (i) to generate long-lived lowest triplet excited (T1) states and (ii) to tune redox potentials by independently modifying donor and acceptor moieties. Through this platform, we discovered PCs with varying redox potentials and the capability to effectively populate T1 states, establishing structure-property relationships within our PC library and creating PC selection criteria for targeted reactions. Specifically, we tailored PCs for highly efficient reversible-deactivation radical polymerizations, including organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization, photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, and atom transfer radical polymerization with dual photoredox/copper catalysis as well as rapid free radical polymerizations. These advancements have also facilitated the development of functionalized, visible-light-cured adhesives for advanced display technologies. Furthermore, we investigated the origins of the exceptional catalytic performance of these PCs through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including electrochemical and photophysical measurements, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetics simulations. Specifically, we studied the formation and degradation of key PC intermediates in photocatalytic dehalogenations of alkyl and aryl halides. Our findings revealed a distinctive photodegradation pattern in the cyanoarene-based PCs, which significantly impact their catalytic efficiency in the reaction. Additionally, this discovery led us to introduce a concept of beneficial PC degradation for the first time.Over the past decades, organic photocatalysis based on the T1 state has become central to polymerization and organic synthesis. Utilizing our PC design platform, we have developed novel PCs and catalytic systems that enhance the overall efficiency of various organic transformations. In this overview of our contributions to visible-light-driven organic photocatalysis, we highlight the role of the T1 state in broadening applications through mechanistic analysis, enabling more sustainable transformations.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe challenge of optimizing decentralized water, wastewater, and reuse treatment systems calls for innovative, efficient technologies. One advancement involves surface-modified side-emitting optical fibers (SEOFs), which enhance biochemical and chemical light-driven reactions. SEOFs are thin glass or polymeric optical fibers with functionalized surfaces that can be used individually or bundled together. They can be attached to various light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers, which launch ultraviolet (UV) or visible light into the fibers. This light is then emitted along the fiber's surface, creating irradiance similar to a glow stick. The resulting SEOFs uniquely deliver light energy to complex environments while maximizing photon utilization and minimizing energy loss, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in photolysis and photocatalysis systems. SEOFs generate and leverage refracted light and evanescent waves to achieve continuous irradiation of their cladding, wherein photocatalysts are embedded. This method contrasts with traditional slurry-based systems, where light energy is often scattered or absorbed before reaching the reaction sites. Such scattering typically reduces quantum yields and reaction kinetics. In contrast, SEOFs create a controlled light delivery system that enhances reaction efficiency and adaptability to diverse applications.Important chemical and physical concepts are explored when scaling up SEOFs for three potential engineered applications. The selection of polymer materials and nanoparticle compositions is crucial for optimizing SEOFs as waveguides for visible to UV-C wavelengths and for embedding surface-accessible photocatalysts within porous polymer coatings on SEOF surfaces. Additionally, understanding how light propagates within SEOFs and emits along their exterior surface and length is essential for influencing the quantum yields of chemical products and enhancing biochemical sensitivity to low UV-C exposure. UV-C SEOFs are employed for germicidal disinfection, inactivating biofilms and pathogens in water systems. By overcoming UV light attenuation issues in traditional methods, SEOFs facilitate uniform distribution of UV-C energy, disrupting biofilm formation at early stages. SEOFs enhance UV-A and visible-light photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Embedding photocatalysts in porous polymer cladding enables simultaneous improvements in reaction kinetics and quantum yields. SEOFs enable decentralized light-driven production of clean energy resources such as hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, and formic acid, offering sustainable alternatives for off-grid systems.The design principles of SEOFs emphasize scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. Recent innovations in polymer chemistry, nanoparticle coatings, and surface roughness engineering have further optimized light delivery and side-emission. Tailoring the refractive index and nanoparticle distribution on fiber surfaces ensures precise evanescent wave propagation, enhancing photocatalytic performance. These advancements, coupled with scalable fabrication techniques, have positioned SEOFs as promising platforms for broad photochemical applications.By summarizing recent advances and identifying future needs, this Account positions SEOFs as a transformative approach to light-driven reactions, merging cutting-edge materials science with sustainable water treatment and energy production goals. This emerging technology offers immense potential to reshape photochemical processes for decentralized applications. Despite significant progress, challenges remain. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst loading, improving uniformity in side emissions, and enhancing polymer durability for long-term operational stability. Additionally, scaling SEOF configurations to multifiber bundles and integrating them into decentralized water systems will be critical for broader adoption.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusEnantioselective catalysts that exhibit broad generality are disruptive innovators in contemporary synthesis and are considered to be \"privileged\" on account of their expansive reactivity/selectivity profiles. Operating in the ground state, these species simultaneously regulate reactivity and orchestrate the translation of chiral information with exquisite efficiency: achieving parity in higher-energy (excited-state) scenarios remains a frontier in contemporary catalysis. Advancing this field will require new structure-activation guidelines to be delineated that reflect the energetic realities of achieving chiral induction in non-ground-state environments, thereby expediting the discovery of privileged photocatalysts. Earth-abundant aluminum-salen (Al-salen) complexes, which have a venerable history in ground-state enantioselective catalysis, show great promise in reconciling this disparity on account of their well-defined photophysical properties. In this Account, the potential of these catalysts in engaging various substrates via discrete activation modes to furnish optically enriched products with high levels of reliability is discussed. The deployment of commercial Al-salen complexes in the single electron transfer (SET)-enabled deracemization of cyclopropyl ketones is an exemplar. Irradiation of a commercial Al-salen complex augments the function of the catalyst to enable efficient deracemization (up to 98:2 e.r.), thereby eliminating the need for directing units. In stark contrast to conventional deracemization approaches that are predicated on C(sp3)-H deprotonation/reprotonation sequences, the transformation is characterized by a key C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond cleavage/cyclization process. Subsequent downstream manipulations of the enantioenriched products demonstrate the synthetic utility of the methodology. To illustrate mechanistic diversity using the same Al-salen complex, an enantioselective photocyclization under the auspices of energy transfer (EnT) catalysis is described. The photocyclization of acrylanilides under operationally simple conditions facilitates access to a diverse group of heterocyclic products (up to quantitative yield and 96:4 e.r.) using an Al-salen as the sole chiral operator. Collectively, these mechanistically distinct scenarios illustrate that light activation is a powerful strategy to augment the reactivity arsenal of a ubiquitous small molecule catalyst that is considered to be privileged in the ground state. The mechanistic foundations of reaction development are surveyed (combined experimental and computational approach), together with a perspective on the impact of this enabling technology in chiral functional molecule discovery. This Account serves to emphasize the synthetic utility of leveraging photochemical activation to mitigate intrinsic constraints of processes that might be considered to be thermochemically challenging.",

Among them, lanthanide-containing clusters (LCCs) are particularly notable for their aesthetically pleasing architectures and intriguing properties. Achieving precise synthesis and accurate structural characterization of these clusters is crucial for unlocking their potential applications. Mass spectrometry (MS), particularly electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), has proven to be a powerful tool, providing exceptional sensitivity and clarity in revealing the formation mechanisms and structural details of metal clusters. In this Account, we explore the synthesis, characterization, and assembly mechanisms of LCCs utilizing ESI-MS. We begin by tracing the historical development of LCCs, emphasizing the critical role of single-crystal X-ray diffraction in structural confirmation and the challenges associated with it. We then discuss the application of ESI-MS in characterizing LCCs, highlighting how this technique can monitor the formation processes of LCCs and determine their molecular weights and charge states. We introduce the mass difference fingerprint of isomorphism (MDFI) method, which can facilitate rapid analysis of LCCs' mass spectrometry data. Furthermore, we discuss the state of LCCs in solution and the challenges in their characterization. By utilizing ESI-MS, we enhance the understanding of the assembly mechanisms of LCCs and propose new strategies for designing and synthesizing new LCCs with tailored structures and functions. Looking forward, the ESI-MS method will play increasingly significant roles in LCC research.

    "abstract": "ConspectusCarbenes, as highly reactive intermediates, have emerged as pivotal tools in organic synthesis, catalysis, and materials science due to their versatile reactivity and broad applicability. Among the diverse classes of carbenes, donor-acceptor carbenes (DACs) have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and exceptional reaction selectivity. The distinctive reactivity of DACs arises from the synergistic electronic interplay between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups attached to the carbene center, enabling a wide array of transformations. These attributes have established DACs as indispensable building blocks for constructing complex molecular architectures and achieving precise control over chemical transformation.This Account highlights our recent advancements in the development of fluoroalkylacylsilanes as novel precursors for DACs. Under photocatalytic conditions, these fluoroalkylacylsilanes generate fluoroalkyl siloxycarbenes via a radical Brook rearrangement. The fluoroalkyl group, known for its strong electron-withdrawing properties, imparts electrophilic characteristics, while the siloxyl group stabilizes the carbene center. Together, these functionalities render fluoroalkylacylsilanes ideal candidates for the generation of DACs, providing a versatile platform for a wide range of novel transformations, including cycloadditions, bond insertions, and the construction of new molecular structures.First, we developed a visible-light-induced, organocatalyzed [2 + 1] cyclization of alkynes and trifluoroacetylsilanes, leading to the synthesis of cyclopropenols. Mechanistic studies provided compelling evidence for the involvement of triplet carbene intermediates in this reaction, demonstrating the utility of DACs in the synthesis of highly functionalized cyclic compounds. Second, we explored cyclopropanation reactions and elucidated the diastereoselective transfer of trifluoroacetylsilane-derived DACs to alkenes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed key insights into the origins of the observed diastereoselectivity, offering a molecular-level understanding of the stereochemical outcomes. Additionally, we extended the scope of our reactions to include organoboronic esters, enabling the divergent synthesis of fluoroalkyl ketones. By modulating the reactivity of the in situ-generated organoboronate complexes─formed through the reaction of DACs with organoboronic esters─we achieved selective synthesis of both fluorine-maintaining and defluorinated ketones. This transition-metal-free approach is operationally simple and compatible with a broad range of substrates, including aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl boronic esters. Beyond cyclization and C-B bond functionalization, we applied our novel DACs to C(sp2)-H functionalization reactions of 1,3-azoles. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the success of these reactions stems from the dual role of trifluoroacetylsilanes under photocatalytic conditions: they not only generate carbenes that participate in cyclopropanation but also produce biradicals that facilitate the ring-opening aromatization of the in situ-generated fused cyclopropanes.We anticipate that our work on fluoroalkylacylsilanes as ambiphilic donor-acceptor carbene precursors will lay the groundwork for further advancements in the use of functionalized acylsilanes in carbene chemistry. These developments are expected to inspire new strategies for the design of DACs and expand the utility of silanes in complex synthetic transformations, opening new avenues for the construction of intricate molecular architectures.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSolution-processable conjugated polymers are typically composed of two distinct structural components: rigid conjugated backbones and flexible side chains, each with unique roles and properties. The conjugated backbone forms the core framework of the polymer and is directly responsible for its optoelectronic properties, such as light absorption, emission, and charge transport. Meanwhile, the conjugated backbone can undergo chemical doping, where molecular dopants introduce charge carriers to modulate the carrier density and electrical conductivity. Therefore, the conjugated backbone is the critical determinant of the resulting optoelectronic performance. However, on the other hand, the flexible side chains, originally introduced to improve solution processability, were long considered chemically inert to the doping reaction. Recent advances have shown that the role of side chains is more than just improving solubility, demonstrating the significant impact of side chains on the packing of the conjugated backbone, film morphology, and electronic properties of conjugated polymers. Side chain engineering has become an essential design strategy for creating high-performance conjugated polymers in various applications.In this Account, we aim to emphasize the importance of side chain engineering toward controllable chemical doping of conjugated polymers, where side chain engineering allows us to tune the molecular packing, doping efficiency, and film morphology, thereby enhancing charge transport and optoelectronic performance. Specifically, the length, branching structures, and functional groups of the side chains can be systematically varied to control the solubility, miscibility, and interactions of conjugated polymers with dopants. For example, longer or branched side chains can improve solubility but may disrupt the π-π stacking between the conjugated backbones, thereby reducing the charge transport efficiency of the polymer. Shorter or linear side chains may enhance backbone packing and electronic coupling, though at the expense of reduced solubility. The impact of side chains on the doping process is particularly noteworthy. Although side chains are chemically inert to doping reactions, their design influences all three critical steps of the doping process: mixing, ionization, and carrierization. Side chains affect the spatial distribution of dopants during mixing, modulate the local environment to facilitate charge transfer during ionization, and influence the dissociation of ion pairs into free charge carriers during carrier generation. Functional side chains with polar groups, for example, can enhance dopant-polymer compatibility, while those with functional groups can modulate the dielectric environment to weaken ion pairing and promote free carrier generation. The interplay between side chains and the conjugated backbone is critical to achieving optimal optoelectronic performance in applications such as organic photovoltaics, field-effect transistors, and thermoelectrics. Rational side chain engineering provides a powerful tool to address these challenges in doping, morphology control, and charge transport, bringing more opportunities to design advanced conjugated polymers and chemical dopants tailored to specific applications.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusDiazocarbonyl compounds have become essential tools in organic synthesis, due to their ability to in situ generate reactive carbenes and be inserted in a variety of otherwise stable bonds, such as C-H, C-C, H-O, and so on. However, a soluble metal salt or complex catalyst is generally required to selectively activate and couple the carbene, and the metals employed so far are expensive (Rh, Au, Ag, Cu) and often unrecoverable. It is noteworthy that the price of ligands can make a cheaper metal catalyst (i.e., Cu) as expensive as other ligand-free noble metal catalysts. In the realm of modern sustainable chemistry, most of these methodologies are now unacceptable and must be adapted, and simple strategies for that include carbene photoactivation and the use of recoverable solid catalysts. Unfortunately, despite research in the field of carbene insertion reactions that has extended now for more than 50 years, examples with solid catalysts are still minor, and efficient solid catalysts have only been reported in the last two decades.This Account shows the journey faced by our group in the last eight years to find solid catalysts for challenging carbene insertion reactions, employing diazocarbonyl compounds as carbene precursors. We will contextualize our results with those of previous solid catalysts. The discovery in 2017 that a quasi-linear Pd4 cluster stabilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) was able to catalyze the Büchner and other carbene insertion reactions, spurred the design of supported metal clusters as catalysts for a variety of carbene insertion reactions. The Pd4-MOF could be reused 20 times in batch and implemented in a flow process. Following this, other catalytic solids, including Au and Ag as metals, not only in the same MOF but also on solid oxides and zeolites as supports, showed good activity for carbene insertion reactions and were also recoverable and reusable.Our journey temporarily finishes in 2024 when \"blank\" experiments with a dealuminated zeolite surprisingly revealed that this simple solid acid, without any metal, easily activates the diazocarbonyl compound and catalyzes a variety of carbene insertion reactions, thus providing a cheap, commercially available, and reusable solid catalyst for these challenging reactions. Overall, rapid progress in solid-catalyzed diazocarbonyl compound activation, carbene formation, and insertion reactions has been achieved during these years, moving from expensive and difficult to prepare solid catalysts based on supported metal clusters to simple acid zeolites, pointing to confined Brønsted acids as the catalysts to study in the near future.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe heating of matter upon interacting with light is a fundamental process ubiquitous in the natural world. With the rise of nanotechnology over the past decades, a variety of nanomaterials capable of converting light into heat have been discovered and their physicochemical properties investigated. Perhaps the most exotic is the photothermal heating of metallic nanocrystals via surface plasmons. Here an incoming electromagnetic wave triggers the oscillation of the nanoparticle's electron cloud. When in resonance, this generates an enormous increase to the absorption coefficient, enabling more energy to dissipate as heat. The plasmonic phenomenon has an incredibly diverse range of functions, from the vibrant coloration of medieval stained-glass windows to the localization and enhancement of light at the nanoscale level. Plasmonic heating or thermoplasmonics is a relatively new addition that has gained popularity mainly through applications in therapeutics and biotechnology. With this Account, we aim to put a spotlight on the use of thermoplasmonics to drive chemical synthesis, a rapidly expanding area of research with immense potential.Throughout the long tradition of chemical synthesis, chemists have rarely deviated from the typical oven or hot plate to set and maintain a homogeneous temperature within the reaction vessel. In contrast, the use of thermoplasmonic nanomaterials can introduce heterogeneity to the heating profile of a reaction by forming steep temperature gradients near the surface of nanoparticles. Additionally, photothermal conversion enables heat activated processes to benefit from the advantages of light initiation, e.g., contactless activation and spatial control. Thus, thermoplasmonics offers an attractive alternative to the long-standing norm.Several early studies demonstrated the power of this method, taking advantage of the localized heating to carry out reactions with minimal change to the bulk temperature of the surrounding medium. However, tapping into this potential can be very challenging as colloidal solutions tend to aggregate even with small changes to the environment. Different strategies have been utilized to overcome this obstacle, for example embedding particles into glass or other heterogeneous substrates. Our group has experimented with coating gold nanostructures with a silica shell. This ensures the structural and colloidal stability that is critical for thermoplasmonic chemistry. Recently, we applied this methodology to advance olefin metathesis, the synthesis of iron oxide (IO), palladium (Pd) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles, and the formation of various metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition, highly stable hybrid materials could be isolated as composites of plasmonic particles with polymers, MOFs, and other nanostructures. The large variety of reaction conditions and the different precursors, additives, and catalysts that our method proved to be compatible with highlight the versatility that silica encapsulation provides. The unique properties of plasmonic heating coupled with the added stability can open a wide range of opportunities for more efficient reactions and altogether new reactivity along with the formation of novel composite materials.",

Specifically, M-H complexes are active intermediates that catalyze hydrogen-transfer reactions, leading to efficient hydrogenation and hydrofunctionalization of C═C/C═X (X = O or N) bonds in unsaturated organic substrates for the formation of new carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and carbon-heteroatom bonds.Our research group has long studied M-H transformation mechanisms, with significant advancements over the past decade. For this Account, we have drawn on our extensive expertise to investigate the mechanisms governing numerous M-H transformation-driven reactions, including the hydrogenation of inert C═X bonds in unsaturated compounds, the hydrofunctionalization of C═C/C═X bonds, dehydrogenative coupling, and C-H functionalizations. On the basis of these mechanistic investigations, we developed a series of representative M-H transformation models, which offer robust theoretical guidance for modulating the reactivity and selectivity of M-H complexes in hydrogenation and hydrofunctionalization.Our Account begins with the structures and properties of M-H complexes, which lead to homolytic and heterolytic cleavage in reactions with different conditions, showcasing the remarkable versatility of metal hydride reactivity. Based on these principles, three transformation modes are discussed. First, hydride transfer of low-oxidation-state M-H complexes is chiefly engaged because the hydrogen atom attached to the metal has a high electron density and is strongly nucleophilic. In this case, a hydrogen atom serves as a hydride to transfer from the metal center to the electropositive center of the substrate through the following pathways: (a) insertion of an unsaturated bond into the M-H bond; (b) direct hydride transfer from the metal center to the electrophilic site of an unsaturated bond; (c) σ-bond metathesis; and (d) oxidative hydrogen migration. Reductive elimination might also occur when the oxidation state of the metal center increases and the metal center becomes electron-deficient. This usually regenerates the low-oxidation-state catalytic species while producing C/X'-H bonds. Notably, metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) is an advanced approach to radical-type hydrofunctionalizations. MHAT is usually induced by (a) a one-electron redox process enabled by a paramagnetic metal or (b) low M-H bond dissociation energy (BDE) values. Two possible types of MHAT (i.e., spontaneous and passive), which lead to different regioselectivities, are proposed. This article provides a detailed account of the strategies and mechanisms related to the reactivity and selectivity of M-H bond transformations, thus offering valuable guidance for the rational design of novel M-H complexes and reaction systems.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe ability to synthesize nanoarchitected materials with tunable geometries provides a means to control their functional properties, with applications in biological, environmental, and energy fields. To this end, various bottom-up and top-down synthesis processes have been developed. However, many of these processes require prepatterning or etching steps, making them challenging to scale-up to complex, nonplanar substrates. Furthermore, the ability to integrate nanomaterials into hierarchical arrays with precise control of feature spacing and orientation remains a challenge.One approach to overcome these patterning challenges is the use of surface modification layers to guide the resulting geometry of nanomaterial architectures grown from the substrate. A powerful strategy to accomplish this is what we will refer to as \"surface-directed assembly,\" where the resulting geometric parameters (feature size, shape, orientation) are predetermined by the initial surface layer. In particular, the use of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to form a surface layer, followed by solution-based growth processes, has the ability to synthesize architected structures with tunable geometries on complex, nonplanar surfaces.Over the past decade, we have reported a series of studies where surface-directed assembly is used to synthesize ZnO nanowires (NWs) on top of a variety of substrates. In this case, a thin film of ZnO is deposited onto the substrate using ALD, which can guide the NW diameter, spacing, and angular orientation with respect to the substrate by controlling epitaxial relationships. Furthermore, we have shown that by depositing a submonolayer overcoat of a secondary material (e.g., amorphous TiO2), nucleation sites are partially blocked, which can further tune the spacing between nanowires while minimizing changes to their other geometric properties. This approach can be used to generate multilevel hierarchical structures, such as hyperbranched NW arrays with tunable control of each level of hierarchy using ALD. Finally, we have demonstrated that the tunable control of geometric parameters can be scaled-up to curved, nonplanar substrates. This highlights the power of ALD to conformally and uniformly deposit the seed layers on complex substrates with subnanometer precision.To complement these seeded hydrothermal approaches, we expanded this strategy to include conversion chemistry of the initial ALD seed layers. For example, by replacing ZnO with Al2O3 as the seed layer without changing the hydrothermal growth conditions, Al-Zn layered-double hydroxide nanosheets can be formed instead of nanowires. In another example of conversion chemistry, a solution anion-exchange process was used to incorporate sulfur into ALD metal oxide films. In both of these conversion processes, the properties of the initial ALD film enabled tuning of the resulting nanostructure geometry.In this Account, we describe the use of ALD to guide the growth of diverse nanomaterial systems, with tunable control over their geometry and composition. We further show how these approaches can be used to tune functional properties for a range of applications, including superomniphobic surfaces, antibiofouling coatings, and photocatalysis. We conclude with an outlook on how the combination of ALD and solution synthesis can enable future directions in scalable nanomanufacturing to overcome the limitations of traditional top-down and bottom-up approaches.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusEngineering sensing interfaces with functional nanomaterials have aroused great interest in constructing novel analytical platforms. The good catalytic abilities and physicochemical properties allow functional nanomaterials to perform catalytic signal transductions and synergistically amplify biorecognition events for efficient target analysis. However, further boosting their catalytic performances poses grand challenges in achieving more sensitive and selective sample assays. Besides, nanomaterials with abundant atomic compositions and complex structural characteristics bring about more difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanism of signal amplification. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs), as an emerging class of heterogeneous catalysts, feature support-stabilized isolated metal catalytic sites, showing maximum metal utilization and a strong metal-support interfacial interaction. These unique structural characteristics are akin to those of homogeneous catalysts, which have well-defined coordination structures between metal sites with synthetic or biological ligands. By integrating the advantages of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, ADMCs present superior catalytic activity and specificity relative to the nanoparticles formed by the nonuniform aggregation of active sites. ADMC-enabled sensing platforms have been demonstrated to realize advanced applications in various fields. Notably, the easily tunable coordination structures of ADMCs bring more opportunities to improve their catalytic performance, further moving toward efficient signal transduction ability. Besides, by leveraging their inherent physicochemical properties and various detection strategies, ADMC-enabled sensing interfaces not only achieve enhanced signal transductions but also show diversified output models. Such superior functions allow ADMC-enabled sensing platforms to access the goal of high-performance detection of trace targets and making significant progress in analytical chemistry.In this Account, we provide an overview of recent progress in atomically dispersed metal-involved interfaces in analytical chemistry. The engineering strategies focused on regulating metal centers, integrating multisite synergy, and tuning charge transport pathways are discussed to boost the catalytic activity and specificity of ADMCs as well as expand their multifunctionality. Combined with various transduction models, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, and photoelectrochemistry, ADMC-based sensors achieve efficient detection of diverse analytes. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms of signal transduction are highlighted. Finally, the perspective and challenges of the ADMC-enabled interface for analytical chemistry are further proposed. We hope that this Account will afford significant inspiration toward the design of ADMCs and the decoding of the improved sensing interfaces.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe homolytic cleavage of C-C bonds adjacent to functional groups has recently become a popular strategy for restructuring the skeletons of complex organic molecules. In contrast to the traditional reactivity profiles of polar bond disconnections, homolytic scission furnishes carbon-centered free radicals primed for controlled termination with a diverse range of radicophiles. Beyond standard radical capture, transition-metal catalysis facilitates sophisticated C-C and C-heteroatom bond-forming reactions. Intensive efforts have been focused over many years into the cleavage of the neighboring C-C bonds of carboxylic acids and alcohols. Despite the ubiquity of alkenes and ketones in natural products, feedstock chemicals, and common synthetic intermediates, much less attention has been paid to exploiting their potential in diversifying chiral pool materials, such as terpenes and terpenoids. Defunctionalization in this manner is a powerful approach for synthesizing high-value chemicals and advanced synthetic intermediates because of the possibility to reconstruct and further decorate chirality-bearing carbon skeletons. Motivated by synthetic necessity, since 2018 our group has focused on developing ozonolysis-based dealkenylative molecular diversification, and we expanded into deacylation in 2025. In this Account, we chronicle our initial motivation, describe the historical background, and summarize our research into dealkenylative and deacylative synthesis. Our dealkenylative approach capitalizes on the ozonolysis of alkenes in MeOH to generate α-methoxyhydroperoxides primed for a reaction with reducing agents. Their reduction through single electron transfer, mediated by a transition metal, leads to the formation of an alkoxyl radical that undergoes rapid β-scission, furnishing both a carbon-centered free radical and an ester group derived from the acetal carbon atom. The produced free radical can be strategically terminated by radicophiles, thereby delivering remodeled chiral molecules. Using this concept, we have developed hydrodealkenylation (through hydrogen atom transfer from benzenethiol), dealkenylative thiylation (through thiyl group transfer from diaryl disulfides), alkenylation (through addition/elimination with nitrostyrenes), and oxodealkenylation (through treatment with TEMPO followed by oxidation). Furthermore, kinetic analysis has enabled the development of a catalytic FeII/vitamin C system for dealkenylative alkynylation and halodealkenylation. Synergizing ozonolysis and copper catalysis has recently enabled aminodealkenylation through net-redox-neutral C-C cleavage followed by C-N bond formation. Although the high oxidation potential of ozone relative to organic compounds makes alkene-to-peroxide conversion possible, it also limits the applicability of dealkenylative techniques for substrates featuring ozone-sensitive functional groups. We recently overcame this constraint by first applying Isayama-Mukayiama peroxidation to olefins and then using a novel catalytic system─catalytic FeIII and PhSH with stoichiometric γ-terpinene─for ozone-free hydrodealkenylation. Beyond alkenes, we have developed a straightforward methodology for the homolytic deacylative cleavage of ketones as well, including cycloalkanones. This process is applicable in total syntheses and in the late-stage modifications of complex ketone-containing natural products.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusPhotoinduced energy and electron transfer processes offer a convenient way to convert light energy into electrical or chemical energy. These processes remain the basis of operation of thin film solar cells, light emitting and optoelectronic devices, and solar fuel generation. In many of these applications, semiconductor nanocrystals that absorb in the visible and near-infrared region are the building blocks that harvest photons and initiate energy or electron transfer to surface-bound chromophores. Such multifunctional aspects make it challenging to steer the energy transfer pathway selectively. Proper selection of the semiconductor nanocrystal donor requires consideration of the nanocrystal bandgap, along with the alignment of valence and conduction band energies relative to that of the acceptor, in order to achieve desired output of energy or electron transfer.In this Account, we focus on key aspects of managing energy flow from excited semiconductor nanocrystals to surface-bound chromophores. The singlet and triplet characteristics of the semiconductor nanoparticle enable tuning of energy transfer pathways through bandgap engineering. In addition to the alignment of energy levels between the semiconductor donor and the singlet/triplet energy levels of the acceptor dye, other parameters such as spectral overlap, surface binding through functional groups, and rate of competing energy transfer pathways all play integral roles in directing energy transfer. For example, in a prototypical halide perovskite nanocrystal-rhodamine dye assembly, singlet energy transfer is observed when the donor is a high-bandgap semiconductor (e.g., CsPbBr3, Eg= 2.47 eV). However, when the donor is a low-bandgap semiconductor (e.g., CsPbI3, Eg = 1.87 eV), one observes only triplet energy transfer. Tuning of the donor bandgap with mixed halide perovskites (e.g., CsPb(BrxI1-x)3) allows for populations of both singlet and triplet excited states of the acceptor dye. Additionally, triplet characteristics of the donor semiconductor nanocrystal can be further enhanced through Mn doping which places low-energy triplet-active states within the nanocrystal donor.The ability to steer energy transfer pathways in a semiconductor nanocrystal-dye assembly finds its use in the design of semiconductor-multichromophoric films. Such hybrid films can down-shift or up-convert incident photons and deliver emission at desired wavelengths. By selecting high energy donor (e.g., CsPbBr3) one can down-shift the incident photons through energy transfer cascade, as in the case of the CsPbBr3-rubrene-tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) system to populate singlet excited DBP (perylene derivative). On the other hand, when the donor energy is low as in the case of CsPbI3-rubrene-DBP, one can populate singlet DBP via triplet-triplet annihilation. Thus, by steering energy transfer pathways, it is possible to manage the photon flow and obtain desired emission output. Fundamental understanding of excited state processes responsible for energy transfer will assist in designing light harvesting assemblies that can manage photon delivery effectively in display devices and other optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusMelanin, specifically eumelanin, is a brownish-black pigment abundant in nature. It is a heterogeneous biopolymer known most commonly for its spectacular photoprotection property in humans, animals, and plants. Numerous other properties of eumelanin have recently been identified, including radical scavenging, thermal regulation, charge transport, etc. While the presence and significance of melanin have long been accepted, its exact chemical makeup remains unclear. Melanin has an inherent diversity of structure and complexity, making understanding many of its properties challenging. Therefore, there are large gaps in our understanding of the structure-property relationship in melanin. On the other hand, due to its diverse properties and biocompatibility, there is significant interest in engineering such biomimetic devices and materials with targeted properties utilizing melanin-like scaffolds. Furthermore, recent efforts toward understanding the molecular origin of its properties are also based on synthetic melanin analogs. For all these reasons, understanding the structure of melanin and its structure-property relationship remains pivotal to much of the progress in this direction.Our research has revolved around providing new insights into the structure of melanin and its structure-function correlations for properties such as absorption spectra, electron transport, and photoprotection. We have used tools based on a combination of computational chemistry and machine learning to answer these questions. Many of these methods and protocols developed in the group for solving this problem can be utilized for other problems of similar complexity.The difficulties in elucidating these aspects of melanin chemistry lie in its inherent structural and chemical diversity. It is a biopolymer with heterogeneity in monomeric units, oxidation states, polymerization site, and significant conformational degrees of freedom. Many of the attractive properties of melanin are a direct consequence of this diversity. One such property is its broadband absorption spectra, which allow it to absorb light across the UV-visible range and, therefore, function as a photoprotective agent against solar radiation. The melanin absorption spectra are unusual in their monotonic and featureless form. It is now well-accepted that both structural and chemical heterogeneity are responsible for these unusual spectra. Therefore, the problem of isolating specific chromophores responsible for different parts of the spectra becomes a daunting task. While previous computational and experimental studies have shown that diversity is central to this property, i.e., the spectrum is an ensemble or average spectrum, they have not been able to identify specific structures that are responsible. Therefore, we have used machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts to identify patterns and reconstruct particular structures. We have shown, with the help of machine learning and computational chemistry, that data-driven approaches can identify specific structures or classes of structures that are important chromophores. This provides a significant direction in answering the questions about the structure-function correlation of melanin for its absorption spectra.For charge transport properties we have shown the importance of hydrogen bond networks and, therefore, the most successful structural motifs for efficient charge transport. Furthermore, with a bottom-up approach, we have also identified nonradiative pathways for the deactivation of photoactivated melanin.",

Consequently, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of enantiopure atropisomers has garnered considerable attention. A variety of synthetic strategies involving metal catalysis or organocatalysis have been developed. Among these elegant approaches, transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H activation has emerged as an atom- and step-economical strategy to streamline the construction of axially chiral compounds in recent years.In this Account, we discuss our efforts in the atroposelective synthesis of different types of axially chiral compounds, including biaryls, atropisomeric styrenes, and C-N atropisomers, via transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H activation strategies. To this end, we have developed several approaches, including the chiral transient directing group (cTDG) strategy using catalytic Pd(OAc)2 and tert-leucine (Tle), as well as catalytic enantioselective systems involving Pd(II)/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), Pd(II)/l-pyroglutamic acid (pGlu), Pd(0)/norbornene cooperative catalysis with a chiral biimidazoline (BiIM) ligand, and Co(II)/salicyloxazoline (Salox).At the outset, we successfully applied the cTDG strategy to access axially chiral biaryl aldehydes through Pd-catalyzed atroposelective C-H olefination, alkynylation, allylation, naphthylation, and alkylation. The efficacy of these methods has been demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of chiral aldehyde catalysts and natural products, such as TAN-1085, (+)-isochizandrin, and (+)-steganone. To facilitate the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers with diverse functionalities, we developed a novel Pd(II)/CPA catalytic system, which enables the preparation of various axially chiral quinolines, biaryl-2-amines, and atropisomeric biaryls bearing chalcogenoether units with high enantioselectivities. The Pd(II)/CPA system also allows for the synthesis of more challenging conjugated diene-based axially chiral styrenes.Nonbiaryl atropisomers, such as axially chiral styrenes and anilides, present synthetic challenges due to their conformational instability and higher degree of rotational freedom compared to their biaryl counterparts. We have addressed these challenges and achieved the highly efficient synthesis of atropisomeric styrenes and anilides using Pd(II)/pGlu and Pd(0)/norbornene/BiIM catalysis. In addition to palladium catalysis, cobalt(II)/Salox catalysis has also been developed for the construction of chiral biaryls, atropisomers with vicinal C-N and C-C stereogenic axes, remote distinct C-N diaxes, and chiral calix[4]arenes featuring both inherent and axial chirality. We anticipate that the enantioselective C-H activation strategy will find broad applications in the construction of synthetically useful axially chiral compounds.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe unique photon emission signatures of trivalent lanthanide cations (Ln3+, where Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb) enables multicolor emission from semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) either through doping multiple Ln3+ ions of distinct identities or in combination with other elements for the creation of next-generation light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, sensors, imaging probes, and other optoelectronic devices. Although advancements have been made in synthetic strategies to dope Ln3+ in semiconductor NPs, the dopant(s) selection criteria have hinged largely on trial-and-error. This combinatorial approach is often guided by treating NP-dopant(s) energy transfer dynamics through the lens of spectral overlap. Over the past decade, however, we have demonstrated that the spectral outcomes correlate better with the placement of Ln3+ energy levels with respect to the band edges of the semiconductor, and oxide, host.In this Account, we describe how the Ln3+ energy level alignments affect the dopant emission intensities and dictate interdopant energy transfer processes in semiconductor nanoparticle hosts. This Account begins with a concise primer on the emission characteristics of trivalent lanthanides, the challenges that are associated with realizing meaningful lanthanide luminescence, and how semiconductor nanoparticles can act as a host to sensitize lanthanide emission. We then describe a semiempirical approach that can be used to place the lanthanide ground and luminescent energy levels with respect to the band edges of the host semiconductor nanoparticle. The ability of this model to track and predict the lanthanide sensitization efficiency is illustrated for singly doped zinc sulfide (ZnS), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and cesium lead chloride (CsPbCl3) perovskite hosts. Next, we discuss how knowledge of energy level offsets can be used to select dopant(s) for tunable multicolor emission by identifying different charge trapping processes for semiconductors doped with single and multiple lanthanides and discussing their impact on sensitization outcomes. Following this discussion, the Account lists viable Ln3+ combinations in ZnS NPs based on the charge trapping model and shows the limitations of spectral overlap models in predicting viable Ln3+ dopant combinations. Feasible f-f and d-f codopant combinations based on charge trapping are presented for TiO2 and CsPbCl3 NPs. The intricacies of interdopant energy migration and spin considerations that dictate the dopant(s) sensitization efficiencies are made known. Finally, we use these considerations to predict NP-dopant(s) combinations that should exhibit concerted emissions from the blue to the near-infrared (NIR) region, thereby enabling the design of bespoke optoelectronic properties. The Account ends with some forward-looking thoughts, arguing for the need to develop better quantitative models in order to explore the Ln3+ sensitization mechanisms and presenting ideas for applications of doped semiconductor NPs in energy and health that would be aided by interdopant energy transfer dynamics.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusMass transport is fundamental to biological systems and industrial processes, governing chemical reactions, substance exchange, and energy conversion across various material scales. In biological systems, ion transport, such as proton migration through voltage-gated proton channels, regulates cellular potential, signaling, and metabolic balance. In industrial processes, transporting molecules through solid, liquid, or gas phases dictates reactant contact and diffusion rates, directly impacting reaction efficiency and conversion. Optimizing these processes necessitates the design of efficient interfaces or channels to enhance mass transport.Crystalline porous materials, particularly covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offer an excellent platform for investigating and optimizing mass transport. With ordered, pre-engineered nano- or subnanometer pores, COFs enable confined substance transport and garnered significant attention for energy conversion, catalysis, drug delivery, adsorption, and separation applications. Deeper investigations into the mass transport mechanism in COFs at the molecular level are crucial for advancing materials science, chemistry, and chemical engineering.Our group focuses on COFs to explore multisubstance cooperative transport mechanisms and structure-activity relationships for ions, water, and gases. We have expanded the linker chemistry of COFs by developing irreversible α-aminoketone-linked COFs and introducing the irreversible Suzuki coupling reaction into COF preparation. We proposed strategies such as side-chain-induced dipole-facilitated stacking and prenucleation and slow growth to achieve record large pore sizes and highly oriented nanochannels. We implemented exfoliation and an interwoven strategy to accelerate ion transport at complex interfaces, refined gas permeability in molecular sieve-based membranes through precise pore size engineering, and elucidated the effects of pore size and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity on water phase transition and diffusion. Building on these insights, we designed novel open framework ionomers to tailor the microenvironment of electrocatalytic interfaces and uncovered multiple substance transport mechanisms. The synergistically enhanced transport of ions, water, and gas across three-phase interfaces effectively modulates the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathway and significantly boosts the power density of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).In this Account, we summarize recent advances in COF-based ion and molecular transport, emphasizing nanochannel construction strategies, including linkage, pore size, orientation, and function gradient modulations. We discuss the functional design of COFs, correlations between pore structure and transport properties, and their applications in gas separation, energy storage, and catalysis. Finally, we outline current challenges and future opportunities in synthetic chemistry, mass transport mechanisms, and applications. By understanding mass transport phenomena from microscopic particles to macroscopic scales, this Account aims to provide molecular design strategies for optimizing multisubstance transport across three-phase interfaces, aligning mass transport with reaction processes and offering insights to enhance catalytic efficiency and energy conversion performance.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusDual-atom catalysts (DACs), featuring two catalytic sites in close proximity, have emerged as a new frontier in energy-related catalysis. Compared with single-atom catalysts (SACs), DACs have more space to optimize the catalytic performance by changing the dual-atom catalytic sites and their coordination environments. Through adjusting the compositions and coordination environments of the metal sites in DACs, it is possible to finely tune the electronic and geometric properties of active centers, and then the synergistic effects for facilitating substrates activation and intermediates stabilization can be strengthened or optimized, consequently tailoring diverse reaction pathways and achieving various challenging catalytic reactions. The most important yet challenging task in DACs studies is the precise synthesis of DACs, which is crucial to understand the relationship between the catalytic performance and structure at the atomic level. In most cases, DACs were synthesized via the pyrolysis of a mixture of metal salts and organic ligands, in which two metals are randomly distributed in DACs, and it was difficult to control the M···M distance (M = metal ion) and uniform dispersion of DACs. Hence, developing innovative strategies for the precise synthesis of DACs with definite structures and high-efficiency catalytic performance is urgently needed.In this Account, we tentatively summarize the strategies for the precise synthesis of DACs and their applications in activation and conversion of small molecules such as H2O, CO2, and so on. Focusing on the precise synthesis of DACs, three types of synthesis strategies have been put forward and systematically introduced. Based on the precise synthesis strategies, the applications of the resulting DACs with high purity in synergistically activating and converting small molecules have concurrently been discussed, including the cleavage of C-C bonds, activation and reduction of CO2 and H2O, and so on. Attempts have been made to explain why the catalytic performance of DACs for these functions is much higher than what SACs have achieved. Efforts have been made on revealing the influences of dual-metal site types, the separations between dual metals, their geometry configurations and coordination environments, as well as the ligand structures on the catalytic performance. Emphasis has been placed on the analysis of the structure-reactivity relationship and revealing the synergistic mechanism at the molecular level. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and future development of DACs have been put forward. We anticipate and believe that this Account will provide profound insights into the synthesis of structurally defined DACs and give new insights of synergistic catalytic effects in DACs.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusTotal synthesis has long been a proving ground for advancing chemical thought, pushing chemists to develop strategies that not only replicate nature's complexity but often surpass it. The pursuit of efficiency, practicality, and elegance continues to challenge and reshape the guiding principles of total synthesis. In recent years, skeletal editing has emerged as a powerful strategy for reconfiguring skeletal frameworks in ways that were previously difficult to imagine. Unlike conventional chemical synthesis approaches, which primarily rely on the logic of bond construction reactions and functional group manipulations, skeletal editing introduces elements that allow for atom insertion, deletion, and exchange and skeletal rearrangement/reorganization by harnessing the potential energy and reactivity of certain structural motifs and morphing them into new electronic and spatial configurations. The logic of modern skeletal editing has been fueling the development of new editing methods and advancing the fields of total synthesis, medicinal chemistry, materials science, and others.In this Account, we detail our program using skeletal editing-based retrosynthetic logic to facilitate natural product synthesis. We first highlight two one-carbon insertion editing strategies utilizing the Ciamician-Dennstedt rearrangement and the Büchner-Curtius-Schlotterbeck ring expansion to streamline the total syntheses of complanadine and phleghenrine Lycopodium alkaloids. We next present our synthesis of crinipellin and gibberellin diterpenes by leveraging the facile synthesis and intrinsic strain of cyclobutanes as precursors to challenging cyclopentanes via cut-and-insert editing (crinipellins) or C-C bond migratory ring expansion (GA18). Toward the end, we describe our early efforts in orchestrating structural rearrangement and functional group pairing reactions to access seven monoterpene indole alkaloids and highlight the divergent potential of skeletal editing. Each of the five examples follows a build-edit-decorate workflow, inspired by Schreiber's build-couple-pair in diversity-oriented synthesis. In the build stage, key scaffolds are efficiently assembled from starting materials with matched reactivity. The edit stage morphs these scaffolds to the desired but more challenging ones encoded by the target molecules, reminiscent of Corey's application of rearrangement transforms as a topological strategy. The decorate stage introduces additional functional groups and adjusts oxidation states to complete the total synthesis, similar to the oxidase phase of Baran's two-phase synthesis. The essence of skeletal editing-based retrosynthetic analysis is to identify latent structural relationships between the readily assembled key scaffolds constructed in the build stage and the desired ones encoded by the target molecules as well as proper editing methods to transform the former into the latter with precision. The build-edit-decorate approach parallels the dynamism of biosynthesis, enabling rapid building of complexity with great efficiency and step economy, as analyzed by the spacial scores (SPS) of each case. Drawing on these principles, chemists can adopt skeletal editing-based retrosynthetic logic by identifying latent intermediates and employing and developing strategic editing methods to overcome synthetic bottlenecks.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusChemists have a firm understanding of the concept of a functional group: a small molecular moiety that confers properties (reactivity, solubility, and chemical recognition) onto a larger scaffold. Analogously, a quantum functional group (QFG) would act as an isolated \"quantum handle\" that could attach onto an extended molecule and enable quantum state preparation and measurement (SPAM). However, the complexity associated with molecular chemistry is often at odds with the requirements of nonthermal state preparation. The rest of the molecule acts as a local bath that leads to dephasing and loss of quantum information upon excitation and relaxation. Yet, there exists an enormous chemical space of potential chemical bonding motifs to design isolated QFGs. The goal of this Account is to explore the underlying chemical design principles for the optimization of QFG performance.For typical state preparation, an applied field is used to put the qubit into a specific known state (via optical cycling and laser cooling), where it can be manipulated or entangled with other species. That same field (or another) can be used to read out or report on the qubit state at the end of the operation. For example, in trapped ions/neutral atoms, state preparation is accomplished by pumping a specific transition using a narrowband laser. From there, further operations can be performed on the qubit via selective RF or laser excitation, and the state can be read out via fluorescence. However, extending this paradigm to molecular systems is highly challenging: molecules have many more degrees of freedom that can couple to the absorbed or emitted field. Overcoming this requires greatly limiting the number of these \"off-diagonal\" decay pathways through the judicious selection of the QFG and vibronic engineering of the molecular substrate.Our work has demonstrated that alkaline-earth (I) alkoxides (MOR) may meet the necessary requirements for efficient SPAM. In particular, we capitalize on the -OM (M = Ca, Sr) motif, which acts as a quantum handle that has been attached to a variety of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The precise breakdown of the optical cycling property depends on familiar chemical concepts, including conjugation, conformer formation, electron-withdrawing abilities, and symmetry. In this Account, we review the recent efforts in the field to construct QFGs and codesign molecular scaffolds that can host them without destruction of their desired quantum properties. QFGs are explored as attachments to photoswitching scaffolds and mounted in pairs to larger hosts. A variety of physical phenomena relevant to the ability of these QFGs to function as qubits, from Fermi resonances to super radiance, have been explored. We thus began deriving the first set of rules for vibronic engineering toward the QFG functionality. Prospects toward increasing the number densities of these QFGs through molecular and material design are also presented.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusProton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is essential for a wide range of chemical and biological processes. Understanding the mechanism of PCET reactions is important for controlling and tuning these processes. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE), defined as the ratio of the rate constants for hydrogen and deuterium transfer, is used to probe PCET mechanisms experimentally but is often challenging to interpret. Herein, a theoretical framework is described for interpreting KIEs of concerted PCET reactions. The first step is to classify the reaction in terms of vibronic and electron-proton nonadiabaticities, which reflect the relative time scales of the electrons, protons, and environment. The second step is to select the appropriate rate constant expression based on this classification. The third step is to compute the input quantities with computational methods.Vibronically adiabatic PCET reactions occur on the electronic and vibrational ground state and can be described within the transition state theory framework. The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, which treats specified protons quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons, can be used to generate the electron-proton vibronic free energy surface for hydrogen and deuterium and to compute the corresponding free energy barriers. Such reactions typically exhibit moderate KIEs that arise from zero-point energy and shallow tunneling effects.Vibronically nonadiabatic PCET reactions involve excited electron-proton vibronic states and can be described with a golden rule formalism corresponding to nonadiabatic transitions between pairs of reactant and product vibronic states. Such reactions can exhibit KIEs ranging from unity, or even slightly less than unity, to more than 500. These KIEs can be explained in terms of multiple, competing reaction pathways corresponding to electron and proton tunneling between different pairs of vibronic states. The tunneling probability is determined by the vibronic coupling, which can be computed using a general expression but often is proportional to the overlap between the reactant and product proton vibrational wave functions. In this regime, the KIE is influenced by the vibronic couplings, the proton donor-acceptor equilibrium distance and motion, and contributions from excited vibronic states.Three illustrative examples of vibronically nonadiabatic PCET are discussed. The unusually large KIEs in soybean lipoxygenase of ∼80 for the wild-type enzyme and ∼700 for a double mutant are explained in terms of a large equilibrium proton donor-acceptor distance and nonoptimal orientation, leading to a small overlap between vibrational wave functions and therefore a large difference in hydrogen and deuterium tunneling probabilities. The KIEs for benzimidazole-phenol molecules ranging from unity to moderate are explained in terms of the dominance of different pairs of vibronic states with different vibrational wave function overlaps. The potential-dependent KIE observed for proton discharge from triethylammonium acid to a gold surface in acetonitrile is explained in terms of different pairs of vibronic states contributing for hydrogen and deuterium, with the reaction channels exhibiting different dependencies on the applied potential. These examples show that the KIE can vary widely, depending on which pairs of vibronic states dominate and their corresponding vibronic couplings. This work has broad implications for the interpretation of experimentally measured KIEs of PCET reactions.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusDiffusion underlies vital physicochemical and biological processes and provides a valuable window into molecular states and interactions. However, it remains a challenge to map molecular diffusion at subcellular and submicrometer scales. Whereas single-particle tracking of fluorescent molecules provides a path to quantify motion at the nanoscale, its typical pursuit of long trajectories limits wide-field mapping to the slow diffusion of bound molecules.Single-molecule displacement/diffusivity mapping (SMdM) rises to the challenge. Rather than following each fluorescent molecule longitudinally as it randomly visits potentially heterogeneous environments, SMdM flips the question to ask, for every location (e.g., a 100 × 100 nm2 spatial bin) in a wide field, how different single molecules of identical nature move locally. This location-centered strategy is naturally effective for spatial mapping of diffusivity. Moreover, by focusing on local motion, each molecule only needs to be detected for its transient displacement within a fixed short time window to achieve local statistics. This task is fulfilled for fast-diffusing molecules using a tandem excitation scheme in which a pair of closely timed stroboscopic excitation pulses are applied across two tandem frames, so that wide-field single-molecule images are recorded at a pulse-defined ≲1 ms separation unlimited by the camera frame rate. With fitting models robust against mismatched molecules and diffusion anisotropy, SMdM thus successfully achieves super-resolution D mapping for fluorescently labeled molecules of contrasting sizes and properties in diverse cellular and in vitro systems.For intracellular protein diffusion, SMdM uncovers nanoscale diffusion heterogeneities in the mammalian cytoplasm and nucleus and further elucidates their origins from the macromolecular crowding effects of cytoskeletal and chromatin ultrastructures, respectively, through correlated single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). Across diverse compartments of the mammalian cell, including the cytoplasm, the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, and the mitochondrial matrix, SMdM further unveils a striking charge effect, in which the diffusion of positively charged proteins is biasedly impeded. For cellular membranes, the integration of SMdM with fluorogenic probes enables diffusivity fine-mapping, which, in combination with spectrally resolved SMLM (SR-SMLM), elucidates nanoscale diffusional heterogeneities of different origins. For biomolecular condensates, another synergy of SMdM and SR-SMLM uncovers the gradual formation of diffusion-suppressed, hydrophobic amyloid nanoaggregates at the surface of FUS (fused in sarcoma) protein condensates during aging. Beyond spatial mapping, the mass accumulation of single-molecule displacements in SMdM further affords a valuable means to quantify D with exceptional precision. This advantage is harnessed to show no enhanced diffusion of enzymes in reactions, to uncover ubiquitous net charge-driven protein-protein interactions in solution, and to show with strategically manipulated cytoplasmic extracts that molecular interaction in the crowded cell is defined by an overwhelmingly negatively charged macromolecular environment with dense meshworks, echoing our parallel results in the mammalian cell.Together, by uniquely enabling super-resolution mapping and high-precision quantification of molecular diffusion across diverse systems, SMdM opens a new door to reveal fascinating spatiotemporal heterogeneities in living cells and beyond.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusTumor immunotherapy, as a new antitumor method to fight cancer by activating or enhancing the body's own immune system, has been extensively studied and applied in clinical practice. However, as an extremely complex system, tumor heterogeneity and complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) lead to poor immune response rate or secondary drug resistance. The advent of nanotechnology has ushered in a new era for immunotherapy. In particular, inorganic nanomaterials, with their unique physicochemical properties and excellent biocompatibility, are becoming an important tool for enhancing immunotherapy. Inorganic nanomaterials can be used as carriers for immune agents, improving drug delivery efficiency and thereby reducing systemic immunotoxicity and enhancing immune responses. Inorganic nanomaterials also trigger tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD), stimulate antitumor immune responses, and alleviate immunosuppressive TME by increasing oxygen levels, modulating metabolic pathways, and altering the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. The synergistic integration of inorganic nanomaterials with immunotherapy adeptly navigates around the constraints of conventional treatments, reducing side effects while concurrently augmenting therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we summarize our recent efforts in the design and synthesis of inorganic nanobiomaterials to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. These nanomaterials achieve the desired immune efficacy mainly through four strategies, including inducing ICD, developing tumor nanovaccines, activating pyroptosis, and regulating tumor metabolism, providing beneficial implications for tumor immunotherapy. For one thing, due to the deficiency of ICD effect in single therapy, we mainly developed nanocatalysts that integrate multiple therapeutic functions to play a catalytic role in TME, converting tumor substances or metabolites into therapeutic products in situ, and further enhancing ICD. For another, in order to solve the problems of low antigen loading and therapeutic efficiency of existing adjuvants, several novel multifunctional nanoadjuvants were prepared, which combine high antigen loading and multimode therapeutic function in one, and achieve efficient immune activation. Moreover, to attain strong inflammatory responses and immunogenicity, we engineer pyroptosis adjuvants that selectively induce tumor cell pyroptosis by enhancing intracellular oxidative stress or ion overload. Finally, to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment, we developed nanoplatforms that target tumor metabolism, altering the levels of nutrients and metabolites in tumor such as glucose, lactic acid, citric acid, and tryptophan to effectively alter the TME, thereby activating and enhancing the body's immune response. The implementation of these strategies not only improves the therapeutic effect but also reduces the side effects and provides valuable insights and references for the development of novel nanomaterials to assist immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn the last five years, interest in the precise modification of molecular cores─termed skeletal editing─has rapidly expanded in the Chemistry community. Beyond the intrinsic value of these transformations, skeletal editing also has value in the attention it brings to under-explored chemical challenges, whose solutions could transform the practice of Chemistry at large. In few contexts does this perspective ring as true as in the realm of polymers. Inspired by the revolutionary power of biologically derived machinery called CRISPR-Cas9 to edit nucleic acid polymers and, consequently, the genetic meaning encoded in them, we envisioned that skeletal editing of synthetic polymer backbones may also enable control over the structure and \"meaning\"─i.e., properties and function─of plastics. However, the idea of editing polymer backbones brings about numerous fundamental chemical questions that must be answered to make the vision a reality: for instance, how to constructively activate carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds that make up typical polymer backbones and how to do so in a site-selective manner? While many fundamental questions have begun to be answered by the small molecule community, they are yet to be applied to the realm of polymers, and such adaptation often begets new scientific challenges. Moreover, as we begin to tackle these questions, we must always consider how advances in skeletal editing of polymer backbones impact the broader contexts of applications and sustainability of plastics.In this Account, we summarize our efforts to advance the skeletal editing of polymer backbones, focusing on how such methods can affect each stage of the polymer lifecycle: (1) provide an entry to previously challenging-to-access functional polymers or to existing ones but from new feedstocks, (2) evolve one type of polymer into another with associated changes in material properties, and (3) enable the breakdown of otherwise intractable polymer backbones. Along the way, we describe our rationale behind the selection and development of reactions utilized for skeletal editing. We explain how small molecule reactions often need to be adapted to suit polymeric substrates and the methodology optimizations we needed to do to accomplish our edits. We also discuss the considerations involved in the selection or design of polymeric substrates for editing with an eye toward what edits can add to polymer function and how to advance the field. We conclude with an outlook on outstanding challenges that we aim to address in future work establishing areas for future exploration within each of our topic areas.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusOver the past decade, RNA-guided gene editing technologies, particularly those derived from CRISPR systems, have revolutionized life sciences and opened unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic innovation. Despite their transformative potential, achieving precise control over the activity and specificity of these molecular tools remains a formidable challenge, requiring advanced and innovative regulatory strategies. We and others have developed new approaches that integrate chemical ingenuity with bioorthogonal techniques to achieve remarkable precision in CRISPR regulation. One key innovation lies in the chemical modulation of guide RNA (gRNA), significantly expanding the CRISPR toolkit. Strategies such as CRISPR-ON and CRISPR-OFF switches rely on selective chemical masking and demasking of gRNA. These approaches use either bulky chemical groups to preemptively mask RNA or minor, less obstructive groups to fine-tune its function, followed by bioorthogonal reactions to restore or suppress activity. These methodologies have proven to be pivotal for controlled gene editing and expression, addressing the challenges of precision, reversibility, and dynamic regulation.Parallel to these advances, the development of mesoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising solution for RNA deprotection and activation. By serving as catalytic tools, MOFs enhance the versatility and efficiency of CRISPR systems, pushing their applications beyond the conventional boundaries. In addition, the synthesis of novel small molecules for regulating CRISPR-Cas9 activity marks a critical milestone in the evolution of gene therapy protocols. Innovative RNA structural control strategies have also emerged, particularly through the engineering of G-quadruplex (G4) motifs and G-G mismatches. These methods exploit the structural propensities of engineered gRNAs, employing small-molecule ligands to induce specific conformational changes that modulate the CRISPR activity. Whether stabilizing G4 formation or promoting G-G mismatches, these strategies demonstrate the precision and sophistication required for the molecular-level control of gene editing.Further enhancing these innovations, techniques like host-guest chemistry and conditional diacylation cross-linking have been developed to directly alter gRNA structure and function. These approaches provide nuanced, reversible, and safe control over CRISPR systems, advancing both the precision and reliability of gene editing technologies. In conclusion, this body of work highlights the convergence of chemistry, materials science, and molecular biology to create integrative solutions for gene editing. By combination of bioorthogonal chemistry, RNA engineering, and advanced materials, these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and control for both fundamental research and therapeutic applications. These innovations not only advance genetic research but also contribute to developing safer and more effective gene editing strategies, moving us closer to realizing the full potential of these technologies.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusAromatic rings are fundamental structural motifs found in natural products, synthetic intermediates, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. While transformations at the periphery of these rings are well-established, modifying their core frameworks has remained an underexplored frontier. Our group has pioneered the concept, termed \"aromatic metamorphosis\", enabling skeletal transformations of aromatic rings by replacing an endocyclic atom with a different atom or inserting an atom into aromatic rings, which leads to novel synthetic strategies and diverse molecular architectures.The concept of aromatic metamorphosis was first demonstrated in the stepwise conversion of dibenzothiophenes and dibenzofurans into triphenylenes. These transformations, facilitated by palladium and nickel catalysts, involve the strategic activation of robust C-S and C-O bonds as the key steps. Next, the approach was extended to the two-step conversions of dibenzothiophenes into carbazoles, dibenzophospholes, fluorenes, etc., which involve oxidation into the corresponding sulfones and subsequent sequential inter- and intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions. These new synthetic routes have provided efficient access to optoelectronic materials. Especially, the SNAr-based aromatic metamorphosis facilitated the construction of a heterohelicene library with systematic variation in endocyclic atoms. This strategy has revolutionized the way molecular libraries are constructed and enables the rapid discovery of functional molecules.In addition to the endocyclic substitutions, ring-expanding aromatic metamorphosis through atom insertion has also been explored. We developed nickel-catalyzed boron insertion into benzofurans, generating benzoxaborins, which are important scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. This novel catalytic transformation has been successfully scaled to industrial synthesis by companies, which demonstrates the practical utility of aromatic metamorphosis. Furthermore, manganese-catalyzed and lithium-metal-promoted methodologies have expanded the ranges of heteroatoms inserted and aromatic frameworks cleaved, providing methods to access heterocycles with a diversity in element compositions.Reductive dilithiation of thiophenes efficiently yields 1,4-dilithiobutadienes, which react with a variety of electrophiles to produce a series of nonbiogenic heteroles, such as boroles, phospholes, and siloles. In principle, this method should allow the sulfur atom in readily available thiophenes to be replaced with any atom and is therefore considered an ideal example of aromatic metamorphosis in terms of rapid construction of diverse chemical spaces with a variety of elements.Aromatic metamorphosis proposes many new synthons and retrosynthetic disconnections that defy the conventional wisdom of organic synthesis. By making full use of metamorphosing the aromatic skeleton, a library with skeletal diversity can be constructed directly with minimal effort and time investment. Its applications span from pharmaceuticals to materials science, paving the way for a new paradigm in molecular design as well as synthetic strategy.",

Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations.",

These unnatural enzymes are capable of synthesizing molecules that are either not amenable to biosynthesis or are extremely challenging to access chemically. PKSs can thus be a powerful platform to expand the chemical landscape beyond the limits of conventional metabolic engineering. Here we employ a retrobiosynthesis approach to design and construct PKSs to produce δ-valerolactam (VL) and three enantiopure α-substituted VL analogues that have no known biosynthetic route. We introduce the engineered PKSs and pathways for various malonyl-CoA derivatives into Pseudomonas putida and use proteomics, metabolomics and culture condition optimization to improve the production of our target compounds. These α-substituted VLs are polymerized into polyamides (nylon-5) or converted into their N-acryloyl derivatives. RAFT polymerization produces bio-derived polymers with potential biomedical applications. Overall, this interdisciplinary effort highlights the versatility and effectiveness of a PKS-based retrobiosynthesis approach in exploring and developing innovative biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The site-selective functionalization of C(sp\n            2)–H bonds represents a powerful strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds with broad applicability. Here we report efficient regioselective catalytic methods for the formation of benzyltrimethylsilanes through ruthenium-catalysed C(sp\n            2)–H silylmethylation. The developed protocols enable selective functionalization at both ortho and meta positions within arenes bearing N-based directing groups. The resulting silylmethyl compounds can undergo diverse transformations, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution, carbonyl addition, olefination and desilylation.

    "abstract": "AbstractMelanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane‐bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell‐SELEX and cell‐internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT‐1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT‐1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT‐1e, we engineered an aptamer‐based molecular tethering agent TTe‐TTe. We found that TTe‐TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe‐TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm‐shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.",

However, the high activation energy for C═O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single‐atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p‐xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO‐66‐NH2‐A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr‐oxo nodes of UiO‐66‐NH2 to form Cu–O–Zr sites. The Cu–O–Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro‐deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36 h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu–O–Zr sites also drives the reaction process.",

Another related subclass of type‐III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o‐aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o‐aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o‐aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso‐forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL‐24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso‐forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso‐forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o‐aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.",

By integrating a stereogenic carbon center into a fluorene scaffold, we create a unique interaction between a boron‐based multi‐resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) Lewis acid and an arylamine Lewis base. This sterically hindered design prevents strong charge transfer while optimizing the alignment between electric and magnetic dipole moments for amplified CPL signals. Our OLEDs achieve impressive electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) of 6.64 × 10−3, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 30.4%, and sub‐30 nm spectral linewidths. These improvements yield a Figure of Merit (FoM = EQE × |gEL|) of 1.91 × 10−3, the highest reported for center‐chiral CPL devices.

Despite these advantages, the development of B←N‐based n‐type polymers for high‐performance organic transistors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective B←N containing acceptor units. In this work, we address this challenge through the rational design and synthesis of two asymmetric half‐fused B←N functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives, BTBN and FBTBN. These compounds leverage the unique electronic properties of the B←N motif, enabling the development of two new n‐type polymers, PBTBN and PFBTBN. Notably, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBTBN and PFBTBN are significantly lowered by 0.2–0.3 eV compared to their counterparts without B←N functionalization, with PFBTBN achieving a LUMO of ∼ −4.0 eV. Importantly, PFBTBN exhibits exceptional unipolar n‐type transistor performance with a high electron mobility (µe) of 3.85 cm2 V−1 s−1. The asymmetric half‐fused B←N molecular backbone not only stabilizes the electronic structure but also induces a near‐amorphous morphology, thereby enabling PFBTBN‐based flexible transistors to retain a high µe of 3.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 even after 1000 bending cycles. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of incorporating asymmetric B←N functionalized acceptors for high‐performance n‐type semiconducting polymers.",

Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen‐deficient TiO2 under an air‐level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31 mg gcat−1 h−1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen‐free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to •NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen‐derived O2•–. This •NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air‐level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to •NH2 while preventing over‐oxidation.",

Here, we report the employment of l‐citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (─COOH, ─NH2) and urea (─NH─CO─NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I−. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain‐size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive δ phase to result in suppressed trap‐assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent‐free slot‐die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.",

Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co‐containing Li‐rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high‐voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice‐coherent Li‐rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high‐voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li‐rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6 V and even at 4.7 V.

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3‐butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy‐intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure–performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu‐MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as‐designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3‐MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C–C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3‐butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3‐butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3‐MOF affords a 1,3‐butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3‐butadiene production rate of 64 mmol g−1 h−1, which is about 2‐fold and 20‐fold higher than Cu2‐MOF and Cu1‐MOF. This work not only provides profound insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of acetylene hydrodimerization but also guides the rational design of high‐activity electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHypoxia‐induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron‐affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose‐dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene‐functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2‐Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4‐nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia‐selective toxicity arises from reductase‐mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2‐Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen‐mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster‐based hypoxic radiosensitizers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRechargeable zinc metal batteries (RZMBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high capacity and cost‐effectiveness. However, their commercialization is hindered by challenges including dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation, particularly under low current densities and negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratios. Localized high‐concentration electrolytes offer potential solutions, but their reliance on high salt concentrations to replicate solvation structures of high‐concentration electrolytes limits their practicality, due to diluent's inherent inertness that limits its role in interfacial chemistry. Here, we present a co‐regulation strategy that integrates bulk and interfacial properties to develop an interfacial‐enhanced localized high‐concentration electrolyte (ILHCE). By incorporating non‐coordinating 1,4‐dioxane diluent and 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium (emim+) cations into dilute aqueous electrolytes, dioxane molecules are pulled into electric double layer (EDL) through the interaction between emim+ and dioxane, achieving a pronounced dilution effect from bulk electrolyte to the EDL. This generates an anion‐rich and water‐depleted EDL at both anode and cathode interfaces, enhancing Zn2+ transport dynamics, ensuring cathode stability and deriving a robust anion‐derived solid‐electrolyte interphase. Full batteries using Mn0.5V6O13 cathodes with a low N/P ratio of 1.77 demonstrate 80% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, highlighting ILHCE as a transformative electrolyte design toward real‐world applications.",

Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high‐dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd–Co–P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46 A mgPd−1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12 A mgPd−1) and Pt/C (0.17 A mgPt−1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40 V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and Density Functional Theory calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd–Co–P interfaces could direct the two‐dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film‐like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.",

However, current SSEs still face challenges of balancing stability and ionic conductivity, which limits their practical applications in solid‐state Li batteries. Here, we report a general strategy for achieving high‐performance SSEs by constructing a Li+‐conducted polymeric metal–organic nanocapsule (PolyMONC(Li)) network through molecular design. With the unique cage structure and pore size, metal–organic nanocapsule (MONC) can achieve excellent anion confinement effects. The PolyMONC(Li) network with continuous Li+ conduction pathways serves as a solid electrolyte exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (0.18 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.83). Combining the two superiorities of optimal balance between mechanical strength and excellent Li+ conductivity, the PolyMONC(Li) can still restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short‐circuiting even over 900 h cycling. The PolyMONC(Li)‐based SSEs Li‐metal batteries achieved a higher specific capacity than common polymer electrolytes such as polyethylene oxide‐based SSE. Additionally, taking advantage of the PolyMONC(Li) electrode binder, the solid‐state Li–O2 battery achieves a stable cycling over 400 cycles.

While notable progress has been made on the direct modification of various nitrogen‐ and oxygen‐heterocycles, editing of prevalent sulfur‐containing heteroarenes, especially for single‐atom insertion, remains exceedingly rare. This disparity is primarily attributed to the sulfur atom's inherent nucleophilicity and high susceptibility to oxidation. Here we present a conceptually distinct photocatalytic strategy that enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes, furnishing previously inaccessible cyclic thioborane scaffolds and synthetically valuable alkyl boronates in an efficient manner.

The free‐energy surface of this first step is obtained by combining on‐the‐fly probability‐enhanced sampling and machine learning potentials at the hybrid functional level of accuracy. Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent with kinetic‐isotope‐effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to  eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom. The presented framework can be generally applied to other PCET steps and other oxides, thus opening the door to a comprehensive investigation of the OER mechanism at oxide–water interfaces.",

Synthesized via low‐temperature carbonization, S‐FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC‐STEM. The POD‐specific activity of S‐FeCDs reached 295 U mg−1, which is 11.2‐fold higher than that of sulfur‐free FeCDs, with natural enzyme‐like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the ΔG for H2O2‐to‐·OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate‐determining step (2*OH → *O + *H2O) from 2.50 to 1.62 eV. In vivo, S‐FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA‐infected wound models, achieving near‐complete healing within 7 days.

We report herein two ambient‐stable conjugated RPs (RPH and RPC), synthetically obtained by an unprecedented straightforward copolymerization of two brominated diradical monomers (diradical characters up to 0.88) with bis‐stannylated DPP units. Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open‐shell ground state, the diradical‐derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin‐delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of S = 1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near‐infrared absorptions beyond 1000 nm, multi‐stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing π‐paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin‐film state RPH exhibited superior ambipolar carrier‐transporting properties with well‐balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as attractive room‐temperature quantum coherence times (T1 = 1.88 µs, T2 = 218 ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations.

The reinforced and homogeneous anchorage by multiple repeat phosphonic acid groups onto NiOx significantly optimise the bottom interface, suppress unfavourable interfacial reactions and thus alleviate phase segregation of WBG perovskite.

Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.",

Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide ent‐copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of ent‐copalol to 19‐hydroxy‐ent‐copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin. Then ApCYP706U5 accomplishes the third step by mediating the C‐3 hydroxylation reaction, thereby allowing the formation of 14‐deoxyandrographolide. Ultimately, ApCYP72F1 completes the biosynthetic generation of andrographolide with C‐14 hydroxylation of the lactone and rearrangement of the olefin bond. In addition, co‐expression of the minimal gene set in N. benthamiana engineered to produce ent‐copalol feasibly produces andrographolide, thus establishing an innovative metabolic engineering strategy to produce this medicine of historical importance, circumventing the need for plant extraction.",

Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycles toward circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single‐component self‐blowing vitrimer foam. The self‐blowing mechanism originates from the in situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a β‐hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine‐tuned to develop various foams that have an open‐cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%–853%, porosity of 67%–86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3–38 MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine‐co‐ester) network composed of β‐hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and β‐aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam‐to‐resin reprocessing.",

Herein, we designed the robust Pt single‐atom sites supported on NiAl layered double hydroxide (Pt1/NiAl‐LDH) and intermetallic compound (Pt1/NiAl‐IMC) with distinct local charge density for selectivity‐controllable hydrodeoxygenation of lignin. The Pt1/NiAl‐LDH with electron‐deficient Pt sites hydrogenated 4‐propylguaiacol into 4‐propylcyclohexanol with 100% conversion and over 90% selectivity, while Pt1/NiAl‐IMC with electron‐rich Pt sites favored complete deoxygenation, yielding almost equivalent of propylcyclohexane. Similar results were achieved using lignin samples. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the deoxygenation capacity of Pt1/NiAl‐IMC stems from the high electronic density of Pt single atoms, which injects electrons into the C─O bond and weakens its bonding energy. This study demonstrates that the catalytic performance of single‐atom catalysts in biopolymers hydrodeoxygenation can be optimized toward different products by well‐controlled electronic structures.",

Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4‐hydroalkylation, alkene isomerization, and [2 + 2] cycloaddition via an intertwined single electron transfer (SET)/energy transfer (EnT) nature. This protocol provided a divergent synthetic approach for constructing (pseudo)‐dimeric cyclobutane‐fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds.

However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and undesirable charge carrier transfer, predominantly limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI3 PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3‐difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluorination‐assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate the passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transfer at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high‐performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.",

However, degradation of traditional electrolytes restricts high cut‐off voltage tLi+) lead to polarization and early charge/discharge termination, which typically necessitate use of multiple solvents or salt‐concentrated electrolytes to enable high‐voltage chemistry. To address this challenge, we developed a single‐solvent, single‐salt electrolyte with tris(2,2,2‐trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), achieving a high tLi+ of 0.78 and enabling ultra‐high‐voltage LMB operation up to 5.0 V. Large molecular sterics and electron density delocalization of TFEP enabled dominant presence of local aggregates (AGGs), which further populated to form large and ion‐rich weakly‐solvating nanometric aggregates (n‐AGGs), changing redox properties and promoting the interfacial stabilities to a greater extent. As a result, we showed suppressed dendrite formation with stable cycling for over 1500 h, and full‐cell operations paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) at 4.7 V and with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) at 5.0 V.

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring well‐defined metal active sites and unique coordination environment, have recently emerged as ideal model catalysts for establishing precise structure‐activity relationships in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, elucidating essential catalytic mechanisms responsible for dynamic reaction conditions remain challenging, primarily due to the complicated adsorption behavior and cross‐step transfer of key adsorbates during OER. Herein, we propose a defect‐driven stepwise activation strategy to meticulously control the adsorption behavior for defective Co‐based MOF (termed D/CoFc‐MOF) through tailoring the interplay between local coordination geometry and electronic configuration. Operando characterizations reveal that D/CoFc‐MOF undergoes a unique stepwise activation during OER, progressing from pristine MOF state to intermediate α‐FeOOH state, and ultimately to active CoFeOOH phase, which markedly differs from conventional single‐step surface phase conversion. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electronic interaction between the active Co sites and OOH* intermediates of MOF‐derived defective CoFeOOH can be effectively strengthened, thereby overcoming the high reaction barrier and enhancing OER activity. The D/CoFc‐MOF anode, deployed in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves industrial‐scale current densities of 1 A cm−2 at 1.69 V and operates stably for 300 h. This approach provides a fundamental insight into designing catalysts prone to dynamic phase transitions.",

Herein, a topotactic conversion cum covalent functionalization strategy is invoked to craft a catalyst with confined and modulated surfaces that can bias the reaction heavily for ethylene production with a 22‐fold boost in the ethylene/ethanol ratio. The well‐tuned covalent structural motif of ─Si─O─Cu─ on PDMS‐Cu2O/C dramatically elevates the C2H4‐forming activity with a faradaic efficiency reaching up to 71% and a high partial current density of 513.6 mA cm−2. Operando infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations unveil the ultralow coordination number and the upshifted d‐band center. Notably, modulating the d‐band center with the covalently elaborated surfaces allows control of the adsorption energies of CHO* and other intermediates along the ethylene path, largely lowering energy barriers for the key steps, particularly the formation of CH2CHO*.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3−RR) holds tremendous potential for remediating NO3− pollution while enabling clean ammonia (NH3) production. However, most catalysts achieve high conversion efficiency relying on high NO3− concentrations. How to catalyze the NO3−RR with a low concentration of NO3− is still a challenge due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we constructed a novel asymmetric isolated Mn atom based on N‐coordination covalent organic framework (COF) (ImPy‐COF‐Mn), for efficient NO3−RR at a low NO3− concentration of 2 mg mL−1. This bidentate‐coordinated COF featured a robust and chemically stable framework, while the synergistic interaction between asymmetric imine N and pyridine N modified the charge distribution of Mn atoms to optimize catalytic efficiency. ImPy‐COF‐Mn demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, with 95.64% NH3 selectivity and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 1927 mmol h−1 gcat.−1, exceeding the corresponding parameters of symmetric Mn sites by factors of 1.27 and 1.41, respectively. In situ ATR‐FTIR measurements and theoretical calculations revealed that the asymmetric isolated Mn facilitated a reduction in the energy barrier for *NO‐to‐*NOH conversion, and thus contributed to higher activity and selectivity.",

Here, we utilized organic cations to exfoliate bulk PHI and fabricate PHI nanosheets for producing H2O2 at a rate of 27.35 mmol g−1 h−1 under simulated solar light irradiation, outperforming most of the reported carbon nitride‐based catalysts. Importantly, after 36 h of cyclic accumulation reactions in a self‐created spiral flow reactor, the H2O2 concentration stabilized at 2.7 wt.%, close to medical sterilization levels. In situ spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory calculations revealed that the exfoliation results in molecular reconfiguration of the PHI basal planes, forming the active sites to promote charge separation and electron localization. This new structure also creates midgap states, enabling direct H2O2 production via a one‐step, two‐electron pathway, bypassing the superoxide radical pathway. Theoretical calculations suggest that the localized electronic structure created by the active sites favors the protonation of adsorbed O2 and stabilizes the *OOH species, which converts to H2O2. This study elucidates and underscores the importance of active‐site reconfiguration for efficient photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways.",

Herein, a novel high‐entropy SEI layer rich in inorganic components is designed and constructed via in situ electrochemical conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer on a porous scaffold. Theoretical studies and experimental techniques reveal that the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 heterostructure, with its low work function and weak Sn─O/S bond, significantly enhances reactivity with the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the in situ formation of the high‐entropy SEI layer. The in situ generated high‐entropy SEI exhibits low surface roughness, low surface potential, fast potassium ion transport characteristics, and excellent mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 20.08 GPa). Leveraging these advantageous properties of the high‐entropy SEI, the resulting potassium metal anode achieves an excellent rate performance up to 10 mA cm−2 in symmetric cells and demonstrates outstanding cycling stability for 2500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2. When paired with a perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode, the potassium metal full battery retains 81.6% of its capacity over 1650 cycles at 10 C. This work underscores a straightforward and effective approach for the establishment of a stable interphase on metallic potassium anodes.",

However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site‐selective electrostatic co‐assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co‐assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)‐block‐poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co‐assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber‐like moieties. The co‐assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co‐assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher‐order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.",

Its high optical dispersion, extraordinarily high mechanical strength, and unparalleled thermal conductivity have long made it a material of interest for applications such as high‐temperature electronics and as wear‐resistance coatings. More recently, diamond has emerged as a material with a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology. The high intrinsic stability of diamond, coupled with the ability to modify diamond surfaces with a wide range of inorganic, organic, and biological species via highly stable covalent linkages, provides a wealth of opportunity to couple diamond's chemical properties with its extraordinary physical properties. The practical utility of diamond has been greatly expanded in recent years through dramatic advances in the ability to produce diamond in bulk, thin film, and nanoparticle form, with controlled doping and purity at modest cost. These advances, together with diamond's highly stable and tunable surface chemistry with versatility of physical structure enable a wide range of emerging applications of interest to chemists, including quantum science, biomedicine, energy storage, and catalysis. Yet, to fully exploit the unique properties of diamond, some formidable chemical challenges lie ahead.We begin by reviewing some of the features of diamond that are of particular importance to the chemistry community. We aim to highlight some of the important applications where diamond chemistry plays a key role, identify some of the key observations, and outline some of the future directions and opportunities for diamond in the chemical world.",

Herein, combining operando X‐ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy with scanning probe microscope, we have first established the correlations between CO2 photoreduction activities and crystal‐structure/active‐site of defective ZnAl layered double hydroxides (ZnAl‐LDH). Specifically, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in ZnAl‐LDH could effectively promote the selective adsorption of both CO2 and H2O molecules on surface Al and Zn active sites, respectively, leading to opposite transition states and the evident shrinking of crystalline structures. Under light irradiation, the adsorbed CO2 molecules transformed into *COOH intermediate on surface Al active sites, while the H2O molecules dissociated into OH group on Zn sites to provide proton, simultaneously leading to the expansion of crystalline structures and increase of layer spacing. Accordingly, these defect‐dependent evolutions of surface active sites and crystalline structure contributed to the significant improvement of CO2 reduction to CO activity (17.2 µmol g−1 h−1), much higher than that of pristine ZnAl‐LDH (6.3 µmol g−1 h−1).

Structural characterization, transient absorption, and temperature‐dependent dynamics were investigated to elucidate the narrowband mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the high symmetry and substantial conjugation of the graphitic core enhance material rigidity with minimal exciton‐capturing defects. The high pyrrole N content increases the conjugated electron delocalization, promoting radiative recombination of confined electrons and holes, thereby reducing FWHM. In addition, the large exciton binding energy, weak electron‐phonon coupling, and simple radiative dynamics of the CDs further contribute to their ultra‐narrow emission bandwidths. The CDs exhibit exceptional photo and thermal stabilities in extremely acidic or alkaline conditions and various organic solvents. No quenching or peak broadening is observed at high CD concentrations, rendering these materials suitable for applications in high‐performance optoelectronic devices. Excitingly, CD‐based light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000 mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150 h at 300 mA.

H3 efficiently transports protons while rejecting other ions and water molecules by forming multiple hydrogen bonding chains like natural proton channels. Patch clamp experiments revealed that H3 facilitates rapid proton transport (γH+ = 181 ± 4 pS) comparable to that of natural gramicidin A (γH+ = 213 ± 4 pS) and demonstrates high H+‐selectivity, with PH+/PK+, PH+/PNa+, and PH+/PCl‐ values reaching 78.4, 233.2, and 167.8, respectively. H3‐induced proton transport causes elevated lysosomal pH and mitochondrial damage, ultimately resulting in severe cancer cell apoptosis (IC50: 0.23 µM for U87MG; 1.04 µM for B16F10).

    "abstract": "AbstractThe design and synthesis of novel hybrid metal halides polymorphs with full‐color tunable emission are critical for the advancement of solid‐state lighting and display technologies. However, it remains challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we successfully synthesized three new zero‐dimensional (0D) hybrid isomeric copper (I) halides, namely α‐/β‐/γ‐(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 (where BuPh3P+ = butyltriphenylphosphonium, C22H24P+), featuring the same edge‐sharing [Cu2I4]2− units. Notably, the monoclinic α‐(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 and β‐(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4, both belonging to the P21/n space group, exhibit bright blue and orange emission, respectively. The orthorhombic‐phase γ‐(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 with space group Pbca and larger lattice volume shows vivid red emission, thus achieving tunable full‐color emission wavelength spanning from blue (445 nm) to red (667 nm), representing the first instance of such broad tunability through adjusting the spatial arrangement of the organic and inorganic parts. Interestingly, α‐(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 undergoes a reversible photo‐induced fluorochromism, transitioning from blue to green. Furthermore, a reversible phase transformation between α‐ and β‐(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 can be triggered by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. As such, a photo‐responsive switchable system and a multistage information encryption/decryption system are successfully devised through leveraging unique multi‐stimuli‐responsive properties.",

They are widely known to exhibit diverse pharmacological effects by acting on μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors (MOR, DOR, and KOR). Naltrexone, a commercially available 4,5-epoxymorphinan alkaloid, is a drug primarily used to manage alcohol and opioid dependence. From a pharmacological perspective, naltrexone is classified as an MOR antagonist. On the other hand, from an organic chemistry perspective, naltrexone contains a wealth of functional groups and possesses four consecutive asymmetric centers within a single molecule, giving rise to its unique chemical reactivity. While this reactivity may not be universally applicable, gaining a clear understanding of it is crucial for researchers working on the organic chemistry of morphinan alkaloids. In this account, we provide a comprehensive overview of our research findings over the past decade, with a particular focus on the specific reactions of the 4,5-epoxymorphinan framework.

Most of these compounds are based on complex D–A–D structures or multi-D–A systems, such as 4CzIPN. Whereas these systems have been widely studied and applied as photocatalysts, simpler D–A structures remain less explored. Nevertheless, the simplicity of D–A structures makes them the ideal structures to further understand the structure–property relationship of D–A molecules for optimizing their photocatalytic performance by simpler modification of the different D–A subunits. In particular, D–A structures featuring sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors have gained increasing attention for their use as photoredox catalysts. This study introduces a new family of D–A molecules by exploring various sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors, including a novel tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) unit and 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine (IMD). Our findings demonstrate that these simple D–A structures exhibit promising photocatalytic properties, comparable to those of more complex D–A–D systems.",

This review categorizes recent literatures focusing on key regulatory factors for product divergent formation, in which controlling chemical selectivity primarily relies on ligands, metal catalysts, solvents, time, temperature, acids/bases, and subtle modifications of substrates. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying reaction activity and selectivity differentiation, the review provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms of critical steps through specific case studies.

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also known to be significantly influenced by the interfacial charge and mass transfer in a catalyst/H2O biphase system. Herein, for the first time, a highly stable and floating hydrogen‐water cogeneration hybrid hydrogel that utilizes photothermal‐induced interface microenvironment variation to accelerate sluggish photocatalytic water splitting reaction is reported. Supported by solar‐powered interfacial evaporation and efficient vapor generation, the rationally designed hydrogel effectively transforms the conventional liquid‐solid interface into a gas‐solid photocatalytic interface. The presence of gas‐liquid coexistence state offers a disordered and loose hydrogen‐bond network while preserving the proton transfer channel, greatly reducing reaction activation energy and interfacial energy barriers. The improved heat and mass transfer together with optimized charge transfer pathways suppress electron‐hole recombination, the integrated photothermal‐coupled solar photocatalytic hydrogel exhibits excellent operational stability and self‐adaptive rotation in seawater, mitigating salt accumulation and achieving an exceptional vapor generation rate of 4.71 kg m−2 h−1 and a hydrogen‐evolving rate of 1961.25 µmol g−1 h−1 under one sun illumination.",

However, conventional polymeric membranes are constrained by permeability‐selectivity trade‐off and instability under real‐world operating conditions. While covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold promise, their overlarge pores and poor film‐processibility are to be imperatively solved. Herein, a ternary building unit system is designed for synthesizing imine‐based COF nanosheets with programmable interlayer offsets. By synergizing a planar aldehyde monomer as the basic structural unit and a none‐planar alkyl‐functionalized aldehyde monomer as the structure regulation unit, we induce layer distortion that disrupts π–π dominated AA stacking, enabling angstrom‐precise pore tuning (1.4–0.6 nm) via controlled transitions to AB stacking while retaining crystallinity. The mechanically robust nanosheets are easily assembled into large‐area membranes via a facile blade casting, overcoming the processability bottleneck associated with binary building unit systems. The resulting membranes demonstrate an exceptional H2/CO2 selectivity of 60, surpassing existing benchmarks. When treating gas mixtures from methanol steam reforming, a two‐stage membrane process achieves 99.5% H2 purity and 94.0% recovery. Precise modulation of pore architecture and mechanical flexibility through building units engineered stacking affords a platform for microporous organic membranes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAchieving multiple types of resistive switching in a single material with controlled ionic motion is a key challenge in neuromorphic computing, traditionally addressed by combining materials with distinct switching behaviors. Here, Cu2‐xS is identified as a promising candidate to overcome this limitation due to its hierarchical phase transitions. Using in situ biasing experiments, reversible and non‐reversible phase transitions (and resistive switching) are demonstrated in γ‐Cu2S by controlling the compliance current. The formation of parallel high‐digenite Cu1.8S channels, orientated along the γ‐Cu2S [201] crystallographic direction, drives the nonvolatile resistive switching. These channels emerge via an intermediate δ‐Cu2S phase and are stabilized at room temperature by residual strains, alongside β‐Cu2S phase. The work clarifies the complex, electrically triggered phase transformations in γ‐Cu2S, and highlights the potential of Cu2‐xS as a versatile material for neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "Abstractπ‐conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability. Nevertheless, the effective control over their dielectric properties is a challenge. Herein, the charge carrier migration in π‐conjugated MOFs is harnessed to significantly amplify the electromagnetic response, where the strengthened atom coordination can activate a distinctive conductance‐reinforced attenuation mechanism. This results in finely calibrated EMW absorption characteristics, including a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at mere 2 mm, a minimum reflection loss of −46.7 dB at 3.5 mm, and a substantial reduction in radar cross‐section (RCS) up to −23.3 dBm2. Furthermore, the seamless integration of the π‐conjugated MOF hybrids within ultraviolet (UV)‐curable 3D printing technology has enabled the fabrication of a stealth‐enabled drone propeller prototype, which exhibits a remarkably low infrared emissivity of 0.205. Additionally, when the propeller device is subjected to a 100 °C heating platform for 30 min, its surface temperature remains below 50 °C, demonstrating exceptional thermal management and stability under elevated temperature conditions. This work underscores the immense potential of these cutting‐edge absorbers to shape the future of advanced military stealth technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising thermoelectric cooling candidate, exhibiting room‐temperature performance comparable to that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). However, the Seebeck coefficient of p‐type SnSe crystals remains significantly lower than that of n‐type Bi₂(Te, Se)₃ (BTS), and the resulting mismatches hinder effective utilization of its excellent cooling potential. To address this limitation, resonant levels are introduced in the valence bands of hole‐doped SnSe through indium‐doping, which increased the density of states and thereby boosted the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy enable the power factor to reach ≈55 µWcm−1K−2 and ZT value of ≈1.0 at 300 K, with a more matching Seebeck coefficient of ≈211 µVK−1. Furthermore, a full‐scale thermoelectric cooler incorporating the p‐type SnSe paired with n‐type BTS demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference (ΔTmax) of ≈81.1 K at 343 K. A SnSe‐based single‐leg device achieve a conversion efficiency of ≈7.0% under a ΔT of 250 K. These findings highlight that matching thermoelectric parameter of p‐type and n‐type materials is crucial for enhancing the cooling efficiency of devices, and engineering resonant energy levels constitutes a robust strategy for solving the inherent performance limitations of p‐type SnSe in practical thermoelectric applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA cell can bind to itself and form a self‐adhesion that can be engineered and harnessed as a new way to adhere cells to engineered materials–a key challenge for biomaterials are demonstrated. Here, a 3D structure smaller is developed than a single cell, that a Self‐Adhesion‐Tunnel (SAT) is called, that causes cells to wrap around it and bind to themselves. This process is driven through the cadherin proteins that regulate cell‐cell adhesion, and it is shown that many of the key elements of a normal cell‐cell adhesion are found in self‐adhesions. Size and shape of the SAT determine the efficiency of self‐adhesion formation, and >90% efficient formation of self‐adhesions are observed in both kidney and skin cells per SAT. Self‐adhesions can persist for at least 24 hrs and act to stabilize the cell‐material interface and reduce migration. Overall, this ability to co‐opt the native cell‐cell adhesion machinery in cells and use it as an attachment strategy can provide new approaches for soft‐tissue implant integration and tissue engineering scaffolds where stable tissue‐material interfaces are critical.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIon transport in environments with mixed ions is crucial for numerous real‐world applications. However, most membranes suffer from reduced selectivity in the mixed ion environment. Herein, the concept of dual‐nanoconfined channels in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated for superior mixed mono‐/multivalent ion separation. By incorporating acidic functionalities into the pore wall and coupling with a suitable pore size in the COF membranes, multivalent ions interact strongly with the acidic groups. This shields the interactions of the wall with monovalent ions, leaves sufficient space for fast monovalent ion passage, and in the meantime blocks multivalent ions, creating well‐defined dual‐nanoconfinement for mixed ion separation. Consequently, mixed Li+/Mg2+ ion selectivity exceeding 1,300 and mono‐/trivalent ion selectivity over 9,000 is achieved. Molecular dynamics simulation and experiment with multiple ion pairs further confirm the mechanisms. The study sheds light on a fundamentally new design principle for mixed ion separation, offering the potential to reach remarkable selectivity in practical applications.",

By combining multiple layers of these synthetic chromatophores, soft skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities that leverage halftone absorption, optical interference, and microlensing are demonstrated. These skins, made entirely of soft materials, are inherently stretchable and can be programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli, making them well‐suited for applications in soft robotics and human‐machine interfaces.",

However, the clinical use of neuroregulatory strategies for repairing infarcted myocardium, such as vagus nerve stimulation and pharmacological activation, confronts the challenges of managing stimulation signals and potential drug side effects. In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a “pre‐neuralized” scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. Strontium silicate promotes NSCs differentiation, resulting in a scaffold enriched with mature neurons. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that enhance the maturation and synchronized contraction of cardiomyocytes, facilitating myocardial repair and improving cardiac function in vivo. The findings indicate that the pre‐neuralized scaffold aids myocardial recovery by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural‐induced regulation in tissue repair. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to repairing infarcted myocardium using inorganic biomaterial‐induced scaffolds with neuromodulatory properties from the perspective of systemically physiological regulation. This work may offer a new perspective for addressing complex tissue and organ injuries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of advanced Li‐ and Mn‐rich layered cathodes (LRO) is essential for high‐energy lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, LRO exhibits large voltage hysteresis and rapid voltage decay with irreversible TM migration upon prolonged cycling. Given that high‐entropy oxides have expanded the potential for retarding the harmful phase transition and regulating the site energies, therefore a high‐entropy Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.12Co0.12Mg0.03Cu0.02Ti0.02Nb0.02O2 cathode is synthesized (HELRO) for LIBs in the present study, demonstrated significantly improved voltage retention and energy output. In addition, this work unveils the sluggish degradation of superlattice and local structure in HELRO during long charge–discharge cycles and explains the “migration retardation effect.” The higher configurational entropy contributes to the higher energy barriers for in‐plane, out‐of‐plane, and continuous Mn migrations due to the synergistic ionic–covalent enhancement of Mn─O bonds. This work provides new insights for understanding the improvement mechanisms of high entropy cathodes and demonstrates the feasibility of suppressing long‐standing voltage decay by high entropy design combining covalent and ionic elements.",

    "abstract": "AbstractQuantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QLEDs) usually exhibit a positive aging phenomenon with their efficiency and brightness increase after storage for several days. Although positive aging enhances device performance, its random and uncontrollable process presents substantial challenges for QLED industrialization. Here, It is identified that the H2O, produced by the reaction between the acidic resin and ZnMgO, can slowly passivate the defects of ZnMgO and is thus responsible for the positive aging. By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post‐annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. As a result, the fresh devices exhibit a high efficiency of 55.2 lm W−1 (26%), which is 2.04 (1.67)‐fold higher than those of untreated devices and 1.21 (1.02)‐fold higher than those of untreated devices after positive aging. Moreover, the performance of the treated devices remains very stable even after storage for several days, indicating the undesired positive aging is completely eliminated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, can promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.",

In particular, the latter spinel exhibits a room-temperature ionic conductivity exceeding 10-4 S cm-1 and a low Mg2+ migration barrier of 364 meV. The high ionic mobility is attributed to the low magnesium insertion energy revealed by density functional theory (DFT), which indicates a weak binding interaction between magnesium ions and the host lattice. Furthermore, like the two multicomponent spinels, MgYb2Se4 exhibits lower electronic conductivity compared to previously studied MgB2Se4 spinels (B = Sc, Y, Er, Tm) and a good electrochemical stability, making it a strong candidate for Mg2+ SE applications.",

    "abstract": "Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have garnered considerable interest, owing to their advantageous optoelectronic properties and ease of synthesis. However, understanding their intricate structure-property relationships remains challenging, for both bulk and nanoscale forms, such as colloidal quantum dots (QDs). In this study, in addition to conventional characterization by X-ray diffraction and optical absorption, we show that variable temperature solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by computational modeling, provides unique insight into the local coordination geometry and electronic structure of LHPs in relation to the moderate change in composition or materials morphology. For CsPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 in the form of QDs and bulk, we uncover nuanced disparities between their orthorhombic and on-average cubic structures, respectively, reflected in their temperature-dependent 207Pb chemical shifts and optical band gaps. Specifically, the mode of thermal expansion, be it the increase of the Pb-Br-Pb angles in the orthorhombic structure or the elongation of the Pb-Br bonds in a cubic lattice, gives rise to an increase of the chemical shift by 0.63 or 1.53 ppm/K and optical band gap by 0.18 or 0.66 meV/K, respectively. Identifying the chemical shift as a spectroscopic descriptor, in particular as a lattice ruler, is highly instrumental also for LHP QDs, capturing the difference between CsPbBr3 and FAPbBr3. In a broader perspective, establishing relations across spectroscopic and structural descriptors for diverse LHP compositions and morphologies paves the way for informed design strategies in next-generation optoelectronic devices.",

The crystal structure variation of these materials during redox reactions is key to the performance of a chemical looping system. Pair distribution function analysis of neutron total scattering data has provided new insight into the local structure of these materials before and after reduction to their working states. Comparison with experimental data for structurally related vacancy-ordered SrFeO3 -δ compounds (Sr8Fe8O23, Sr4Fe4O11, and Sr2Fe2O5) allows direct qualitative insight into local B-site coordination environments. A big-box modeling approach incorporating magnetic contributions to the Bragg data on supercells with A- and B-site disorder and mixed B-site coordination gives quantitative information on local structural distortions and coordination polyhedra. For the Mn-doped materials, this modeling shows that Mn has a higher oxidation state than Fe in oxidized samples. Magnetic structures of all ordered compounds have been determined from neutron powder diffraction data, and variable-temperature studies of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3, La0.6Sr0.4FeO2.8, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.67Mn0.33O3, and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.67Mn0.33O2.8 have been used to determine magnetic ordering temperatures.",

Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a rare instance of a thermosalient organic solid that exhibits the effect below room temperature. The crystals of this carbazole-based material are dynamic at both molecular and macroscopic scales. Using variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction and variable-temperature solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), we thoroughly examined the hysteretic structural transition in this material, emphasizing its macroscopic reconfigurability. We discovered unexpected large-amplitude molecular oscillations in the low-temperature phase, which challenge conventional assumptions about salient materials. Notably, we combined 2H ssNMR with computational modeling to reveal this dual-scale dynamism, setting the groundwork for advancements in energy-efficient actuators, sensors, and intelligent materials. This work might open new avenues for developing crystalline materials that can be implemented in innovative devices operating seamlessly across various scales.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConcrete, the world's second most utilized material after water, is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse emissions. Current carbon capturing and storage (CCS) concrete often involves convoluted processes, slow kinetics, limited CO2 uptake, non‐uniform carbonation in structures, and high cost. Efforts to enhance carbon sequestration often rely on increasing porosities, which compromise the mechanical strength of the resulting concrete. The 3D printing of CCS concrete is reported by incorporating diatomaceous earth (DE), a highly accessible biomineral with hierarchical porosity, into triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures. DE enables stable extrusion, high print fidelity, and reduced density, which are crucial for 3D concrete printing. Further, DE facilitates CaCO3 nucleation within the concrete and mitigates carbonation resistance, achieving a maximum CO2 absorption of 488.7 gCO2 per kg cement in 7 days, a 142% increase over conventional concrete. Optimizing TPMS geometry further enhances carbonation efficiency by enabling uniform CO2 uptake throughout the structure. This geometry refinement reduces material usage by 78% and increases the surface‐area‐to‐volume ratio by 515%, leading to a 30% higher CO2 uptake while preserving mechanical integrity. The material strategy, together with the optimized concrete printing of TPMS structures, offers a pathway toward scalable and sustainable solutions without undermining concrete's structural functions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSpinel LiMn2O4 is a promising cathode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to its nontoxicity, resource abundance, substantial operating voltage, and remarkable thermal stability. Nevertheless, LiMn2O4 is subjected to subpar electronic/ion conductivity and continuous capacity attenuation triggered by the Jahn‐Teller distortion. In this regard, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential morphological controllers that impact particle size and crystal orientation and offer vacancy‐accepting layers that facilitate oxygen defect formation, which boost electron/ion diffusion when utilized as self‐sacrificial templates. The dissatisfying capacity retention caused by Mn2+ dissolution related to the Mn3+ disproportion is another tricky issue, which requires resolution through surface modification. To attain these goals, this work develops a strategy intermarrying the merits of oxygen defects and Zn‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework‐62 (Zn‐ZIF‐62) glass shields. Mn‐MOFs with carboxyl‐based ligands possessing various coordination numbers are adopted as precursors to optimize the morphological feature and modulate the oxygen vacancy level. Computational and experimental results examine the efficaciousness of oxygen defects in ameliorating the electrochemical activity and expediting electron/ion transportation. Synchronously, the ZIF‐62 glass layer inhibits manganese loss and phase degradation toward prolonged cycling durability in LIB half/full cells. This study envisions a versatile methodology to modify spinel LiMn2O4 as a longevous cathode for next‐generation LIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractStructured catalysts, characterized by continuous, highly porous architectures, have long been recognized for their ability to enhance thermal stability, mechanical robustness, and operational efficiency in catalytic processes. Nevertheless, the use of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their exceptional atomic efficiency, in structured, shaped, or printed forms remains an emerging challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in maintaining atomic dispersion and ensuring stability under processing and reaction conditions. This review explores recent developments in the design and use of structured single‐atom catalysts (collectively referred to as stru‐SACs herein), focusing on their unique properties and the potential benefits of combining the atomic precision of SACs with engineered architectures. The composition of structured supports, ranging from traditional materials, such as ceramics and metals, to advanced materials, such as graphene, carbon, and aerogels, are examined. Additionally, functional active sites, innovative fabrication strategies, and advanced characterization techniques required to probe the atomic‐scale environments of stru‐SACs are discussed. The applications of stru‐SACs are reviewed across thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis, with an emphasis on how the electronic and structural characteristics of these materials enhance the catalytic performance.

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the growing scarcity of worldwide energy and freshwater resources, utilizing abundant seawater for hydrogen production via electrolysis has become imperative. However, due to the multi‐electron intermediate process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the competition reaction/erosion from Cl−, the design of highly selective and corrosion‐resistant seawater electrocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, Ce‐decorated NiFe LDH nanosheets array anchored on vertically aligned CuO nanowire (CeNiFe@CuO) is fabricated by one‐step electrodeposition strategy, where Ce doping increases the Lewis acidity and crystal imperfection degree of the composite. The CeNiFe@CuO can achieve high current density of 500 mA cm−2 with overpotential of 265 and 280 mV in KOH and alkaline natural seawater, respectively, and remain stable for 300 h at 500 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater without apparent corrosion. Systematic experiments and mechanism analysis confirm that the excellent OER activity can be attributed to the introduction of Ce species, which bring massive oxygen vacancies and accelerate the Ni component oxidation rate. Moreover, the CeNiFe@CuO exhibits enhanced surface OH− adsorption kinetics and capacity, resulting in electrostatic exclusion of Cl− to achieve high OER stability and selectivity. This study provides new insights into the development of efficient corrosion‐resistant electrocatalysts for high‐current seawater electrolysis.",

Herein a theory‐guided prediction approach is presented to construct a rigid–soft coupling SEI, engineered through the strategic regulation of both interfacial and bulk electrochemistry for the design of nitrogen‐ and boron‐coordinated cobalt single atoms within nitrogen‐doped carbon (Co–N₃B/C) anodes. The experimental and theoretical findings reveal that the distinctive Co–N3B configuration tends to generate a local electric field that benefits for fast Na+ transfer kinetics and the decomposition of fluorinated electrolyte, resulting in the formation of a robust inorganic‐rich SEI. Consequently, the dual‐coordinated Co single‐atom electrode design, coupled with the hybrid organic–inorganic SEI, endows the sodium‐ion batteries anode with a high capacity of 230.5 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and exceptional long‐term cycling stability, as evidenced by 97.0% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1.

However, their commercialization has long been hampered by inherent drawbacks, particularly voltage decay and hysteresis, which reduce energy density and efficiency, shorten battery life, and challenge battery management. To address these issues, a prerequisite is establishing a comprehensive understanding of voltage‐related phenomena correlated with anionic redox reactions (ARR), which remains elusive despite extensive research. Therefore, in this review, the proposed mechanisms are systematically summarized and the fundamental origins of voltage decay and hysteresis are identified, together with elucidating their relationship with ARR. Voltage decay is mainly attributed to irreversible TM migration and phase transition, whose driving force involves factors like lattice strain accumulation and oxygen loss. A relatively unified theory, the asymmetric non‐equilibrium reaction path during ARR, is identified as the fundamental origin of voltage hysteresis. This path includes sequential electrochemical reactions and chemical processes (sluggish electronic and atomic structural rearrangements, such as TM migration and ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer). Recent achievements and effective solutions for these voltage issues are also elaborated. After deeply understanding voltage decay and hysteresis, inspiring insights for mitigation strategies and forward‐looking remarks are provided.",

Furthermore, it systematically examines the challenges in photocatalytic urea synthesis and evaluates viable solutions to overcome these limitations.

However, fabricating gel materials with low hysteresis and high toughness remains challenging due to their intrinsic contradictory attributes, particularly in ionic liquid (IL)‐based systems. Herein, a water‐mediated polymer network reorganization strategy is presented for developing tough and low hysteresis ionohydrogels (IHGs) containing ILs, where the synergistic effect between covalent crosslinking and dynamic interfacial lubrication governs their exceptional performance. Water can act as a lubricating mediator to moderately attenuate interactions between ILs and polymer chains, thereby enabling the formation of dynamically adaptive networks that facilitate chain mobility and stress redistribution. Therefore, the IHGs fabricated through water content modulation achieve a well‐balanced combination of high toughness (2.2 MJ m−3) and low hysteresis (8.1% at 400% strain). Meanwhile, the prepared IHGs demonstrate superior comprehensive performance, including high stretchability, excellent tensile strength, superior electrical conductivity, good biocompatibility, and transparency. Finally, the IHGs can function as high‐performance wearable sensors and biocompatible epidermal electrodes, enabling real‐time health monitoring and acquisition of high‐fidelity electrophysiological signals. The simple strategy overcomes the traditional trade‐offs of low hysteresis and high toughness, demonstrating exceptional potential in real‐life scenarios.",

However, how to efficiently generate 1O2 by modulating the asymmetric structure and electron spin state of catalyst remains a challenge. Herein, an asymmetric Fe─S─Co structured catalyst (Co‐Fe3S4) is designed by in situ substitution of FeIIITd strategy. The strong interaction in the asymmetric structure induces a low‐spin state (e: ↑↓, ↑↓, t2: ↑↓, _, _) at d‐orbital of Co sites, shifting the d‐band center closer to the Fermi level and elevating the antibonding states, which is beneficial for the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The catalyst accelerates 1O2 generation by PMS activation, achieving 100% removal of acetaminophen in pharmaceutical wastewater in 8 min with a high K‐value of 112 min⁻¹ M⁻¹. Experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the spin state of the generated *O2 (from the S─O bond cleavage in HSO5−) is reduced by electron reversal (↓ to ↑) or pairing (↑, ↑ to ↑↓, _) in the 2p (2px and 2py) orbitals of the O─O anti‐π bond (π*), resulting in the 1O2 generation.

Nevertheless, Mn‐based RFBs face a critical challenge: the undesired formation of crystalline MnO2 through Mn3+ disproportionation and irreversibility of MnO2 deposits on electrode surfaces severely diminish accessible reaction sites and restrict achievable areal capacity. Herein, it is demonstrated that ligand chelation‐mediated structural transformation of MnO2 by sodium diphosphate (Na4P2O7, PPi) modulates MnO2 deposition behavior. The PPi coordinate with Mn2+ to form a stable [Mn(HPO4)2(H2O)2]2− chelate, which facilitates the incorporation of defective O and P into the evolving MnO2 structure, effectively disrupting its crystallographic ordering and converting MnO2 from crystalline to amorphous configuration. The amorphous MnO2 tends to flow into the electrolyte instead of depositing on the electrode due to the electrostatic interplay, thereby resulting in a breakthrough areal capacity of 91.5 mAh cm−2 (300 cycles @ 99.7% CE) and 141.8 mAh cm−2 (150 cycles @ 98.2% CE, the highest reported values), representing a 10‐fold enhancement compared to additive‐free counterparts.

However, when arranged in large‐scale arrays, their performance is often hindered by challenges such as poor reliability and sneak currents. To address these, Al, N‐doped TaOx (ANTO) memristors are precisely engineered in this study using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The oxygen vacancy (Vo) content in TaOx can be regulated by controlling the dopant concentrations via the number of ALD cycles, thereby effectively adjusting the Schottky barrier height and surface resistance. This optimizes the oxygen ion‐based interface‐type resistive switching while improving the self‐rectifying properties. Furthermore, Vo passivation by N‐doping effectively suppresses sneak currents in crossbar arrays. Optimized devices exhibit endurance exceeding 3.5 × 104 cycles and 3‐bit retention over 103 s. Their long‐term potentiation and depression characteristics are highly accurate in synaptic neural network‐based image recognition tasks. Hardware‐level demonstrations using the fabricated 32 × 32 crossbar array confirm stable analog switching, reliable multibit programming, and effective suppression of sneak‐path currents under practical operating conditions.

Here, a magnetoelectric suture is developed by incorporating core‐shell magnetoelectric nanoparticles within a piezoelectric P(VDF‐TrFE) matrix. Upon external magnetic field exposure, magneto‐mechano‐electric cascade synergistically generated a programmable electrical output, thereby enabling spatiotemporally controlled electrical stimulation at the wound site. The ME suture is engineered with a polyzwitterionic hydrogel skin, imparting them with improved mechanical compliance, biocompatibility, and reduced foreign body response, and enabling friction‐minimized removal. In a rat incisional wound model, the ME suture with daily magnetic induction achieved significantly faster healing by reducing the recovery time from ten days to just five days. This work establishes a paradigm for intelligent suture systems, offering a theranostic platform that synergizes mechanoadaptive properties with electrically augmented tissue repair for next‐generation wound management.",

To address this issue, this work introduced a novel lymphocyte‐mimicking sonosensitizer using Mn‐doped hollow Prussian blue nanoparticle (Mn‐HP) for cancer sonodynamic therapy (SDT) to efficiently evoke anticancer immunity. The prepared Mn‐HP have unique architecture to amplify ultrasonic cavitation effects, boosting spatially controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Through the effective combination of the Mn‐HP and lymphocytes, the Lymphocyte‐mimicking sonosensitizer (Lymphocytes‐Mn‐HP, LM) with the “Homing effect” is constructed. The sequenced dual‐ultrasound strategy employs high‐power ultrasound (2.0 W cm−2) stimulation (excessive ROS) for tumor antigen release and low‐power ultrasound (0.5 W cm−2) stimulation (moderate ROS) for lymph node to active immune cells, enabling precise spatial‐temporal controlled ROS generation while preserving immune function. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated significant tumor suppression through initiating the cancer‐immunity cycle, offering a transformative paradigm for SDT‐immunotherapy integration.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the rapid development of the global photovoltaic industry, regional and environmental differences directly affect the degree of installation of perovskite modules worldwide. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that are suitable for deployment in geographical locations with continuous sunlight exposure are those that are persistently exposed to UV irradiation, which means that the PSCs need to have the ability to resist functional degradation caused by UV irradiation. Based on this, the antioxidant plant pomegranate peel extract, punicalagin is utilized, as a booster for PSCs to resist UV irradiation. The highly hydroxylated structure of punicalagin have strong antioxidant capacity, which largely defends against the strong oxidative atmosphere induced by UV irradiation. In addition, the C═O and C═C groups in punicalagin coordinated with undercoordinated Pb2+, reducing the probability of defect generation during perovskite nucleation and crystallization, improving film quality and corresponding device performance. Based on the positive effect of punicalagin, the photovoltaic parameter indicators of PSCs improved comprehensively, and the power conversion efficiency increased to 24.24%. Furthermore, the perovskite film modified with punicalagin can resist UV irradiation, exhibit excellent oxidation stability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study employs an “electron island” micro‐interface engineering strategy to construct a NiCoP/Mo4P3 heterostructured catalytic system on a FeP substrate via a synergistic hydrothermal synthesis and low‐temperature phosphorization approach. The unique open hierarchical architecture provides atomic‐scale anchoring sites for small‐sized Mo4P3 quantum dots (QDs), forming a high‐density “electron island‐substrate” micro‐interface network, which drastically increases the population of active micro‐interface sites between the two phases. Concurrently, the discretely distributed QDs induce interfacial charge polarization through quantum confinement effects, generating a robust built‐in electric field at the heterointerfaces that drives directional electron migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows the interfacial interaction between NiCoP and Mo4P3 can effectively manipulate the electronic architecture and regulate the H* adsorption energy, further decreasing the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*). FeP@NiCoP/Mo4P3 can make full use of the active sites generated at the interface, to give full play to the catalytic properties of heterogeneous structures, which ensures the significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic efficiency and excellent long‐term stability in alkaline water and complicated seawater environments.

However, the synthesis of short‐chain sulfur composites that simultaneously feature high sulfur content and high conductivity remains a significant challenge. Herein, the facile fabrication of conductive short‐chain sulfur composite with ultra‐high sulfur content (42.5 wt%) for efficient Na/K‐ion storage is reported. The protocol relied only on the industrial pitch and elemental sulfur as precursor via a simple heat treatment at low temperature (e.g. 450 °C). Rich delocalized C═C and C═S bonds are introduced into the carbon skeleton, forming the spatial π‐electron conjugation and spatial sp2‐hybridization, and resulting in a six‐order‐of‐magnitude enhancement of the electronic conductivity compared to the pitch‐derive carbon. The short‐chain sulfur species demonstrate superb reactivity with both Na‐ion and K‐ion without dissoluble polysulfide formation. A surface‐dominated storage mechanism enables outstanding electrode kinetics with diminished electrode deformation. As anodes, this composite delivers extraordinary reversible capacities for both Na‐ion (848 mAh g−1) and K‐ion (699 mAh g−1) storage with superior rate and promising cyclability. Moreover, this anode could even deliver impressive battery performances for K‐ion storage at a high mass loading (10.2 mg cm−2) of the active composite.",

To fully realize the integration functions and simulate the structure of real skin, this work reactivates the “dead leather” back to intelligent E‐skin (Leather/Ag/Polyborosiloxane elastomer) and further develops its application in harsh scenarios. The Ag nanowires/flakes incorporated leather fiber acts as the dermis layer to endow the E‐skin with good electric conductivity, force sensitivity, and electrothermal management. The hierarchical structure allows the incident electromagnetic waves to be reflected and absorbed multiple times, possessing a superior electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding value (≈75 dB). Due to the unique rate‐dependent shear stiffening effects originated from the polyborosiloxane elastomer, the E‐skin achieves significant force buffering capacity (≈47%) and excellent energy dissipation (over 85%). Moreover, the LAP E‐skin exhibits unconventional sensing behavior, including piezoresistive sensing and impact stimulation, allowing for differentiation between low‐energy and high‐energy stimuli. On this basis, an elegant smart vest is successfully developed with exceptional thermal therapy, accurate contact perception, and wireless impact monitoring, demonstrating broad potential in the next generation of wearable protective equipment and smart robotics.",

Here, air‐stable intercalated Co1/3TaS2 single‐crystal nanoflakes are reported, demonstrating two magnetic phase transitions and a potential charge density wave phase transition. Transport measurements confirmed the persistence of non‐coplanar antiferromagnetic order in exfoliated Co1/3TaS2 nanoflakes, characterized by a spontaneous topological Hall effect with rectangular shape and moderate coercive fields. The underlying mechanisms of the two magnetic phase transitions, as well as the anomalous Hall effect resulting from skew scattering observed above the Néel temperature, are investigated. Furthermore, the successful integration of Co1/3TaS2 nanoflake into van der Waals heterostructure underscores the potential for diverse device applications.

Zn‐Salen‐MCOF with kgd‐v topology shows a higher H2O2 photocatalytic production rate of 6617/3438 µmol gcat.−1 h−1 in pure water with/without additional O2 or air saturation, together with long‐time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance (100 h). The framework isomerism effect and the chelated linkages contribute to the improved H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency and stability of it. A three‐step 2e⁻ WOR with the initial H2O adsorption over the ZnO2N2 unit and a four‐step 2e⁻ ORR reaction mechanism with the key Had adsorption at the pyrazinic N site are proposed.

In this study, heat‐responsive nB‐OMVs are developed by loading n‐butanol into OMVs (nB‐OMVs). Upon heating, the decreased solubility of n‐butanol triggered phase separation within the vesicles, resulting in enhanced ultrasound signals, including fundamental, harmonic, and subharmonic components. Experimental results demonstrated that nB‐OMVs retained the native morphology of OMVs, along with their tumor‐targeting accumulation and tumor growth inhibition capabilities. nB‐OMVs injection induces red blood cell extravasation into tumors, under near‐infrared (NIR) irradiation, these extravasated RBCs acted as photothermal mediators, generating a localized thermal environment that activated intratumoral nB‐OMVs and further amplified the ultrasound signal. In B‐mode and contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging, tumor grayscale intensities increased by 4.6‐ and 8.5‐fold, respectively. This work provides a promising strategy for ultrasound‐based tumor imaging using extracellular vesicles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Supramolecular polymers, bonded through directional non-covalent interactions, closely mimic dynamic behaviors of biological nanofibers. However, the complexity of assembly pathways makes it highly challenging to unravel the nature of supramolecular dynamics in aqueous environments. Here we introduce a precise combinatorial titration methodology to probe in situ the assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PAs). This approach reveals a binary assembly mechanism governed by equilibrium between spheroidal micelles and β-sheet polymers. Weakening hydrogen bonding shifts the equilibrium towards micelles and decreases the internal structural order of filamentous polymers, promoting supramolecular dynamics. Extending this methodology to two-component copolymerization systems, we find a surprising tendency to form blocky nanostructures with reduced internal phase separation as the mismatch in peptide sequence decreases. Interestingly, while well-mixed copolymers acquire different dynamics, mismatched ones retain the characteristic supramolecular motion of their homopolymer counterparts. These critical insights into supramolecular dynamics offer strategies to tailor the dynamic functions of supramolecular nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The Wingless/Int-1 (WNT) signaling network is essential to orchestrate central physiological processes such as embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. In the currently held tenet, WNT/β-catenin signaling is initiated by WNT-induced recruitment of Frizzleds (FZDs) and LRP5/6 followed by the formation of a multiprotein signalosome complex. Here, we use bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to show that different WNT paralogs dynamically trigger FZD-LRP6 association. While WNT-induced receptor interaction was independent of C-terminal LRP6 phosphorylation, it was allosterically modulated by binding of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL) to FZD. WNT-16B emerged as a ligand of particular interest, as it efficiently promoted FZD-LRP6 association but, unlike WNT-3A, did not lead to WNT/β-catenin signaling. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed distinct transcriptional fingerprints of WNT-3A and WNT-16B stimulation in HEK293 cells. Additionally, single-molecule tracking demonstrated that, despite increasing FZD5 and LRP6 confinement, WNT-16B stimulation did not result in formation of higher-order receptor clusters, in contrast to WNT-3A. Our results suggest that FZD-WNT-LRP5/6 complex formation alone is not sufficient for the initiation of WNT/β-catenin signaling. Instead, we propose a two-step model, where initial ligand-induced FZD-LRP6 association must be followed by receptor clustering into higher-order complexes and subsequent phosphorylation of LRP6 for efficient activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling.",

So far, most of the reported work is conducted on metal substrates and relies on unconventional mechanisms, thereby precluding a direct transposition of well-established organic reactions from solutions to surfaces. In addition, the intrinsic properties and reactivity of metal substrates often limit the activation methods available to trigger on-surface reactions, and photoinduced processes are especially difficult to handle due to quenching of the adsorbed precursor molecules. Herein, the photoinduced deoxygenation of dibenzothiophene S-oxide (DBTO) derivatives is transposed from solutions to insulating alkali halide surfaces in ultra-high vacuum. By combining in-solution and on-surface investigations by means of scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, as well as bias spectroscopy measurements, we provide evidence of the successful on-surface deoxygenation of individual DBTO derivatives under UV irradiation. The photoinduced deoxygenation is conducted at low temperature (",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.",

Central to GCE is the development of orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs wherein engineered aaRSs recognize chosen ncAAs and charge them onto tRNAs that decode blank codons (e.g., the amber stop codon). However, evolving new aaRS/tRNA pairs traditionally relies on a labor-intensive process that often yields aaRSs with suboptimal ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Here, we present an OrthoRep-mediated strategy for aaRS evolution, which we demonstrate in 8 independent aaRS evolution campaigns, yielding multiple aaRSs that incorporate an overall range of 13 ncAAs tested. Some evolved systems enable ncAA-dependent translation at single amber codons with similar efficiency as natural translation at sense codons. Additionally, we discover an aaRS that regulated its own expression to enhance ncAA dependency. These findings demonstrate the potential of OrthoRep-driven aaRS evolution platforms to advance the field of GCE.",

We hypothesize that CXCR2 in epithelial and endothelial cells contributes to neutrophil recruitment into the lung by modifying the availability of its cognate chemokines in lung alveoli. Using conditional endothelial and epithelial CXCR2 knockout mice, we demonstrate that selective CXCR2 deletion in either compartment impairs neutrophil recruitment into the lung during bacterial pneumonia and reduces bacterial clearance. We show that CXCR2 ablation in epithelial and endothelial cells compromises respective trans-epithelial and trans-endothelial transcytosis of alveolar CXCL1. Mechanistically, CXCR2-mediated CXCL1 endothelial and epithelial cell transcytosis requires the function of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase in these cells. In conclusion, CXCR2 plays an important role in alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells, where it mediates cognate chemokine transcytosis, thus actively supporting their activities in neutrophil recruitment to the infected lungs.",

They have been studied for decades and are nowadays considered as invaluable biotechnology tools used as biopesticides, recombinant expression systems or delivery vehicle for gene therapy. However, little is known about the baculovirus nucleocapsid assembly at a molecular level. Here, we solve the whole structure of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) nucleocapsid by applying cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) combined with de novo modelling and Alphafold predictions. Our structure completes prior observations and elucidates the intricate architecture of the apical cap, unravelling the organization of a DNA portal featuring intriguing symmetry mismatches between its core and vertex. The core, closing the capsid at the apex, holds two DNA helices of the viral genome tethered to Ac54 proteins. Different symmetry components at the apical cap and basal structure are constituted of the same building block, made of Ac101/Ac144, proving the versatility of this modular pair. The crown forming the portal vertex displays a C21 symmetry and contains, amongst others, the motor-like protein Ac66. Our findings support the viral portal to be involved in DNA packaging, probably in conjunction with other parts of a larger DNA packaging apparatus.",

However, whether they act solely as docking platforms or actively promote the co-orientation of SAC catalysts such as MAD1:MAD2 and BUB1:BUB3 remains unresolved. Here, we reconstitute kinetochores and SAC signaling in vitro to address this question. We engineer recombinant kinetochore particles that recruit core SAC components and trigger checkpoint signaling upon Rapamycin induction, and test their function using a panel of targeted mutants. At approximately physiological concentrations of SAC proteins, kinetochores are essential for efficient mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) assembly, the key effector of SAC signaling. Our results suggest that kinetochores serve not only as structural hubs but also as catalytic platforms that concentrate and spatially organize SAC components to accelerate MCC formation and ensure timely checkpoint activation.",

Herein, we monitor the life and death of carbon nitride supports for Pt single atoms in acetylene hydrochlorination, demonstrating that specific N-functionalities and their restructuring cause distinct deactivation mechanisms. Varying polymerization and exfoliation degrees in pristine carbon nitrides (i.e., −NH\n              x\n             termination and N-vacancy concentrations), we establish graphitic and pyridinic N-atoms as C2H2 adsorption sites and pyridinic N-vacancies as coking sites through kinetic and spectroscopic analyses. Uniquely suited for probing point defects, operando electron paramagnetic spectroscopy, coupled to simulations, reveals that HCl drives depolymerization, by protonating heptazine-linking graphitic N-atoms, and generates graphitic N-vacancies, forming NH3. These reduce C2H2 adsorption and promote radical polymerization into coke, respectively, without altering Pt atoms.

Cholinergic transmission to the muscle fiber triggers action potentials, which are sensed by voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (CaV1.1). In turn, the conformational changes in CaV1.1 propagate to and activate intracellular ryanodine receptors (RyR1), causing Ca2+ release and contraction. The CaV1.1 channel has four voltage-sensing domains (VSD-I to -IV) with diverse voltage-sensing properties, so the identity of VSD(s) responsible for conferring voltage dependence to RyR1 opening, is unknown. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry, we show that only VSD-III possesses kinetic, voltage-dependent and pharmacological properties consistent with skeletal-muscle excitability and Ca2+ release. We propose that the earliest voltage-dependent event in the excitation-contraction process is the structural rearrangement of VSD-III that propagates to RyR1 to initiate Ca2+ release and contraction.",

However, the effect of ruxolitinib on JAK2-V617F allelic burden is modest, suggesting that inhibition of JAK2-V617F signaling-driven clone expansion is not the main mechanism of action. We evaluate whether ruxolitinib mainly blocks the proliferation of the malignant clone or exerts its effects also by targeting non-malignant cells. Therefore, we develop two JAK2-V617F-driven myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) mouse models harboring ruxolitinib resistance mutations. Mice carrying ruxolitinib-resistant JAK2-V617F-driven MPN respond to ruxolitinib treatment similar to mice with ruxolitinib-sensitive JAK2-V617F MPN with respect to reduction of spleen size, leukocyte count and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum. Ruxolitinib reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both stromal cells and non-malignant hematopoietic cells. Using a rigorous ruxolitinib resistance mutation approach, we can prove that ruxolitinib acts independent of oncogenic JAK2-V617F signaling and reduces the main features of MPN disease such as spleen size and leukocyte counts. Our findings characterize the mechanism of action for ruxolitinib in MPN.",

Although C. ulcerans is found in multiple domestic and wild animal species, most human cases are linked with pets. Our ability to decipher cross-host species transmission dynamics and to understand the emergence of clinically relevant clones (e.g., diphtheria toxin-positive) is currently hampered by a limited knowledge of C. ulcerans strain diversity and genome evolution. Here, we explore the genomic population structure and evolution of C. ulcerans with 582 isolates from diverse hosts and geographical locations. A newly developed core genome genotyping scheme captures the population structure of C. ulcerans both at deep and shallow phylogenetic levels, uncovering its main sublineages and offering high strain subtyping resolution for epidemiological surveillance. Additionally, we reveal the diversity and distribution of the diphtheria toxin gene (tox), and those of its associated mobile elements. Considering the entire Corynebacterium diphtheriae Species Complex, we find four diphtheria toxin families, five tox-prophage families, and a novel tox-carrying genetic element. We show that some toxin families are shared across Corynebacterium species, revealing tox-prophage cross-species transfer. Our work enhances knowledge on the ecology and evolution of C. ulcerans and provides a genomic framework for tracking the dissemination of emerging sublineages.",

Although exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1 to 2 micrometers, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons enables extended transport lengths and offers opportunities to use photonic mode engineering for tailored transport. Conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons, however, are challenging to tune and integrate into photonic circuits. We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration. We achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in transport length compared to bare excitons and reveal transport dependence on polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which are controlled via photonic crystal design and pump intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These findings establish 2D photonic crystal polaritons as a versatile platform for advancing photonic energy transport technologies.",

However, the neural mechanisms governing action repetition and switching remain largely unknown. In mice trained to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we found that the M1-DLS circuit regulates action repetition, while the PrL-DMS pathway controls action switching. These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1-SPNs by M1 and D2-SPNs by PrL, respectively. In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD, the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL-DMS pathway was reversed, leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors. Genetic restoration of Shank3 in the DMS rescued both physiological and behavioral deficits. These findings reveal how the brain orchestrates action sequencing in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress exposure is a primary contributor to the development of anxiety disorders, closely associated with hippocampal dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr\n            607\n            site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS. Overall, our study reveals a previously undescribed anxiogenic effect of Rap1 and highlights it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stress-related mental disorders.",

However, direct broadband photodetection of high-intensity pulsed lasers, with precisely capturing their spatiotemporal properties, has been hampered by low saturation intensity or damage threshold of traditional optoelectronic materials. Here, we demonstrate that strategic enhancement of excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskite can enable robust high-order multiphoton absorption (MPA) optoelectronics with achieving strong four-photon absorption (4PA) and five-photon absorption (5PA) nonlinearities as well as efficient electronic properties simultaneously. This effectively overcomes the limitations of mainstream photodetectors. Our approach facilitates direct photodetection and high-precision imaging of high-intensity femtosecond lasers (21.5 GW/cm\n            2\n            ) across a broad wavelength range of 800 to 2300 nanometer.

Notably, macrophage hitchhiking delivery of β-elemene–loaded GeSNSs not only achieves high accumulation in tumor regions and suppresses tumor growth under ultrasound treatment, but also effectively remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by improving M1-like macrophage polarization and enhancing the populations of mature dendritic cells, CD4\n            +\n            , and CD8\n            +\n            lymphocytes, thereby facilitating enhanced sonodynamic chemoimmunotherapy.

Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects.

    "abstract": "Slab subduction transports carbonates into the reduced, metallic iron (Fe\n            0\n            )–bearing sublithospheric mantle (>250 kilometers), leading to heterogeneous mantle redox states and sublithospheric diamond formation beneath cratons. To elucidate the drivers of mantle redox variation, we performed mixed reaction experiments between carbonatite melt and Fe\n            0\n            -bearing peridotite at 9 to 21 gigapascals under varying redox conditions. Comparing our results with sublithospheric diamond inclusions, we find that majorite and ferropericlase inclusions from the Amazonia Craton reflect a predominantly reduced, nonplume mantle environment, while majorites from the Kaapvaal Craton indicate a fully oxidized plume setting. In nonplume environments, carbonatite melts are progressively consumed until fully frozen as reduced carbon. Attachment of these materials to the cratonic keel further enhances craton stability. In plume environments, carbonatite melts surpass the redox buffering capacity of Fe\n            0\n            , leading to an oxidized, CO\n            2\n            -rich melt-bearing mantle. Impregnation of these melts into the lithosphere weakens the cratonic keel, resulting in lithosphere delamination, surface uplift, and widespread volcanism.",

While most WM research has centered on the mechanisms of objects, there has been a lack of investigation into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of events, which are the building blocks of our experience. Using confirmatory factor analysis, psychophysical experiments, and resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, our study demonstrated that events have an independent storage space within WM, named as event cache, with distinct neural correlates compared to object storage in WM. We found the cerebellar network to be the most essential network for event cache, with the left cerebellum Crus I being particularly involved in encoding and maintaining events. Our findings shed critical light on the neuropsychological mechanism of WM by revealing event cache as an independent component of WM and encourage the reconsideration of theoretical models for WM.",

The ability to fabricate and sculpt glass at the nanoscale would naturally expand its application domain in nanophotonics. Here, we report an approach to print glass in three dimensions with nanoscale resolutions. We developed Glass-Nano, an organic-inorganic hybrid resin containing silicon elements. Using this high-resolution resin, three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals (PhCs) were printed with two-photon lithography. After printing, the structures were heated to high temperatures in air to remove organic components and convert the remaining material into silica glass. 3D glass PhCs with periodicities as small as 260 nanometers were obtained after sintering at 650°C. The 3D glass PhCs exhibit ~100% reflectance in the visible range, surpassing the typical reflectances observed from similar structures in low–refractive index materials. The quality of PhCs achieved is observed in both electron microscopy and the excellent agreement with band structure calculations of idealized structures.",

Variant polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are “writers” of ubiquitylation on histone H2A K118 and K119, crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.",

Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples, we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co-occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions. The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans, where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation. Conversely, in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans, plankton showed enrichment in non-phosphorus lipids, likely responding to warm temperature, with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump. In the subsurface of these regions, highly unsaturated lipids were enriched, suggesting phytoplankton adaptation to low light and contributing unsaturated fatty acids to tropical and subtropical ocean food webs.",

The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional.

    "abstract": "β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP)–cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for amyloid-β (Aβ) generation and is considered promising drug target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The co-chaperone BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene 3) plays an important role in maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis by regulating heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Here, we reported that BAG3 expression was significantly elevated in AD. It interacted with and stabilized BACE1 by delaying its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal pathways. BAG3\n            E455K\n            and BAG3\n            R480A\n            mutations reduced their interaction with BACE1. SPOT peptide arrays revealed that BACE1 carboxyl-terminal peptide fragments bound to the RQ domain of BAG3. This interaction can be disrupted by BACE1-derived peptide (Tat-BACE1\n            480-494\n            ), leading to decreased BACE1 stability. In APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, Tat-BACE1\n            480-494\n            reduced BACE1 levels, decreased Aβ production, and improved synaptic and cognitive deficits. These findings indicate that BAG3 forms complex with HSP70 and BACE1 to stabilize BACE1, suggesting that Tat-BACE1\n            480-494\n            , may represent an ideal class of neuroprotective therapeutics against AD.",

    "abstract": "The global clean energy transition requires the development of alternative energy technologies that rely on critical raw materials including lithium. Closed-basin brines, which generate ~40% of global lithium production, often have a circumneutral pH; however, during the evaporative concentration required for lithium production, the evaporated brines become acidic. Using primary geochemical and boron isotope data from the Salar de Uyuni (SDU), Bolivia combined with a modeling approach, we show that boron enrichment, which commonly co-occurs with lithium in closed-basin brines, is the primary factor in controlling the pH of brines from the SDU. We demonstrate that boron in global lithium- and boron-rich brines from closed basins exerts a similar influence on brine pH. The unique boron enrichments and its speciation can explain large proportions of alkalinity in these brines (~98% at the SDU), where evaporation alters the dissociation of boric acid, which triggers the formation of acidic evaporated brines.",

However, the extent to which TCs affect infant survival in LMICs is not well understood. We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries’ children fare better after TC exposure than others.",

However, it is not yet understood how lightning produces an enormous number of relativistic electrons in dense atmospheres. We present that, thanks to a ground-based observation with optical, radio frequency and high-energy measurements focused on television transmission towers in Kanazawa, Japan, a TGF and a cloud-to-ground discharge of −56 kA occurred when a downward negative leader was colliding with an upward positive leader from the tower. Because the cloud-to-ground current followed the TGF by 30 μs, the TGF started when two leaders approached each other. Our results indicate that an immense number of electrons were produced and accelerated to relativistic energies in a strong and compact electric-field region between the two leaders.",

We analyzed data from mice performing a visual go/no-go change-detection task where the sequence of stimulus presentations was intermittently interrupted by omission of a stimulus. The omission of a visual stimulus did not elicit discernable spiking responses in visual cortical neurons. Instead, firing rates between image presentations, including the omission period, ramped linearly and without interruption at the time of the omitted image. Several neuron types in visual cortex neurons were identified with various responses to images and their omissions. A minority of cells in nonvisual areas, including the hippocampus, increased their firing rates at the omitted stimulus onset even when these neurons did not respond to the images. Our study elucidates the origin of omission responses in the visual cortex and sheds light on the role of hippocampal and subcortical circuits in omission detection.",

    "abstract": "Vanadium oxides (VOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous batteries due to their high theoretical capacity, but they face challenges such as sluggish kinetics and V dissolution. To overcome these issues, we introduce a universal alcohol-based molecule coupling (AMC) method to regulate amorphousness and inhibit V dissolution in VOs (VO\n            2\n            , V\n            2\n            O\n            5\n            , and V\n            6\n            O\n            13\n            ), resulting in high-performance cathodes. The strategy enables alcohol molecules with different chain lengths (ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol) to couple with VOs by forming V─OH bonds under Lewis acid–based interactions, inducing controlled amorphization. Among these, isopropanol coupling stands out by enabling the formation of short-range ordered amorphous structure (SOA-VO/Ipr). This structure enhances the reaction kinetics and suppresses V dissolution. As a result, the SOA-VO/Ipr cathode achieves 219.4 mAh g\n            −1\n            at 100 A g\n            −1\n            , retains 92.6% capacity over 10,000 cycles, and delivers 228.8 mAh g\n            −1\n            at 9.1 A g\n            −1\n            under high loading (21.9 mg cm\n            −2\n            ) over 3500 cycles, demonstrating a promising method for durable zinc-ion batteries.",

Using aerosol mass spectrometry over multiple years in LA illustrates the controlling dynamics of AN and their evolution over the past decades. These data suggest that much of the nitric acid (HNO\n            3\n            ) production required to produce AN in LA occurs during the nighttime via heterogeneous hydrolysis of N\n            2\n            O\n            5\n            .

We evaluated methods for assessing therapeutic response using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma from patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the CheckPAC trial (NCT02866383). Patients were evaluated before and after initiation of therapy using tumor-informed plasma whole-genome sequencing (WGMAF) and tumor-independent genome-wide cfDNA fragmentation profiles and repeat landscapes (ARTEMIS-DELFI). Using WGMAF, molecular responders had a median overall survival (OS) of 319 days compared to 126 days for nonresponders [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.11–0.79,\n            P\n             = 0.011].

Among these, we found that the scaffolding proteins SCRIB and PSD93 are highly enriched at the AIS. Using CRISPR-mediated knockout, cell surface clustering assays, and coimmunoprecipitation, we show that SCRIB and PSD93 bind to and are required for AIS Kv1 channel clustering, whereas SCRIB links the AIS Kv1 channel protein complex to the master AIS scaffolding protein AnkyrinG. These results define a hierarchy of scaffolding proteins that combine to cluster AIS Kv1 channels.",

We note higher IRRs for severe outcomes for all non-white relative to white ethnicities. The magnitude of IRRs for both deprivation and ethnicities declined from the wild-type to the omicron periods for severe outcomes. For infections, we observed IRRs above one for non-white ethnicities during the wild-type and alpha periods. Vaccination significantly reduced risks across all groups. For severe outcomes, preexisting health inequalities led to large and persistent disparities. For infections, measures must be structured with ethnicity and deprivation in mind early in a pandemic.",

We characterized nasal airway epithelial cell (NAEC) developmental phenotypes from children aged 2 to 3 years in an a priori designed nested birth cohort from four mutually exclusive groups of wheezers/nonwheezers and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)–infected/uninfected in the first year of life. NAECs were differentiated, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro RSV infection. Gene expression of NAECs from children with a wheeze phenotype indicated abnormal differentiation and basal cell activation of developmental pathways, plasticity in precursor differentiation, delayed onset of maturation, increased diversity of RSV receptors, and blunted antiviral immune responses to in vitro RSV infection. The most marked changes in differentiation were observed in NAECs from children with both wheeze and RSV in the first year of life. Together, this suggests that airway epithelium in children with wheeze is developmentally reprogrammed and characterized by increased barrier permeability, decreased antiviral response, and altered RSV receptor expression.",

Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of cyclin D1–bound AMBRA1-DDB1 complex at 3.55-Å resolution. The structure reveals a substrate interaction surface on the AMBRA1 WD40 domain that specifically binds to the C-terminal region of D-type cyclins. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr\n            286\n            residue in the C-terminal phosphodegron site of D-type cyclins. The phosphodegron motif folds into a turn-like conformation, followed by a 3\n            10\n            helix that promotes its assembly with AMBRA1. In addition, we show that AMBRA1 mutants, which are defective in cyclin D1 binding, lead to cyclin D1 accumulation and DNA damage. Understanding the AMBRA1–D-type cyclin structure enhances the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern the cell cycle control and may lead to potential therapeutic approaches for cancers linked to abnormal cyclin D activity.",

This study investigates the effects of laser peak power and ENZ mode excitation on hot electron relaxation in TCOs. Our experimental analysis theoretically supported by a hydrodynamic model reveals that increasing laser pulse intensity extends hot electron relaxation time by more than 200%, while ENZ mode excitation increases it by more than 40% in representative TCO ENZ materials. This research demonstrates the controllable modulation of ultrafast ENZ nonlinearity via pulse peak power and ENZ mode field enhancement. These findings provide substantial insights into the potential utilization of ENZ nonlinearity for the development of optical and quantum computing components, including ultrafast optical switches, dynamic pulse shapers, and modulators.",

Specifically, FER spectroscopy reveals charge transfer and electronic states that strongly differ from the decoupled borophene phases observed on silver, suggesting that the deposition of boron on copper results in strong covalent bonding characteristic of a 2D copper boride.

However, there have been no self-consistent models that quantify whether this process can generate the required field intensities. Our impact and magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that for an initial maximum surface field of only 2 microtesla, plasmas created from basin-forming impacts can amplify a planetary dipole field at the basin antipode to ~43 microtesla.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Oxidative addition most commonly involves the addition of a substrate to a metal centre. This reaction is fundamental across synthetic chemistry and underpins numerous catalytic methods. In the textbook description of oxidative addition reactions, a net increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal occurs with simultaneous bond breaking at the substrate. The majority of known oxidative addition reactions, however, involve substrates bearing relatively electronegative elements (for example, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and halogens) and there has been little discussion of how addition processes may fundamentally change if substrates were constructed from more electropositive elements. Here we show that the zinc–zinc bonded complex, Cp*ZnZnCp* (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), which is isoelectronic with dihydrogen, undergoes facile addition to the metal (or semi-metal) centres of a series of main group carbene analogues based on silicon, aluminium, gallium or indium. Reactions proceed with complete breaking of the zinc–zinc bond and an increase in the coordination number of the central metal from two to four. Our analysis suggests that these addition processes are not oxidative, but rather there is likely a continuum of redox outcomes spanning oxidative, redox neutral and reductive. The addition of Cp*ZnZnCp* to silicon(II) provides the most compelling case for a prototypical reductive addition process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Nitrogen atoms are integral components of various chemical functional groups, including amines, amides and N-heterocycles, among others. Consequently, they play an important role in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, materials and commodity chemicals. The formation of C–N bonds is reliably achieved through methods, such as reductive amination, N-alkylation and cross-coupling. Hydroamination, starting with alkenes, presents a valuable alternative for accessing organic compounds containing nitrogen, as alkenes are highly abundant. Here we present a method for the iron-catalysed radical hydroamidation of alkenes. To this end, we developed a radical amidation reagent that can be readily prepared on a large scale, facilitating the efficient transfer of the synthetically valuable cyanamide functionality across both activated and unactivated double bonds. The scope of the reaction is remarkably broad, demonstrating its applicability to the diastereoselective hydroamidation of complex terpene natural products. Importantly, the synthesis of 15N-labelled amines is possible using this strategy. Subsequent chemistry, converting the distinctive cyanamide functionality into other useful groups, further validates the value of the developed methodology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The accurate prediction of reaction performance based on empirical knowledge paves the way to efficient molecule design. Compared with the human-summarized reaction knowledge of a focal dataset, the machine-learned quantitative structure–performance relationship of larger-scale datasets is more effective at accessing the entire chemical space. Here we report a multitask learning workflow combined with a mechanism-informed graph neural network to predict site selectivity for ruthenium-catalysed C–H functionalization of arenes. The multitask architecture enables the acquisition of related knowledge from the simultaneous learning tasks. The embedded reaction graph bridges the gap between previous mechanistic studies and reaction representation. Along with this mechanistic embedding, the developed multitask model demonstrates excellent interpolative and extrapolative ability on the reported dataset composed of 256 reactions, achieving an average site-selectivity prediction accuracy of 0.934 with a standard deviation of 0.007. The prediction scope ranges from simple to fused arenes and was even extended to heterocyclic indole derivatives in the additional out of sample tests containing 14 unseen instances. Furthermore, interpretation of the model promotes the development of a para-selective mechanistic model verified by density functional theory calculations.",

    "abstract": "Corrosion is a challenge for the conservation of musical instruments when metal parts are exposed to organic materials of the instrument's body. In long‐term observations in the Norwegian Museum of Music, Ringve and Rockheim (Museums of Southern Trøndelag), local contact corrosion is documented on metal strings of plucked instruments when mounted close to cellulose nitrate (CN). The investigated strings are iron‐based alloys, in some cases covered with a tin coating. In the gas mixture emitted from CN, the presence of corrosive compounds, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carboxylic acids, is confirmed by an electrochemical NO2‐sensor and gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry. The corrosion product on the strings consists of iron oxide nitrate hydroxide hydrate, Fe2(NO3)O(OH)3(H2O), and goethite, α‐FeOOH, detected with X‐ray diffraction, Raman, and infrared spectroscopy. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, used to investigate the surface of tin‐coated corrosion products, showed the presence of adsorbed organic nitrogen. The formation of corrosion products is dominated by organic acids and moisture. The presence of nitrate in the corrosion product proves the involvement of nitrogen oxides in the corrosion mechanism. This analytical study highlights a dilemma for preserving material combinations in musical instruments and provides a basis for further research in conservation practice.",

However, existing catalytic systems often require harsh conditions or suffer from overoxidation issues, limiting their practical applicability. Herein, a highly efficient and selective catalytic system is reported for benzylic C─H oxidation of alkyl aromatics under exceptionally mild conditions, employing a synergistic combination of trivalent cobalt acetylacetonate [Co(acac)3] and N‐hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) in neutral media. This catalytic protocol achieves outstanding ketone yields up to 99% with >99% selectivity at 70 °C under atmospheric oxygen pressure. The system demonstrates remarkable substrate scope tolerance, accommodating various functional groups while maintaining excellent efficiency (up to 99% conversion and selectivity). Notably, the methodology has been successfully scaled to multigram production of acetophenone without compromising yield and selectivity. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including 18O2 isotopic labeling experiment, unequivocally establish a two‐step reaction pathway proceeding through a 1‐phenylethanol intermediate. This work provides significant advances in sustainable oxidation catalysis by combining operational simplicity with exceptional selectivity under mild conditions, offering promising potential for industrial implementation.",

In view of the simple structure and reactivity toward thiols, the DQ ring has the possibility to become a unique electrophile toward cysteine (Cys) for use in biochemical research. Herein, this possibility is investigated by evaluating the reactivity of a simple DQ salt toward amino acids and Cys‐containing peptides in neutral aqueous media. The results show that the DQ salt selectively forms adducts with free Cys and Cys residues in peptides. It is also demonstrated that the DQ salt effectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase, which contains a Cys residue in its active center. These results indicate that the DQ ring could serve as a new reactive group capable of Cys modification for biochemical and pharmaceutical applications.",

Since the 1970s, street art has become an influential cultural movement with significant artistic and social impact in modern cities, and the conservation of relevant artworks related to urban neo‐muralism has been increasingly recognized. Understanding these materials is critical to developing conservation strategies, as their composition continues to change with industrial innovation and regulatory changes. This study presents the application of an analytical approach that integrates chemical mapping based on spectroscopic approaches together with analytical pyrolysis, chromatography, and mass spectrometry to investigate two key case studies and provide insights into the evolution of street art materials over the past 30 years. This comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of the composition and transformation of urban art materials over time, overcoming the limitations of individual methods and revealing both organic and inorganic materials. This combined approach represents the state of the art in the study of synthetic paints used in modern art and provides new insights into the evolution of the formulation of materials used by street artists.",

At present, the degradation of lead‐based materials due to ion migration phenomenon and the long‐term instability of the prepared devices are still important problems that hinder their practical application. Herein, KI is incorporated into the BA2MA3Pb4I13 polycrystalline detector fabricated via the lamination method. The introduction of KI enhances both the crystallization quality and charge carrier transport capability of the perovskite polycrystalline film. By introducing K+ ions into the interstitial site of perovskite, the effective channel for ion migration is reduced, leading to increased ion activation energy, and then the ion migration in perovskite is effectively inhibited. Consequently, the prepared X‐ray detector exhibits improved stability, with a sensitivity of 6250 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 19.7 nGyair s−1. This study broadens the idea of enhancing the stability of perovskite and lays a research foundation for its practical application.",

The cords, along with cords from four other royal documents of the same period, show considerable deterioration due to age and material components. The analysis employed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS) and high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC‐UV‐Vis‐ESI MS/MS) to examine the inorganic mordants and organic dyes. The results revealed ellagitannin dyes in the black cords and lac and madder dye markers in one red cord. Some soluble redwoods (likely pernambuco, also known as brazilwood) were detected in the others, either on their own or mixed with weld. The preservation state varied among cords, correlating with the mordants; iron predominated in the black and red threads of Łaski’s Statute, contributing to their degradation, whereas the white cord exhibited higher sulfur content. In‐situ sampling using papers soaked with bathophenanthroline (Bphen) allowed detection of major elements in the fibers. These findings are vital for guiding future conservation practices and mitigating risks in cleaning and restoring these delicate materials.",

Microsamples of four polychrome wooden sculptures from the 16th‐17th centuries are examined. Posnjakite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·H2O) and malachite (Cu2(CO3)(OH)2) are most frequently detected by X‐ray powder microdiffraction. In rock samples from the mine site, brochantite (Cu4SO4(OH)6) and malachite are dominant, and in recent precipitates, only langite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·2H2O) is detected, remained in contact with leaking water. In the laboratory, the pigment is prepared by gradually enriching the starting CuSO4·5H2O solution with NaHCO3 in two series of experiments. The initial concentration of the reactants reflected the ratio of Cu2+: HCO3− = 1:1 found in the mine waters at the site, from which langite crystallizes. However, langite does not formed, while brochantite gradually transformed into posnjakite and subsequently malachite. The co‐occurrence of basic copper sulfates and carbonates and the characteristic grain morphology proved to be the main indicators of the pigment in artworks.",

This study is the first to focus on both the stability and thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of biomass‐derived carbon nanosphere (CNS)‐based NFs. It enhances NF stability by utilizing CNSs synthesized from eight biowaste sources, each exhibiting varying dispersion capabilities (zeta potential, ZP values) ranging from ‐17 mV to ‐45.6 mV. For the first time, this research investigates how the ZP of biomass‐derived CNSs influences the TC and dynamic viscosity (V) of biomass‐based NFs. The NFs demonstrated high stability without the need for surfactants, achieving up to 111.8% enhancement in TC with high stability up to 40 days.  The influence of CNS concentration (0.01‐ 0,1 wt%) on TC was studied, revealing optimal enhancement at 0.1 wt%. The effect of ZP on thermal diffusivity is also studied. This work bridges the gap between research and industry, offering significant potential in the automotive sector. It provides a practical guide for future researchers to enhance their understanding of high‐efficiency coolants. Furthermore, this study aligns with seven Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing a cost‐effective waste‐to‐wealth approach that promotes sustainability and innovation.",

Advancements in production techniques have markedly enhanced bioglycerol potential applications across various sectors, including as cosolvent in industrial formulations. In the context of eco‐sustainable formulation design, this study addresses the self‐aggregation of rhamnolipids, biosurfactants with a wide range of physico‐chemical and biological activities, in bioglycerol aqueous mixtures, studied by integrating surface tension and NMR self‐diffusion measurements. Preliminary analysis of the properties of water‐bioglycerol mixtures indicates that bioglycerol impurities (mainly potassium acetate) have only a small effect on surface tension and no discernible effect on bulk properties such as density, viscosity and refractive index. The aggregation of rhamnolipids is unaffected by bioglycerol at concentrations up to 40‐50 wt%. At higher cosolvent levels, the cmc increases and the micelle dimension micellar size decreases, an indirect effect of the decreasing polarity of the medium. These results provide the basic knowledge to promote the exploration of rhamnolipids and bioglycerol as valuable ingredients in formulations for various applications.",

The research focuses on testing a column‐type bioelectrochemical reactor to stimulate in‐situ degradation of contaminants through the supply of electrons by a graphite granules biocathode. After a preliminary laboratory characterization and operation with a synthetic feeding solution, a field test was conducted in a real contaminated site, where the reactor demonstrated effective degradation of CAHs and inorganic anions. Notably, the cathodic potential promoted the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated species. Simultaneously, nitrate reduction, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis occurred, influencing the overall coulombic efficiency of the process. The use of real groundwater, compared to the synthetic medium, significantly decreased the coulombic efficiency of reductive dechlorination, dropping from 2.43% to 0.01%. Concentration profiles along the bioelectrochemical reactor allowed for a deeper description of the reductive dechlorination rate at different flow rates as well as increased knowledge about reduction and oxidation mechanisms. Scaling up the technology presents several challenges, including the optimization of coulombic efficiency and the management of competing microbial metabolisms.

This study reports the design and synthesis of dopant‐free pyrazine‐based HTMs. PS1 features a D–A–D type structure with pyrazine as the acceptor and 4,4′‐dimethoxy triphenylamine (4,4′‐OMe‐TPA) as the donor, while PS2 adopts a D–π–A–π–D configuration with an additional thiophene unit as π‐spacer along with 4,4′‐OMe‐TPA as donor. Both compounds are synthesized through a simple two‐step synthetic procedure. These HTMs are subjected to structural, photophysical, electrochemical, theoretical, and photoelectrochemical studies with an emphasis on evaluation of structure–property relationships. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the electronic distribution, optimized molecular structure, and frontier molecular orbitals. Their performance in PVSCs is systematically evaluated without adding dopants. PS2 exhibits superior photoluminescence quenching compared to PS1, indicating more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite layer. Notably, PS2 achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%, surpassing the performance of PS1 (PCE of 10.15%). These findings highlight the potential of adjusting the electron‐deficient core and π‐bridge units as an effective strategy to optimize the properties of HTMs and improve their performance in PVSC applications.",

This review comprehensively examines the sustainable production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and its applications in green chemical synthesis. H2O2, known as a green oxidant, is generated through the 2e− ORR pathway using various catalysts, including noble metals, carbon‐based materials, single‐atom catalysts, and transition metal oxides. This method offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional H2O2 production, enabling in‐situ synthesis without organic waste. The review highlights the direct role of H2O2 in promoting chemical transformations, such as the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides and alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Additionally, it explores the indirect application of H2O2 through its decomposition into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in Fenton reactions, which drive selective oxidation and degradation processes. These applications demonstrate the versatility of H2O2 in advancing green chemistry by facilitating eco‐friendly oxidation reactions and pollutant degradation. Future work will focus on improving catalyst stability and scalability for industrial use, further enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of H2O2‐based chemical processes.",

Microsamples from these murals were analyzed using micro‐invasive techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy‐dispersive spectroscopy (SEM‐EDS), and Raman microspectroscopy. The study revealed a preparation layer of gypsum/anhydrite on adobe walls and a simple yet diverse palette of pigments. Red pigments included hematite (Fe₂O₃) and organic carmine dye, while green hues featured copper‐based pigments such as antlerite (Cu₃SO₄(OH)₃) and posnjakite (Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆·H₂O), identified here for the first time as a major component in Andean mural paintings. Blue tones were achieved using indigo and smalt, a cobalt‐containing glass pigment whose presence is still scarcely documented in Peruvian murals. These findings deepen our understanding of colonial pigment selection, preparation practices, and their deterioration mechanisms, contributing to sustainable conservation strategies.

The knowledge obtained can be useful for leaching minerals with disseminated native platinum in refractory minerals such as silicates of which there are large quantities in nature but are not processed due to their great refractoriness. The results show that increasing the temperature and the HClO4 concentration increases the leaching rate. Interestingly, for each HClO4 concentration, an H2O2/HClO4 = 2.5 ratio exists that optimises the leaching kinetics. The best operating conditions were approximately 70 °C, [HClO4] 3M, and [H2O2] 7.2 M. From kinetic analysis, it was concluded that the leaching process is governed by a mixed control stage (diffusion in the boundary layer and surface chemical reaction). Also, it was proposed that the leaching process mechanism is supported by fundamental thermodynamic and experimental results, highlighting the importance of chlorine gas for this novel extraction method that reaches elevated recoveries. This process is also interesting because the chemical system can potentially weaken the crystallographic structure of silicates (very important), increasing the feasibility of extracting the partially not liberated precious metals.",

Since the discovery of catalytic reactivities in Au‐based materials, including nanoparticles, molecular complexes, and nanoclusters (AuNCs), mechanistic insights into the interaction and reductive activation of O2 by Au have been pursued by researchers. However, the atomic level understanding of the reaction mechanism remains elusive compared with that for other widely explored transition metalO2 systems. This paper briefly discusses recent progress in clarifying the reaction mechanisms of Au‐O2 chemistry for homogeneous molecular Au complexes and atomically precise AuNCs. We introduce our research on (1) O2‐activation by Au complexes without the distinct formation of conventional metal‐hydride species, and (2) the application of kinetic analyses to the reaction of thiolate‐protected AuNCs with O2 to quantify parameters like O2‐binding constants on the Au surface. These findings help elucidate both the Au‐O2 interaction and reductive activation of O2, which are essential in catalytic systems using O2 as a terminal oxidant that can contribute to the developments of eco‐friendly oxidation Au‐based catalysts with high performance.",

Photocatalytic water splitting experiment was performed and amount of hydrogen evolved for 5 hrs was measured to be 1104 μmol/g for NTO‐CN, which was greater by a factor of 2.32 and 1.43 as that of NaTaO3 and g‐C3N4 respectively. In comparison to bare g‐C3N4 and NaTaO3, the NTO‐CN heterostructure photocatalyst demonstrated maximized photocatalytic performance. This study analyzed advancing practical application of NaTaO3 photocatalysts by forming heterostructure with g‐C3N4.",

Herein, first, the terpolymerization of CO2, propylene oxide (PO), and epichlorohydrin (ECH) to synthesize PPC‐ECH terpolymers via one‐pot and metal‐free method using multinuclear organoboron catalysts is reported. The PPC‐ECH terpolymers with well‐rounded properties can be easily synthesized by adjusting reaction conditions, monomer ratios, catalyst types, and loading. The molecular weight of the PPC‐ECH terpolymer can reach up to 59.4 kg mol−1, which is the highest known. Notably, the synthesized PPC‐ECH exhibits outstanding barrier performance with oxygen permeability as low as 1.31 cm3 mm (m2 day)−1 and water vapor permeability as low as 0.016 g mm (m2 day)−1, significantly lower than those of pure PPC or other common packaging materials. Importantly, the introduction of a small amount of ECH not only preserves the biodegradability of polycarbonate but also markedly enhances its mechanical properties, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and flame retardancy, offering promising prospects for application in packaging materials.",

To this purpose we examine an acrylic painting on raw canvas, Tela by Giorgio Griffa (1973), and the model samples purposely prepared together with the painter. Felt‐tip marker vandalic act, by which the painting was disfigured, is analyzed as well. The analytical approach entails combination of non‐invasive spectroscopic techniques to study the molecular composition and changes induced by artificial ageing in model samples.

The dispersions were formulated by combining cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and hydrophobically modified ethylhydroxyethylcellulose with beeswax nanoemulsions. The beeswax nanoemulsion was prepared using the Ouzo effect, a low‐energy, surfactant‐free, and spontaneous emulsification method. EHM serves as an anchor for CNC and beeswax nanoparticles on the canvas, forming a continuous film and preventing aggregation during the treatment process. Tensile tests and contact angle measurements demonstrated that the dispersions effectively strengthen the canvas and enhance its water resistance, addressing the moisture‐induced mechanical limitations observed with previous nanocellulose and polyelectrolyte consolidants. Additionally, the hydrophobicity of the beeswax‐CNC/EHM system can be adjusted by varying the beeswax content. Overall, the use of entirely green components and the straightforward preparation process make this dispersion system highly adaptable for consolidation in cultural heritage conservation, particularly in scenarios where a hydrophobic surface is required.",

    "abstract": "The low operating temperature limit of commercial supercapacitor electrolyte (−50 °C) could not satisfy the increasing extreme demands like polar resource exploitation (−60 °C) and near‐space exploration (−70 °C). Although the introduction of cosolvents with low polarities could improve the viscosity and operating temperature range, the multisolvent electrolyte system still endures low conductivity and high desolvation energy as well as the high production cost. This work introduces the acetone (ACT) as monosolvent for low‐temperature electrolyte, which shows the medium dielectric coefficient (ε = 20.9), low donor number (10.67), and ultralow melting point. These properties guarantee its strong ion‐dissociation ability for rapid ion‐transportation in the bulk electrolyte, and weakened ion‐solvent interaction for speeding desolvation process, as well as the outstanding temperature range of liquid phase. The supercapacitor with ACT‐based electrolyte exhibits superior capacitance retention ratio (86.5% from 20 to −70 °C), high cycling stability (97.75% after 13,000 cycles) and preeminent power density and energy density (3776 W kg−1 @ 14.16 W h kg−1). Besides, the ACT solvent also displays the merits of low biological toxicity and low production cost, which further enhance its application prospect in the energy storage systems.",

    "abstract": "The exploitation of an efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a crucial role in the slow kinetics of the cathode in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this study, a catalyst loaded with PtCo alloys on Co and N co‐doped carbon nanotubes (PtCoNC) is synthesized for oxygen reduction reaction, which has high activity and stability. The carbon nanotube structure provides efficient transport channels for reactant exchange and product transport, as well as provides a wealth of triple‐phase sites, that improves the utilization of Pt. Further, the PtCoNC catalyst exhibits robust metal‐support interactions, which can be attributed to the anchoring of the Co‐Nx sites to Pt. Theoretical calculations indicating an increase in binding energy and a reduction in layer spacing provide conclusive verification of the presence of augmented interactions between PtCo nanoparticles and the support. As a result, the low Pt‐loaded (0.025 mg cm−2) PtCoNC catalyst demonstrates superior ORR activity to that of commercial Pt/C with an impressive half‐wave potential of 0.893 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. At 0.9 V vs RHE, its mass activity and specific activity are 3 and 2.6 times that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. It also shows better stability in acidic environment.",

To improve their PLQY and p‐RTP, pressing the powder into tablets has been preliminarily proven to be an effective method, but the specific mechanism has not been fully elucidated yet. Here, carboxymethyl β‐cyclodextrin (CM‐β‐CD) has been chosen as the representative to solve the problem. The results showed that the PLQY and p‐RTP lifetimes of the tablet of CM‐β‐CD were improved compared to the powder. By the mechanism of clustering‐triggered emission (CTE) and average packing density‐promoted emission (PDE) mechanism, it has been demonstrated that the enhanced molecular interactions after compression is the key reason, which resulting in the formation of cluster emission centers with stronger emission capabilities.

The discussion focuses on key adsorption mechanisms, structural modifications, and functionalization strategies that enhance iodine adsorption capacity, retention, and recyclability. While significant progress has been made, challenges remain in scaling up synthesis, improving stability under industrial conditions, and achieving cost‐effective large‐scale applications. Future research should emphasize on scalable synthesis, industrial validation, and development of multifunctional adsorbents with enhanced selectivity and reusability.

    "abstract": "Bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis are typically developed by combining separate OER and ORR electrocatalysts to form composites, often requiring complex synthesis methods. In this study, we present a simplified approach by mechanical blending of BaSr2CoTiSbO9 (BSCTS), an OER catalyst, with BaSr2MnTiSbO9 (BSMTS), an ORR catalyst, to construct a composite bifunctional electrocatalyst. The DFT calculation supports superior ORR activity of BSMTS due to an uplifted Mn d‐band center than the Co d‐band and its proximity to the Fermi level, whereas the greater OER activity of BSCTS is due to the uplifted O 2p band center. While microstructural similarity of BSCTS and BSMTS facilitates efficient mixing for composite formation, the mechanical blending avoids intervention of complex synthesis procedures. The resulting bifunctional composite electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent performance with a bifunctional index of 0.72 V and a peak power density of 125 mW/cm2 when used as an air cathode electrocatalyst in Zn‐air battery (ZAB). This approach underscores the importance of mechanical blending of microstructurally compatible OER and ORR catalysts in designing practical bifunctional electrocatalysts for zinc‐air batteries.",

    "abstract": "Artificial lighting, essential for geotouristic purposes in subterranean sites, has facilitated the growth of colored photosynthetic organisms (lampenflora) on two monumental 19th‐century bas‐reliefs of the Pommery Champagne cellar ‐ a UNESCO‐protected heritage site ‐ causing significant aesthetic and physical deterioration. To sustainably preserve these stone artworks, biocidal polyoxometalate‐ionic liquids (POM‐ILs) were tested alongside the commercial biocide Preventol RI80® on three trial zones, cleaned and colonized areas of a wall, and clean stone samples positioned on a testing station within the cellar. After one year, untreated control areas exhibited growth/regrowth of green biofilms, whereas surfaces treated with POM‐ILs or Preventol RI80® remained biofilm‐free. Measurements of colorimetry and chlorophyll fluorescence confirmed the effectiveness of both biocides in controlling photosynthetic microorganisms. However, confocal fluorescence microscopy highlighted a reduced long‐term inhibition by Preventol RI80® compared to POM‐ILs, despite the latter being applied at lower concentrations. Metagenomic analysis validated the performance of POM‐ILs, showing a notable decrease in microbial richness and diversity in treated areas. While both products effectively inhibited phototrophs and fungi, their efficacy against Pseudomonadota was limited, due to microbial adaptation via antibiotic resistance genes. This study underscores the potential of POM‐ILs as a sustainable alternative for preserving cultural heritage against microbial colonization.",

    "abstract": "Selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds under mild conditions holds significant promise for industrial applications. However, the performance of photocatalysts is notably hindered by limited visible‐light absorption, low charge separation and transfer efficiency, as well as weak adsorption and activation of aromatic alcohols and O2. In this study, we successfully synthesized a Boron‐doped defect‐rich Fe3O4@B‐CeO2/Au photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) under visible light. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that boron doping not only introduces a heteroatomic energy level that acts as 'intermediate springboards', significantly broadening the absorption range of visible light, but also creates abundant oxygen vacancies and acidic sites, benefiting the adsorption and activation of O2 and BA. Furthermore, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Au further improves the transport of interfacial photogenerated electrons. Due to these combined advantages, the selectivity of the Fe3O4@B‐CeO2/Au photocatalyst for BAD reached 100%, and the conversion rate of BA was as high as 98.96% after 8 hours of reaction under visible light. Moreover, owing to the magnetic properties of the Fe3O4 core, the photocatalyst exhibits excellent operational and cyclic stability.",

    "abstract": "Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) containing UiO‐type MOFs have shown excellent potential for CO2 separation processes due to their unique permeability and selectivity properties. However, while the performance of MOF‐based MMMs has been widely studied, the effect of structural defects and polymer‐filler compatibility are not yet fully understood. In this work, we systematically evaluate the CO2 separation performance of Pebax® MH1657‐based MMMs incorporating 5 to 20 wt% of Zr‐based MOF, including UiO‐66, UiO‐67, and two defect‐engineered UiO‐66 analogues, featuring extended linker (UiO‐66_A) or cluster (UiO‐66_F) vacancies. The structural, morphological, and thermal properties of the membranes were thoroughly characterised, with emphasis on correlating these features with gas transport performance. Single gas permeation experiments (CO2, CH4, H2) revealed that incorporating UiO nanoparticles within the matrix consistently enhanced CO2 permeability, reaching 145 Barrer for the 20 wt% UiO‐66_F MMM, a 216.4% increase over the neat membrane. CO2/CH4 and CO2/H2 selectivities also improved upon increasing MOF loadings, with UiO‐66_F achieving values of 25 and 18, respectively. This study provides insights for designing high‐performance MMMs for CO2 separation applications, such as biogas upgrading and hydrogen purification.",

Most glass fragments originate from naturally colored or intentionally colored tableware, which were either monochrome (green or blue) or polychrome (mosaic millefiori glass of brown or green matrix with red and yellow trails or transparent blue glass matrix splashed with opaque white spots). The typological analysis indicated that some vessels fragments originated from Isings 2, 5, 37, and 81 forms, argument constraining the chronology of the discovery context from the 1st c. BC to the 1st c. AD. A bracelet fragment and a bead were also analyzed. The compositional pattern is typical for the coeval Hellenistic and Roman glass finds; several examples of items manufactured using plant ash were evidenced, too. IBA results, corroborated with archaeological information, indicated that several fragments originate from the same vessel. Chemical analyses supported the underlying archaeological hypothesis that the glass items arrived to the Iron Age settlement from nowadays Tinosu through exchanges between the local populations and the Hellenistic and the Roman world.",

In this study, a stable persistent radical (Pybtm) was incorporated as an ancillary ligand into a platinum(II) biscyclometalated complex to modulate its emission properties. Photophysical analysis of the newly synthesised and characterised complexes revealed distinct behaviours: doublet emission from the radical complex and phosphorescent emission for the neutral complex, observed both at room temperature in solution and in thin films (doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) as well as in 2‐Me‐THF at 77 K. Detailed investigations, supported by DFT and TD‐DFT calculations corroborate that the emission properties are strongly dictated by the neutral and the radical ancillary ligand. Additionally, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies verified the radical nature of these complexes, highlighting their potential for OLED applications.",

This modification significantly enhances the solubility and facilitates efficient chirality transfer resulting in distinct circular dichroism (CD) activity, which is quite remarkable in organic small molecule solutions. Furthermore, acid‐triggered protonation of the dye leads to a bathochromic shift in the maximum absorption wavelength (from 633 to 664 nm) and an increase in NIR emission intensity, which is attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer in solution.",

This study aims to develop biodegradable films using starch blended with chitosan, plasticized by choline chloride [Ch][Cl], and choline acetate [Ch][OAc], an ionic liquid derived from choline. The decision to exploit the plasticizer ability of bio‐based ionic compounds depends on their excellent properties, such as non‐volatility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. The research evaluates the effects of varying starch and chitosan fractions, as well as the two plasticizers, on the properties of the resulting films. Morphology, chemical composition, crystallinity, mechanical properties, thermal stability, and wettability are evaluated through different techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and performing mechanical and wettability tests. Characterization analyses highlight the primary influence of the anion on the properties of the different blends, suggesting the greater plasticizer capacity of the acetate anion.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the synthesis of bio‐lubricants derived from palm oil, highlighting its potential as a sustainable alternative to petroleum‐based lubricants. Through epoxidation and subsequent ring‐opening reactions using isoamyl alcohol, palmitic acid esters (PAE), with enhanced thermal and oxidative stability is developed. Optimal ring‐opening reaction conditions, identified as 100 °C with p‐toluenesulfonic acid as the catalyst. The synthesized bio‐lubricant PAE, exhibits superior tribological performance, achieving lower friction coefficients and reduced wear scar diameters compared to the original palm oil. Comparing PAE with palm oil, the average coefficient of friction is reduced by 9.8%, the PB value increased from 82 to 88 kg, and the PD value increased from 620 to 800 kg. The average grinding spot diameter decreased from about 600 to 500 μm, a decrease of 16.7%. These findings highlight its potential as a sustainable and effective industrial lubricant. This study underscores the significance of chemical modification in enhancing the performance of bio‐lubricants and contributes to the development of environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional petroleum‐based products, offering sustainable solutions for industrial lubrication needs.",

However, traditional chemical methods for AuNPs synthesis present certain challenges, such as the use of harsh chemicals and high energy consumption. These limitations have led to the development of alternative, sustainable synthesis methods that are efficient, cost‐effective, and environmentally friendly. These methods focus on the principle of green chemistry, utilizing renewable biomass sources (e.g., plant tissues, bacteria, fungi, and algae) and nontoxic solvents to minimize environmental impact. Biomolecules derived from biomass, such as polyphenols, proteins, and unsaturated fatty acids, enable the synthesis of AuNPs under mild and eco‐friendly conditions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the sustainable synthesis and applications of AuNPs. It summarizes the specific active compounds that drive the reduction and stabilization of AuNPs. It also explores the characterization techniques and underlying mechanisms involved in synthesis. Furthermore, their cellular effects and long‐term safety are discussed, along with their extensive applications in biomedical fields, including bioimaging and cancer therapies. Finally, the potential of AuNPs is summarized, highlighting future perspectives as well as emerging opportunities and challenges in biological applications.",

    "abstract": "The availability of structural biology methods for nucleic acid still lags behind that of proteins, as evidenced by the smaller number of structures (DNA: 2513, RNA: 1899, nucleic acid–protein complexes: 13 842, protein: 196 887) deposited in the protein database. The skewed ratio of nucleic acid structures, relative to proteins (≈1:50), is inverted with respect to the cellular output of RNA and proteins in higher organisms (≈50:1). While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an attractive biophysical tool capable of bridging this gap at the molecular level, the conformational flexibility, line broadening, and low chemical shift dispersion of nucleic acids have made the NMR method challenging, especially for structures larger than 35 nucleotides. The incorporation of NMR‐active isotopes is a f strategy to combat these problems. Significant strides made to push the size limits of nucleic acid structures solved by NMR using chemoenzymatic 13C‐ methyl and aromatic 15N‐ and 19F–13C‐labeling are reviewed and challenges and opportunities are evaluated. Combining these isotopic labeling patterns with superior NMR spectroscopic properties, and new DNA/RNA synthesis methods (palindrome‐nicking‐dependent amplification and segmental labeling and site‐specific modifications by template‐directed tension), may stimulate advances in NMR studies of large DNA/RNA and their complexes with important biological functions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of urinary stones, including infection urinary stones, especially in highly developed countries. One of the areas where the cause of the increased morbidity in these countries can be found is food products and their ingredients, which are not as common in other countries. Very often, attention is drawn to the greater consumption of highly processed food, the production of which uses flavour enhancers and various preservatives. One of the substances used in the food industry as an acidity regulator or antioxidant is phosphoric acid. It is used in the production of many products from food, sweets, beers to soft drinks, e. g. Coca‐Cola. In this paper, we present the results of research on the effect of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) on the mineralization and growth of carbonate apatite Ca10(PO4)6CO3 (CA) and hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (HAP), which are one of the main components of infection urinary stones, next to struvite. The research was conducted in an artificial urine environment in two ways: in the presence of Proteus mirabilis bacteria and without them. In the latter case, bacterial urease activity was simulated by adding an aqueous ammonia solution. The results obtained, both in the presence of bacteria and without them, indicate that phosphoric acid present in artificial urine causes a shift in the mineralization of CA and HAP towards a lower pH, which means that these components mineralize earlier in artificial urine compared to the control sample. On the other hand, the amount of solid phases formed is smaller, the higher the concentration of phosphoric acid. The effect of phosphoric acid on the mineralization of CA and HAP was explained on the basis of theoretical speciation analysis of chemical complexes formed in urine in the presence of the tested acid. This analysis indicates that the experimentally observed shift in the formation of solid phases towards a lower pH with increasing phosphoric acid concentration is related to the earlier appearance of C10(PO4)6(OH)2 complexes, forming HAP, and not to C10(PO4)6CO3 complexes, forming CA. It should be remembered that the described effect of this acid on the formation of CA and HAP is possible only when the urinary tract is infected with urease‐positive bacteria. In the absence of infection, phosphoric acid will not cause the formation of solid phases characteristic of infection urinary stones.",

To accelerate catalyst design, a machine learning‐based stacked model is developed, integrating random forest and XGBoost (XGB) as base models with linear regression as a meta‐model. This approach mitigates overfitting, achieving superior predictive performance (R2 = 0.98 train, 0.91 test) compared to XGB alone (R2 = 0.99 train, 0.86 test). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identifies pyridinic nitrogen (N) as a key driver of CO selectivity but reveals that its influence varies with different carbon substrates. SHAP interaction analysis uncovers a strong synergy between pyridinic‐N and graphitic‐N, where their combined impact on CO production exceeds their individual effects. Furthermore, the optimal pyridinic‐N content depends on the carbon structure with distinct SHAP clustering for materials like graphene and carbon black. These insights provide a data‐driven strategy for optimizing N‐doped carbon catalysts, enabling targeted material selection to enhance CO2 reduction to CO.",

Specifically, aza‐Michael addition and sulfur (VI) fluoride exchange reactions are used for functionalization. The modified drugs are both synthesized and characterized using an automated HT‐DESI MS platform, with the reaction occurring during the droplet flight. Analysis by MS characterizes reaction products at a throughput of >1 reaction per second. With this platform, multiple nor‐opioid scaffolds and functionalization reagents are screened and a selection of the hits obtained is subjected to HT label‐free bioassays using the same DESI‐MS platform. This combination of accelerated LSF reactions to rapidly create a diverse library of functionalized drugs with direct bioassays of the crude reaction mixtures for structure–activity relationship evaluation, both using the same platform, is anticipated to help expedite the early drug discovery process.",

Six root samples collected from traditional habitats are also analyzed to propose their quality markers. From 37 compounds common to all root samples, 8 compounds are proposed as potential quality markers based on their widespread presence and abundance across traditional growing regions.

In this study, we identify the sterol metabolism‐related genes, which encode the aldolases (Ltp2 and Thl) and carboxylic acid reductases (CAR) in Mycolicibacterium neoaurum NRRL B‐3805 (B3805), by analysis of the metabolites from phytosterols biotransformation.

This recombinant strain (B3805V) is able to transform 5 g L−1 phytosterols to 2.0 g L−1 4‐HBC without detectable AD by‐product. Additionally, by disrupting the ltp2 and car genes, a strain (strain B3805VI) is obtained to transform phytosterols to PDCE with 1.44 g L−1 titer.

The investigated sensitizers exhibit maximum absorption between 400 and 442 nm with light‐harvesting efficiencies exceeding 93%. Favorable interactions are observed between the dyes and the hydrogenated TiO2 cluster, (TiO2)6H3. The obtained binding energies range from −1.39 to −0.97 eV in the gas phase and −0.31 to −0.03 eV in water. The electronic spectra of the dye@TiO2 complexes show broader and intensive bands with bathochromic shifts when compared to the individual dyes. The charge density distribution in the complexes indicates appropriate ability of the dyes for charge injection to the semiconductor. Among the considered dyes, the most promising candidates for use in DSSCs have been selected.",

This study aims to evaluate the interfacial and thermodynamic properties of five widely used petroleum surfactants to better understand their efficiency under mild reservoir‐like conditions. IFT is measured using the spinning drop tensiometer across a temperature range of 25–40 °C, while critical micelle concentrations (CMC) are determined via conductometric methods. Thermodynamic parameters of micellization are calculated from temperature‐dependent CMC data. The results show that micellization is an entropy‐driven process for all tested surfactants. The studied surfactants significantly reduce IFT values within the tested temperature range, underscoring their potential for practical application in EOR formulations. The study also confirms that accurate determination of CMC is essential in optimizing surfactant efficiency under varying environmental conditions.",

Utilizing the aggregation‐induced emission characteristic of TPEs, this study demonstrates that BPh‐TPE and BRh‐TPE function as “turn‐off” fluorescent sensors for detecting Cu2+ and Hg2+/Ag+, respectively, exhibiting quenched fluorescence in the presence of these ions. The limits of detection (LODs) for Cu2+, Hg2+, and Ag+ are determined to be 299, 522 nM, and 1.58 μM, respectively. Interestingly, the probes also show “turn‐on” fluorescence upon the addition of glutathione (GSH) in the presence of Cu2+ or Hg2+. Specifically, the LOD for GSH using the BPh‐TPE‐Cu2+ complex is 457 nM. Practical applicability is confirmed via visual color changes on filter paper and in water samples. These findings highlight the potential of these TPE derivatives for detecting copper, mercury, silver ions, and GSH in environmental water. Additionally, Al/organic layer/p‐Si heterojunction devices incorporating spin‐coated TPE layers are fabricated. Their electrical behaviors are analyzed through current‐voltage and current‐time measurements under varying light conditions. Transient photocurrent analysis indicates strong photoresponse, supporting their suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.",

It is well known that various microorganisms synthesize and store high‐molecular‐weight polyhydroxyalkanoates in their cytoplasm as water‐insoluble inclusions. In this study, the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii N‐15 strain is used for bioplastic production. The optimal polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) yield (62% of biomass, 23.6 g L−1 dry cells) is achieved by cultivating the bacteria in Burke's medium with molasses as a carbon source (5 wt.%) at 30 °C, 220 rpm, for 50 h. The resulting polymer was characterized using thin‐layer chromatography, UV‐Vis, fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and X‐ray diffraction. The results confirmed that the polymer is PHB with a purity of 98.9%, a molecular weight of 1.2 MDa, a crystallinity of 73%, a melting point of 179 °C, a decomposition temperature of 275 °C, a density of 1.22 g cm−3, a melt flow index of 10 g 10 min−1, a Shore hardness of 82, a tensile strength of 30 MPa, and a relative elongation at break of 4.5%. Thus, a bioplastic with properties suitable for practical applications is successfully obtained using molasses—a byproduct of sugar production.",

Here, fluorescence‐based logic gates have been constructed by leveraging the binding interactions between a hemicyanine dye, 4‐[4‐(dimethylamino)‐styryl]‐1‐docosylpyridinium bromide (DASPC22) and β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) that could be useful to know whether ClO4− ions in water are within the toxicity range or not. In aqueous media, DASPC22 forms nonfluorescent H‐aggregates, but fluorescence is enhanced upon forming host‐guest inclusion complexes with β‐CD. At low ClO4− ions concentrations, fluorescence intensity further increases due to enhanced complex stability through hydrogen bonding. ONIOM‐based quantum chemical calculations have supported this phenomenon. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of DASPC22 in the presence of β‐CD and a low concentration of ClO4− ions leads to the construction of a YES logic gate that would enable one to quantify ClO4− ions’ toxicity range in water. Dual‐input‐single‐output AND and INHIBIT logic gates with low and high concentrations of ClO4− ions, respectively, have also been constructed.

The presence of neutral abpt, as well as azido ligands was proved by IR spectroscopy and the composition of the complexes confirmed an elemental analysis. Monocrystal X‐ray structure analysis revealed that 1 is an ionic pentacoordinated Cu(II) complex, exhibiting a distorted tetragonal pyramidal geometry of the coordination polyhedron, while 2 is a neutral molecular complex with a distorted octahedral environment of the Cu(II) atom. The structures are stabilized by π–π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of abpt, as well as various intra‐ and intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving nitrate ions and molecules of solvated water in 1 and 2, respectively. A field‐induced slow magnetic relaxation was observed at low temperatures in 1, described by the direct and Raman process involving low‐energy intramolecular vibrational modes, which were predicted by the DFT calculations.",

Due to resistance phenomena, the last decade has seen a significant challenge for candidiasis treatment with antifungal drugs, which has led to an urgent need for new antifungal agents. In this article, we report the synthesis of a series of azomethine‐pyrazole derivatives bearing a para‐substituted azo‐phenyl ring. These compounds were evaluated as antifungal agents against Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans strains. Compound ClAzoNH, substituted by chloride, displayed the highest toxicity on Candida albicans, with an MIC50 value of 2.08 μg/mL, while methoxy‐substituted MeOAzoNH showed moderate inhibitory activity. The unsubstituted AzoNH compound exhibited the highest activity towards Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei strains. In the case of C. albicans, the CaCYP51 protein appears to be the most probable biological target, while for C. neoformans, interactions with the CnFTase protein explained the in vitro results.",

This workflow not only streamlines the identification of potential inhibitors but also ensures a systematic approach to prioritizing candidates. Through structural clustering, we identified ten promising PARP‐1 inhibitors. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PBSA were employed to elucidate the binding modes of compounds 1, 3, 6, and 9 with PARP‐1, providing valuable insights into their interaction mechanisms and supporting future drug development efforts.

This review aims to investigate the prospect of using biochar specifically from alien vegetation as a support material for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell electrocatalyst, highlighting the need to move to green energy and invest in Eco conservation. The use of biochar derived from alien vegetation as carbon support for the platinum (Pt) electrocatalyst for PEM fuel cells is an interesting field that is slowly gaining momentum. Biochar has the potential to be used as a carbon support due to its high specific surface, area, and intrinsic property needed for an electrocatalyst support. The current widely used electrocatalyst, which is Pt supported on carbon black, has shown to suffer from corrosion which weakens the bond between the support and the Pt nanoparticles, leading to instability and resistance; therefore, alternative supports are needed also to decrease the Pt loading as it is expensive. The focus of this review is on the benefits and prospects of these cheap green resources in increasing efforts to conserve the environment.",

Linden flower extract is prepared and used for the biosynthesis of Ag NPs. Sodium borohydride, NaBH4, is used as a reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Ag NPs are characterized by the X‐ray diffraction (XRD) method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and UV‐visible spectrometry. According to the XRD results, the crystal sizes for G–Ag and C–Ag are calculated to be 24.07 and 5.91 nm, respectively. G–Ag and C–Ag NP‐modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) are used as electrochemical methods to determine BA. The limits of detection of G–Ag and C–Ag NP‐modified GCEs are calculated as 1.67 mM limit of quantification and 10 mM, respectively. The linear ranges of GCEs modified with nanomaterials are determined as 2.40–8.01 mM for C–Ag and 4.84–14.66 mM for G–Ag. The study is significant in that the NPs obtained by the biological synthesis method showed as good activity as the particles synthesized by the chemical method.",

However, their inherent challenges, such as poor electrical conductivity, significant volume expansion, and instability of the solid‐electrolyte interphase layer, hinder their widespread commercialization. This study addresses these issues using the dry particle coating method with nanostructured fumed aluminum oxide (Al2O3), a novel approach with significant potential for commercial scalability. The impact of surface wettability on performance is studied by applying metal oxide coatings, using hydrophilic and hydrophobized surfaces. Electrochemical evaluation shows a significant increase in rate performance and cycle life when the surface coating is applied, with improvements in discharge capacity of around 10% and 17% for hydrophobized and hydrophilic Al2O3 coatings, respectively, after 100 cycles. The Al2O3 coating protects the surface of the active material, preventing particle pulverization, reducing side reactions, and decreasing electrolyte decomposition and hydrofluoric acid content. While overall performance improves with coating, the best results are achieved with the hydrophilic coating, which fosters a more homogeneous microstructured electrode. These findings underscore the potential of the dry particle coating technique with Al2O3 to enhance Si‐based anode performance and facilitate commercial application.",

This study introduces an orthogonally protected 3‐iodo‐Kdo fluoride donor and demonstrates its coupling to a pre‐synthesized β‐(1→6)‐linked N‐acetylglucosamine disaccharide acceptor as an example. Nuclear magnetic resonance data indicates the presence of an intraresidue hydrogen bond in the distal glucosamine unit. Two complementary glycosylation approaches are explored with an emphasis on achieving high stereoselectivity and minimizing protecting‐group manipulation. The orthogonal protection of 3‐iodo Kdo fluoride donor offers insights into tailoring Kdo‐based donors for specific biomedical applications. While yields vary depending on the approach, they are sufficient to demonstrate the donor's applicability. These findings enable the design of advanced glycomimetic constructs for therapeutic and vaccine research.",

Stable target compounds are obtained in good yields as crystalline solids by the combination of [fc(CPh2CHNMe)][BF4] with N,N′‐dimethylimidazolin‐2‐ylidene and of [fc(CPh2CHN‐p‐C6H4‐tBu)](OTf) with 1,3,4,5‐tetramethylimidazolin‐2‐ylidene, respectively, followed by treatment of the resulting addition product with KN(SiMe3)2. Due to the presence of a triaminoethene unit and a ferrocene moiety, four redox states are expected for such fcCAAC–NHC heterodimers, viz., electroneutral, mono‐, di‐, and tricationic. An investigation of their redox behavior by electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry) has revealed that these compounds undergo two consecutive one‐electron oxidations, with the poor stability of the dicationic species in solution preventing an observation of the tricationic redox state. A density functional theory (DFT) study shows that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on the CCN2 atom, which, in agreement with electron paramagnetic resonance results, is the site of the first oxidation. The second oxidation mainly involves the Fe atom, where the HOMO−1 is localized, resulting in a species with a triplet ground state composed, to a first approximation, of a carbon‐centered and an iron‐centered radical.",

    "abstract": "Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme present in the human body responsible for the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated chemical species. It is primarily expressed in organs such as bones, liver, intestine, and placenta during pregnancy, playing a crucial role in cellular processes like gene expression, transport, and metabolism. Physiological ALP levels vary with age and sex, with normal serum ranges for healthy adults between 40 and 190 U/L. Alterations in ALP levels can be indicative of several pathologies, including cancer diagnosis and metastasis, as well as bone growth dysfunctions and hypophosphatasia. Conventional methods for ALP detection often require complex assay principles, extensive sample pretreatment, and trained personnel. Herein, the development of a portable, flexible electrochemical sensor fabricated through screen‐printing to monitor ALP levels in biological samples is introduced. The flexible electrochemical sensor, characterized by high efficiency, sustainability, low cost, and ease of disposal, achieves detection limit as low as 0.03 and 0.08 U/L, respectively, in buffer solution and human serum samples, and a satisfactory repeatability lower than 10%. This simple sensor configuration approach enables real‐time disease monitoring and improves access to point‐of‐care diagnostics, paving the way for affordable, decentralized sensors that support early diagnosis and better healthcare.",

Herein, Al‐ and In‐doped ZnO semiconductor thermoelectric material is synthesized, produced, and examined for use in the production of thermoelectric generators that can be used in aviation applications. The synthesis of ZnAlIn powders is carried out by the sol–gel method. The xerogel is dried at 200 °C for 10 h, and the dried material is then calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in an atmospheric oven to obtain ZnAlIn material. The obtained powder is then compressed with a cold press to produce pellet samples. Pellet samples are sintered in an atmospheric furnace at 1350 °C for 36 h and are made ready for measurements. Comprehensive characterization and analysis of microstructural and structural properties are performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis‐thermogravimetry, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X‐ray diffraction methods. Seebeck coefficient and thermal capacity measurements are performed to determine thermoelectric properties.

Au–Ru nanoparticles are obtained on MW‐5Au5Ru while short Au–Ru nanochains are obtained on DP‐5Au5Ru. The performance of the catalysts is tested through the oxidation of 2,3,5‐trimethylhydroquinone (TMHQ) and 4‐methoxy‐1‐naphthol (MNL) with H2O2, in which 2,3,5‐trimethyl‐1,4‐benzoquinone (TMBQ) and 4,4′‐dimethoxy‐2,2′‐binaphthalenylidene‐1,1′‐dione (BNP) are produced as main products, respectively. Catalytic data obtained for the oxidation of TMHQ demonstrate that the structures of the catalysts, type of solvent, and reaction temperatures used have a significant influence on the activities and selectivities of the catalysts. When MeOH and MeNO2 are used at room temperature (RT) in the oxidation of TMHQ on MW‐5Au5Ru catalyst, 58.2% and 100% conversions of TMHQ are achieved, respectively. Both MW and DP‐synthesized catalysts are highly active in the oxidation of TMHQ. Similar to TMHQ, the catalytic outcomes on the oxidative coupling of MNL highly depend on the temperature and structure of the catalyst. For example, 34% and 96% conversions of MNL are achieved at RT and 60 °C, respectively, over MW‐5Au5Ru catalyst in MeOH. However, MNL conversion of 82% is achieved on DP‐5Au5Ru catalyst in MeOH at RT.",

A Pd[0]‐mediated glucosylation reaction applied to this bromotropone afforded a product mixture from which an enantiomerically pure cross‐coupling product could be obtained and its structure confirmed through single‐crystal X‐ray analysis of a derivative. Various (unsuccessful) attempts are described to selectively acylate the last compound and thereby install the 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaric acid or HMGA‐containing side chain of the title natural product. A literature survey of other natural products embodying the HMGA motif suggest that liriosmaside A and its co‐metabolite liriosmaside B could be S‐configured at C3”. The evaluation of the glucosylated tropone in a series of anti‐bacterial, anti‐fungal and cytotoxicity assays reveals that it is inactive in all of these and so emphasizing the prospect that this and related troponoids, including the natural products liriosmaside A and B, can serve as useful models for new anti‐viral agents.",

DPOR enables photosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria by catalyzing the MgATP hydrolysis‐dependent, stereoselective two‐electron reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide). This requires the repeated transient association of DPOR's two component proteins (BchL and BchNB), and involves a series of individual and unresolved sequence of events (including MgATP‐hydrolysis, electron transfer, protein association/dissociation, substrate binding, etc.). DPOR shares structural and mechanistic similarities with nitrogenase, although the spectroscopic properties of Pchlide and Chlide permit the reaction to be followed in situ with visible spectroscopy. Here, we investigate DPOR's mechanism through vis‐spectroscopy in the absence of an electron donor in the system, where we were able to observe the formation of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex prior to substrate reduction (electron transfer and MgATP hydrolysis). The determination of rate constants for ES formation as well as overall electron transfer reveals the complex rate‐limiting interplay between these two processes. Further, we observe evidence of cooperativity for ES complex formation in DPOR, which may be the origin of cooperativity during enzymatic turnover.",

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provide innovative, low‐cost solutions for developing intelligent digital motion monitoring systems. In this study, we designed a multi‐mode triboelectric nanogenerator (M‐TENG) that incorporates multiple working modes, enabling switching between internal electrodes to adjust the output mode. This dual working mode enhances the adaptability of the device for football monitoring applications. The versatile design allows the M‐TENG to perform both energy harvesting and trigger‐based sensing and monitoring, contributing to the advancement of digital intelligence movement technologies. After optimization, the M‐TENG achieved a transferred charge (Qsc) of 88.38 nC, short‐circuit current (Isc) of 8.58 μA, and open‐circuit voltage (Voc) of 85.91 V, showcasing excellent electrical performance. The device charged a 1 μF capacitor to 5 V in 36 seconds, delivering a peak power of 178 μW, and maintained stable output with only a 14 % decrease over 60 days. Additionally, the M‐TENG effectively detects and harvests energy from football impacts, generating consistent voltage signals from each interaction, making it a promising candidate for real‐time sports equipment monitoring without the need for an external power source.",

Detailed studies show that the implementation of the functional groups in the [FeFe]‐hydrogenase mimic has marginal impact on the structural, thermodynamic properties, and catalytic performance in the electrochemical proton reduction reaction. However, the modification opens the way for a wide variety of functionalization in the ligand backbone, e.g., for applications in photo/electrocatalysis. Electrochemical investigations reveal that initial two electron reductions are followed by protonation by acetic acid forming an asymmetric diironhydride species. Further reduction of the hydride species and protonation leads to H2 formation. Utilizing foot of the wave analysis, a reaction rate of 2 × 108 s−1 m−1 for the H2 evolution step consisting of the reaction of the metal hydride species and the external acid has been determined. However, catalysis is limited by the formation of the hydride at a rate constant of about 4 × 104 s−1 m−1.",

    "abstract": "Platinum group metal‐free (PGM‐free) catalysts are showing increasing performance and durability and are considered as viable candidates for replacing precious metal‐based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Due to the low intrinsic activity and low active site density, large quantities of the PGM‐free catalysts are needed to obtain high performance. Consequently, the resulting high catalyst loadings induce several interesting and opposing phenomena, namely, lower ORR kinetic losses due to an increase in the number of active sites and much higher mass and charge transport losses. In this work, Fourier‐transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are employed to systematically deconvolute the gains and losses to the activity due to the high loading of PGM‐free catalysts and relate the underlying processes to the observed fuel cell performance. EIS is analyzed via extraction of the distribution of relaxation times, obtaining a model‐free analysis of the physical processes in the cell. Combined with FTacV measurements, the obtained catalyst loading optimum from a mechanistic point of view is explained. The combined use of advanced alternating current techniques for the analysis of operating fuel cells is an important step toward the rational design of the catalyst layer.",

While the activity of these catalysts is widely studied, works addressing stability are less common, especially in neutral or alkaline environments. Therefore, we evaluate a real‐time potential‐dependent dissolution of polycrystalline Ru via scanning flow cell coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in acidic, alkaline, and phosphate buffer electrolytes using relevant potential ranges. On top of the fundamental understanding of Ru's dissolution, a particular focus lies on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its importance in various electrochemical applications. We show that the dissolution behavior of Ru during dynamic operation is well in line with the thermodynamic predictions (except dissolution due to Ru2+ formation) and unique compared to other noble metals (Pt, Au, Ir). While the dissolution of polycrystalline Ru is the highest in alkaline pH at the onset of OER (1.4 VRHE), no stability issues are visible at potentials up to 0.85 VRHE at all pHs. This work establishes a stability baseline for researchers implementing Ru‐based catalysts.",

This preparation process eliminated the need for additional acids and bases, thereby minimizing the generation of waste salts, which was a common issue in base‐catalyzed systems and biosynthesis methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization revealed that a strong interaction between the hydroxyl group of the catalyst and the carbonyl group of MLA facilitated the activation of the substrate for the aldol condensation reaction. Notably, the yield of dicarboxylic acid ester precursors remained stable even after five catalytic cycles, demonstrating the excellent reusability of the catalyst.

The effect of sodium was assessed by using two binders exhibiting different sodium contents. Operando infrared monitoring of the reaction shows that only a portion of the zeolite crystallites is active at short time on stream, which suggests that the inner part of the crystallites does not take part in the catalytic test reaction. The evolution of acidity and activity upon shaping by extrusion is compatible with a model where sodium from the binder heterogeneously poisons the zeolites dominantly at the outer shell of the crystallites.

Proper selection of the AACH and HF ratios enables the synthesis of binary materials with controlled Al₂O₃ and AlF₃ content, as well as tailored textural, structural, and acidic properties.

The gCN/NiO‐3.12%/Pt(IV) heterojunctions, with 1.31 wt% Pt, exhibited the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 132.9 mol H₂ mol Pt−¹ min−¹ in hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis, which is 1.9 times higher than that of gCN/Pt(IV) nanocomposites. The enhanced activity of the gCN/NiO/Pt nanocatalysts can be attributed to the heterojunction formed between gCN and NiO, which facilitates greater visible‐light absorption, more efficient photo‐induced charge separation, and improved charge carrier transfer compared to the gCN/Pt nanocatalysts in photo‐assisted HAB. Reusability tests demonstrated that the gCN/NiO/Pt heterojunction photocatalysts retained 84% of their initial hydrogen generation rate (mL H₂/min) after five consecutive runs of HAB.

    "abstract": "AbstractPurge gas that is by‐produced during syngas conversion contains significant amounts of low carbon alkanes (CH4 and C2H6 in particular), and their flare and release represent one of the major sources of CO2 emission for C1 chemistry. In this context, reforming of the mixed alkanes (RMA) in the purge gas and recycling of the produced syngas can effectively enhance the carbon and hydrogen efficiency of C1 chemistry. However, in‐depth structure‐performance relationships and catalytic mechanisms were rarely investigated for RMA, which forms a major research gap for further development. Herein, a series of Ni–MgO–CeO2 catalysts with different Mg and Ce contents were prepared, and the catalytic performance in reforming of mixed alkanes was investigated. It was found that smaller Ni particles on the Mg‐rich samples (NM6C0 and NM5C1) are more effective for the activation of C2H6. However, the generated CxHy intermediates cannot be converted with matching kinetics, which resulted in the formation of unwanted CH4 and more importantly, larger amounts of carbon deposition. On the other hand, despite a moderate C2H6 conversion is observed on Ce‐rich samples, appropriate balance between the generation of CxHy intermediates from alkanes and their conversion aided by the activated CO2 and H2O can be established, resulting in excellent anticarbon properties. Overall, the optimum catalyst (NM3C3) showed stable CH4 and C2H6 conversion (28% and 43%, respectively) and negligible carbon formation in 100‐h operation. Upon the comparison with individual reforming of CH4 and C2H6, this study also presented in‐depth understanding on the different mechanism and reaction network for reforming of mixed alkanes, which solidifies the foundation of catalyst design in related areas including CO2 utilization or C1 reforming.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis review provides a critical evaluation of the photocatalytic processes that control the efficiency of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and their hybrid composites in notable applications, including pollutant abatement, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon dioxide (CO₂) reduction. TMDCs possess excellent physicochemical characteristics with tuneable bandgaps, large surface area, and intense visible‐light absorption that render them exceptionally competent for initiating photo‐induced redox reactions. The review highlights mechanistic understanding concerning charge carrier generation and separation, defect engineering, and interfacial electron transfer, all of which is a key to improved photocatalytic performance. Particular focus is on pollutant degradation mechanisms, water splitting kinetics, and CO₂ photoreduction mechanisms. Though promising, TMDCs face challenges such as photo‐corrosion, short‐term stability issues, and scale‐up limitations. To overcome these challenges, the formation of heterojunctions with visible‐light‐active semiconductors, such as halide perovskites, is emphasized as a potential method to enhance charge separation and broaden spectral response. Furthermore, the integration of TMDCs with cocatalysts and the design of multicomponent heterostructures are investigated as methods to promote durability and efficiency. This review emphasizes the central role of TMDCs in developing scalable and sustainable photocatalytic systems for environmental and energy applications.",

Recently, many notable FDHs with potential applications in diverse and challenging synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical biosynthesis processes have been reported. Various new FDHs, especially single‐component halogenases with novel functions and mechanisms, can catalyze the halogenation of diverse substrate scaffolds beyond just simple aromatic halogenation. This concept article discusses recent findings obtained over the past 5 years for novel FDHs and highlights important structural and mechanistic insights into single‐component FDH catalysis.

In this study, we present a novel photocatalytic system utilizing the triangulenium dye (N,N′,N′′‐tris(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐triazatriangulenium (TATH) hexafluorophosphate) as the organic photosensitizer, paired with an iron‐quaterpyridine molecular catalyst and BIH/TEOA as sacrificial electron donors. The photocatalytic performance is significantly enhanced through a synergistic electron‐proton relay mechanism between BIH and TEOA, which effectively mitigates charge recombination during CO2 reduction. Operated in a MeCN/NaHCO3 buffer under visible light, this system demonstrates exceptional activity and selectivity for CO production, achieving a turnover number (TON) exceeding 20,000, a quantum yield of 41.6%, and >99% product selectivity. These results surpass benchmark systems employing noble‐metal photosensitizers such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or [Ir(bpy)(ppy)2]+ under identical conditions. Remarkably, both the photosensitizer and catalyst maintain exceptional operational stability by their high individual TONs.

    "abstract": "AbstractNitrogen‐doped carbon (NC)‐supported Mo and Ni–Mo catalysts were synthesized via pyrolysis and impregnation strategies to investigate their performance in methane dry reforming (DRM). By modulating nitrogen content (1.65–13.25 at.%) and speciation (pyridinic/pyrrolic versus graphitic N) in NC supports, we demonstrated that nitrogen functionalities critically influence MoO2 reduction and Mo2C stabilization. Higher N content in NC2 and NC3 enhanced metal‐support interactions, promoting Mo2C formation during H2 reduction, while NC1 (low N) favored metallic Mo. However, under DRM conditions, all catalysts deactivated due to Mo2C oxidation to MoO2, with stability marginally improved at 850 °C via improved “oxidation‐re‐carbonization” cycles. Introducing Ni (5–15 wt.%) via impregnation facilitated CH4 dissociation and lowered MoO2 reduction temperatures through hydrogen spillover, boosting initial CH4/CO2 conversions and H2/CO ratios. Yet, Ni incorporation accelerated carbon support degradation (>50% mass loss) and induced inactive phases (NiO, Ni3Mo3N), offsetting its promotional effects. Combined XRD, H2‐TPR, Raman, and XPS analyses revealed the interplay between N defects, Mo speciation, and Ni–Mo interactions, underscoring the challenges in balancing activity and stability. This study highlights the dual role of nitrogen in stabilizing active phases and the limitations of Ni–Mo bifunctionality under oxidative DRM conditions, providing critical insights for designing robust, carbon‐supported catalysts through defect engineering and structural optimization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In Venus’s mesosphere, the observation/model discrepancy of molecular oxygen, O2, abundance has been a long-standing puzzle. Chlorine atoms have been proposed as a catalyst to oxidize carbon monoxide through the formation of chloroformyl radicals (ClCO), removing O2 and ultimately generating CO2. However, relevant kinetic studies of this catalytic cycle are scarce and highly uncertain. In this work, we report the spectrum of the ClCO radical between 210–520 nm using a multipass UV–Vis spectrometer coupled to a pulsed-laser photolysis flow reactor at 236–294 K temperature and 50–491 Torr pressure ranges. High-level ab initio calculations were performed to simulate the observed spectrum and to investigate the electronic structure. In addition, we observed the formation of molecular chlorine, Cl2, and phosgene, Cl2CO, suggesting that both the terminal chlorine and the central carbon in the ClCO radical are reactive towards chlorine atoms. Most importantly, the reported spectrum will enable future measurements of essential kinetic parameters related to ClCO radicals, which are important in regulating the O2 abundance in Venus’s mesosphere.",

However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, break from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain‐branched dual‐ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3 mW cm‐2. In‐situ ultraviolet‐visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual‐ammonium structure accelerates ~40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high‐energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco‐friendliness, durability, and sustainability.",

However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid‐assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered‐spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered‐spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1 C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26 mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi‐strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.",

    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution of self-replicating entities most likely played a key role in the emergence of life from inanimate matter. For evolution to occur, self-replicators must (1) have structural space accessible to them, (2) occupy only part of it at any time, and (3) navigate it through mutation and selection. We describe a system of self-replicating hexameric macrocycles formed upon the mixing of two building blocks and occupying a subset of possible sequences. Specific interactions, most likely through steric zipper formation, favor a hexamer sequence where the two blocks alternate. Under different replication-destruction regimes, distinct replicator mutants are selected. With non-selective destruction (via outflow), the fastest replicators dominate. With chemically mediated, selective destruction, a mutant that balances replication speed and resistance to reduction by steric zipper formation becomes dominant. This system demonstrates a rudimentary form of Darwinian evolution, where replicators adapt to changing selection pressures through mutation and selection.",

The reaction proceeds instantaneously, even at ‐35 °C, resulting in the quantitative conversion of methylene‐bis‐DTPS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of ∆Gr confirm the synthetic feasibility and regioselectivity, attributing the efficiency to strain release in DTPS rings and entropic gain from thiirane elimination. The resulting 2',3'‐cNTDPs exhibited remarkable hydrolytic stability and greater solution structural rigidity than free nucleosides.",

This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly‐SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly‐SS features linear disulfide‐containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly‐SS demonstrates the exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2‐diketones, achieving >99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly‐SS, enabling facile thin‐film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide‐linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNature's molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light‐driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light‐driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric‐driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light‐induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light‐driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOrganic synthesis uniquely provides opportunities to access molecules that serve defined purposes. Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late‐stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy‐level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site‐selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group. Examples of functionalization using alkyne hydroamination, Curtius reaction, and alkene metathesis are highlighted along with the use of the prodrugs for biological applications.",

The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d‐d transitions and possible metal‐to‐metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared (NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV–cut off (85–90%), which indicates possible use as UV‐NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3–5 times higher than KDP. The dielectric studies indicated reasonable values for the dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long‐term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations, which support the findings of the experimental investigations. The present study clearly indicates that it is profitable to explore mineral structures as hosts toward new colored compounds, substitution of transition elements that result not only in new and also for application as electrocatalysts through careful band engineering.",

The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one‐pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one‐pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one‐pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of robust chiroptical systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2‐symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five‐fold enhancement of the g‐factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine‐tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high‐performance chiroptical materials.",

The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P═Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt.

Herein, novel reductive carbon dots (r‐CDs) were successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that r‐CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r‐CDs exhibit remarkable preservation effects on apples and strawberries and significantly extend their shelf‐life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon‐core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process. More interestingly, the reducibility of r‐CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N‐doped CDs (N‐CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material‐controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development of non‐toxic, efficient carbon nano‐antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material‐controlled synthesis.",

An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the “best” reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning models. In addition, comparing the machine learning models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi‐catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.",

The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(η3‐P4R2L)]+ (1a – d) and [Cp'''Ni(η1:1‐P4R2L)]+ (3a – d) show different geometries for the L‐P3PR2 ligands.

Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(η2‐IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by the reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso‐tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies shed light upon the fundamental principles, which differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}– transition metal units.

    "abstract": "AbstractHere, we report a novel strategy for the first time: bench‐stable N‐sulfonyl imidazoliums were used as the robust and versatile coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents. Fast reactions of N‐sulfonyl imidazoliums with carboxylic acids or phosphodiesters formed carboxylic acid‐sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides and phospho‐sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides, respectively, and the subsequent treatments of the highly active intermediates with the corresponding nucleophilic partners in the presence of imidazoles at room temperature provided amides, dipeptides, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters (almost without racemization during the formation of amides, dipeptides, esters, thioesters), phosphamides, and phosphoesters in high to excellent yields. This kind of N‐sulfonyl imidazolium as the coupling reagent was successfully applied in solid phase synthesis of a polypeptide containing 32 amino acid residues. This strategy was effectively extended to the construction of glycosides, and high steroselectivity and good yields were provided. In addition, reactions of N‐sulfonyl imidazoliums with amines or alcohols afforded the corresponding sulfonamides and sulfonates in excellent yields. This study should provide a highly efficient, economical, and practical strategy for construction of diverse molecules.",

    "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as effective photocatalysts for the environmentally friendly synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under solar sunlight. Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene‐linked COFs termed g‐TDM‐COF and g‐TBD‐COF, respectively.  The methoxyl substituents pended on the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over 8‐fold enhancement of photocatalytic H2O2 production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500 nm. Such phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen‐bond interaction, thus favorable for broading light‐harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity, As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.",

Currently, oil‐soluble nanoparticles represent an under‐researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesizing organic nanoparticles with higher‐order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil‐soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self‐assembly of polyester‐based BCPs in n‐octane to achieve low‐dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tunable, oil‐soluble polymers and aims to understand their self‐assembly in n‐octane through the variation of self‐assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.",

Despite such interest, acceptable results were obtained only by modifying the norbornadiene‐quadricyclane (NBD‐QC) system, still leaving key issues unsolved. Here, we have designed a full storage‐release MOST cycle based on the Paternò‐Büchi reaction, potentially offering a class of compounds with a significantly higher storage density than NBD‐QC. Based on the experimental evidence concerning the viability of their synthesis and photoreactivity, we have repurposed those compounds by computationally elucidating the substitution pattern effects on low‐energy isomer’s light absorption, followed by high‐energy isomer’s photoproduction, including singlet and triplet states involved by the Paternò‐Büchi type of reactivity. The thermal conversion back to the initial isomer to release the stored energy was also studied, including a sustainable option by taking advantage of enzymatic activity.",

Nevertheless, the direct formation of C3 products encounters significant limitations due to the C2–C1 coupling reaction, posing a considerable challenge to improving their faradaic efficiency. Here, we present a design for an elevated pressure cascade catalytic reactor to convert CO2 to C3 products in a two‐step electrochemical process. At 25 bar pressure, by regulating the potential of the cascade system and the electrolyte flow rate we report a 40% selectivity for 2‐propanol on a copper electrode placed upstream of a silver electrode that converts CO2 to CO. In cascade mode (with both silver and copper electrodes active), the C3:C2 oxygenate ratio significantly increases to 7 compared to the non‐cascade mode (copper only) with a modest ratio of about 0.6. Thereby, our elevated pressure cascade electrolysis approach demonstrates a notable step forward in CO2 electroreduction to oxygenated C3 products.",

    "abstract": "Cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX₃, X=I, Br or their mixture) have emerged as a type of promising photovoltaic material due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, thermal stability and low cost. Despite the great progress achieved in the corresponding photovoltaic devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags far behind their theoretical limit. Comparing with the obtained high current density and fill factor, it is of great potential for increasing the open‐circuit voltage (Voc) value as the Voc loss of the CsPbX3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still quite significant considering their wide bandgap. The primary mechanisms of Voc loss involve non‐radiative recombination driven by bulk defects, interfacial defects and energy level mismatching. To address the above issues, numerous strategies have been investigated including additive engineering, interface modification, charge transport layer replacement, etc. Herein, this review summarizes the most recent work on mitigating Voc loss of CsPbX3 PSCs from three aspects, namely bulk film optimization, interface regulation and transport layer optimization, and gives a brief outlook on how to promote the Voc further. With this, a guideline is provided for researchers engaging in developing CsPbX3 PSCs with high photovoltaic performance.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the development of suitable cocatalysts represents an effective strategy. Cocatalysts can interact with photocatalysts to improve light absorption capabilities and facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, they provide highly active surface sites that promote the adsorption and activation of CO2, which leads to acceleration of photocatalytic reduction. Herein, WO3 is employed as a cocatalyst to promote the CO2 photoreduction performance of a g-C3N4-TiO2 heterojunction through a facile and scalable calcination method. In pure water, optimal WO3/g-C3N4-TiO2 (WCT) delivers high selectivity CO and CH4 formation of 48.31 µmol·g−1 and 77.18 µmol·g−1 in the absence of a sacrificial reagent and extra photosensitizer, roughly 13.9 and 45.7 times higher than that of g-C3N4-TiO2 (CT). WO3 can strongly interact with g-C3N4-TiO2 electronically, guiding electrons across the interface to the surface. The oxygen vacancies in WO3, as electron-enriched centers, not only enhance charge separation and form efficient charge transfer channels but also capture photogenerated electrons to suppress charge recombination. This strong interaction and oxygen vacancies in WO3 jointly improve photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, offering a feasible way to design efficient cocatalysts.",

For the search, MeSH and DECS terms were employed in the PubMed, Scopus, and SciELO databases. Research has shown that plant extracts derived from plants of the genus Tabebuia exhibit potential applications in the search for new molecules with antiproliferative activity. Among the isolated molecules, the most evaluated correspond to β-lapachone (naphthoquinone); however, molecules with antiproliferative potential belonging to groups such as iridoids, flavonoids, quinones, furanonaphthoquinones, triterpenes, and polysaccharides have also been isolated and reported. Additionally, synthesized molecules have been evaluated on the basis of the modifications made to the structures of molecules isolated from the plant extracts to increase their activity, aiming to develop more potent antitumor agents for future clinical use.",

Through numerical simulations, we analyze the motion of particles from a reflecting boundary to an absorbing one. Properties of diffusive motion are explored by inspection of mean squared displacement and mean first passage time. The results show that the diffusion type depends on the drift strength. Without the drift, entropic forces induce effective superdiffusion; however, the increasing drift strength can counterbalance entropic forces and shift the system to standard diffusion and then effective subdiffusion. The mean squared displacement exhibits bending points for high drift values, as predicted by one-dimensional theoretical considerations. The study underscores the importance of considering deterministic and entropic forces in confined geometries.",

Therefore, a machine learning-based suspect screening combined with target screening was employed to comprehensively identify and quantify both legacy and novel PFASs in drinking water from the Yangtze River Delta, and their potential sources of contamination were determined through pollutant profile analysis. A total of 30 PFASs were identified, including 16 legacy and 14 novel PFASs, categorized into 11 classes.

    "abstract": "This study presents a sustainable, environmentally friendly synthetic route for the production of key intermediates in losartan using palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) derived from a brown seaweed, Sargassum incisifolium, as a recyclable nanocatalyst. A key intermediate, biaryl, was synthesized with an excellent yield (98%) via Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between 2-bromobenzonitrile and 4-methylphenylboronic acid, catalyzed using bio-derived PdNPs under mild conditions. Subsequent bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) under LED light, followed by imidazole coupling and tetrazole ring formation, allowed for the production of losartan with an overall yield of 27%. The PdNP catalyst exhibited high stability and recyclability, as well as strong catalytic activity, even at lower loadings, and nitrosamine formation was not detected. While the overall yield was lower than that of traditional industrial methods, this was due to the deliberate avoidance of the use of toxic reagents, hazardous solvents, and protection/deprotection steps commonly used in conventional routes. This trade-off marks a shift in pharmaceutical process development, where environmental and safety considerations are increasingly prioritized in line with green chemistry and regulatory frameworks. This study provides a foundation for green scaling up strategies, incorporating sustainability principles into drug synthesis.",

These polymers are essential in the advancement of drug delivery systems (DDSs) that facilitate the gradual drug release over a predetermined duration. Therefore, this study introduces the novel use of a diethyl zinc/propyl gallate catalytic system to synthesize glycolide/ε-caprolactone copolymers (PGCL) for subsequent biomedical applications. A total of twenty-four biodegradable copolymeric matrices, characterized by a highly random microstructure and an average molecular weight (Mn) ranging from approximately 27 to 62 kDa, were synthesized and analyzed. The resulting copolymer samples underwent Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) and Umu tests, revealing no signs of cyto- or genotoxicity. Furthermore, a hemolysis assay was conducted on selected samples, indicating their suitability for intravenous administration. Finally, a release study of paclitaxel (PACL) from one of the synthesized matrices demonstrated a sustained and highly controlled drug release profile, following first-order kinetics and the Fickian diffusion mechanism.",

The adsorption breakthrough performance of the single-component SO2 or H2S was determined in the activated carbon fixed-bed test. Langmuir and extended Langmuir equations in the Aspen adsorption module were used to describe the adsorption equilibrium of the single and bi-component SO2 and H2S system, respectively. The effects of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and temperature on the dynamic adsorption process of the bi-component SO2/H2S system were investigated. The concentration distribution and adsorption capacity of SO2/H2S in the bed were simulated. The results showed that the simulation for the single-component breakthrough curves of SO2 or H2S agreed well with the experimental data. It indicated that the model and simulation yielded engineering acceptable accuracy. For the bi-component adsorption, the competitive adsorption effect was observed, with H2S as the weakly adsorbed component and SO2 as the strongly adsorbed component. The dynamic adsorption process showed the sequence of initial adsorption, breakthrough, replacement, and equilibrium. The breakthrough curves were characterized by the distinct hump (roll-up) for H2S, resulting from the replacement effect. The influence of GHSV and the temperature on the dynamic adsorption process were investigated, revealing that the lower velocity and temperature enhanced the adsorption. This work might be used for the design and optimization of adsorption bed for the simultaneous removal of SO2 and H2S in Claus tail gas.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin E is widely used in cosmetics and dermatological applications for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties, yet its industrial use is limited by poor stability and bioavailability. To address these challenges, this study developed zein-based microstructures encapsulating vitamin E using electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques and evaluated how zein concentration affects morphology and release behavior. The SEM analysis showed that biopolymer (zein) concentration significantly affects microstructure morphology. At low concentrations (1%, 5%, and 15% (w/v)), micro/nanoparticles are formed, and high concentrations (30% (w/v)) yielded only fibers. The average size of the structures produced with zein (1–15% w/v) ranged from 0.38 to 0.90 µm, as measured using the program ImageJ (v1.54d). Structures containing vitamin E were generally smaller than those without. For electrospun fibers made with 30% zein, diameters ranged from 0.49 to 0.74 µm, with vitamin E-containing fibers also being thinner. Conductivity also influenced morphology; higher conductivity developed fibers, while lower conductivity formed particles. The solution with 15% (w/v) zein + 1% (w/w) vitamin E showed a conductivity of 1276 μS, similar to the 15% zein solution (1280 μS), indicating that vitamin E addition had no significant effect on conductivity. Release assays revealed that structures produced with low zein concentrations led to immediate release, while structured made with higher concentrations, prolonged release. A preliminary cosmetic formulation test has been conducted. The vitamin E microstructures were successfully incorporated into aloe vera hydrogel and coconut oil to show their potential for cosmetic applications.",

The objective of this review was to compile the latest advances in the development of computational models capable of identifying drugs already registered by the Food and Drug Administration for other indications with potential capacity to be applied as antimicrobials. We present studies that apply in silico methods such as machine learning, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and deep learning.

In addition, we present the methods that are under development and their future prospects in terms of the search for new antimicrobials.

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive technique—used for the local eradication of neoplastic cells—that exploits the interaction of light, oxygen, and a photo-responsive drug called photosensitizer (PS) for the local generation of lethal ROS. Push-pull chromophores, that bear electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups linked through a π-electron bridge, are characterized by a non-homogeneous charge distribution in their excited state, with charge transfer from one extremity of the chain to the other one (Internal Charge Transfer—ICT). This phenomenon has a direct impact on the photophysical features of the push-pull compounds, as the bathochromic shift of the emission maxima and intersystem crossing (ISC) of the excited state are directly connected with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In continuing our research regarding the synthesis and use of oligophenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) in PDT, two new push-pull glycosyl OPE-NOF and OPE-ONF—featuring electron-donor N,N-dimethylamino (N) and dimetoxyaryl (O) and acceptor tetrafluoroaryl (F) moieties on the OPE chain—have been efficiently prepared. The interchanged position of the D groups onto the conjugated skeleton was aimed to tune and optimize the push-pull effect, while the introduction of glucoside terminations was directed to give biocompatibility and bioaffinity to the chromophores. OPE-NOF, OPE-ONF, and the synthetic intermediates were fully characterized, and their photophysical properties were investigated by using UV-Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. OPE-NOF showed a strong charge-transfer character and high PDT effect on HeLa cancer cells when irradiated with non-harmful blue light, causing massive cancer cell death.",

    "abstract": "Quercetin (QUE) is a bioactive flavonoid that is naturally present in various fruits and possesses many pharmacological activities. Despite its health benefits, the bioavailability of quercetin is relatively low due to its crystalline form and hydrophobic structure. An approach to overcoming these drawbacks is its incorporation into amorphous polymer matrices. PLA and PLA/PEG fibrous materials loaded with QUE were obtained by electrospinning. The XRD analysis revealed a visible decrease in the crystallinity of QUE after its incorporation into PLA and PLA/PEG fibers. The obtained fibrous materials and, especially, the PLA/PEG mat loaded with the flavonoid exhibited high antioxidant activity due to the better wettability and higher release rate of the bioactive compound. Moreover, the PLA/QUE and PLA/PEG/QUE mats possessed antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, the antitumor activity of the prepared mats was tested against SH-4 cancer cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. The obtained results reveal that the QUE-loaded fibrous mats exhibited high anticancer activity against cancer cells but lower toxicity to normal keratinocytes. The combined antioxidant, antibacterial and in vitro antitumor activities render these novel PLA-based materials loaded with QUE promising candidates for wound dressing applications and for application in local tumor treatment.",

Theoretical thermodynamic results were compared with experimental data obtained from conductometric studies. Our findings indicated that all three cyclodextrins form stable 1:1 inclusion complexes with dacarbazine. Among them, the complexes with HE-β-CD were the most thermodynamically stable. While the choice of solvent model had a minor impact on the structural properties of the complexes, it significantly affected thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and solvation free energy. The best agreement with experimental data—particularly for the Gibbs free energy of solvation—was observed when using the SMD model.",

This study evaluates the application of Fourier Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric models—Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR)—for rapid, non-destructive assessment of key MOL parameters: density, total lime content, calcium oxide availability, and sucrose content. Ninety samples were analyzed using both wet chemistry and FT-NIR. The predictive performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2). High predictive accuracy was observed for density (PLS: R2 = 0.8274; PCR: R2 = 0.8795) and calcium oxide availability (PLS: R2 = 0.9035; PCR: R2 = 0.9115). Total lime content showed moderate accuracy (PLS: R2 = 0.7748; PCR: R2 = 0.7983), while sucrose content exhibited low predictive power (PLS: R2 = 0.2312; PCR: R2 = 0.3747). The weak performance was noted for %CaO (PLS: R2 = 0.4893; PCR: R2 = 0.2409), likely due to spectral overlap and matrix complexity. Despite these challenges, FT-NIR remains a viable, reagent-free method for monitoring MOL, with the potential to enhance process control in the sugar industry. Future work should focus on refining calibration strategies and addressing spectral interferences to improve predictive accuracy for complex matrices.",

The objective of the study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of commercial essential oils derived from clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.)

The essential oils showed significant antibiofilm activity against A. acidoterrestris isolates, with the efficiency of biofilm eradication depending on the strain and environmental parameters such as acidity, culture temperature, type, and concentration of essential oil. The greatest antibiofilm potential was observed for clove essential oil regardless of oil concentrations and environmental conditions. Cinnamon oil exhibited lower activity against the tested A. acidoterrestris strains. Peppermint essential oil showed the weakest antibiofilm ability and did not completely eradicate any strain biofilm of the tested strains. Clove and cinnamon essential oils have the potential to be effective alternatives to synthetic disinfectants directed against A. acidoterrestris grown in the form of biofilms.",

The efficiency of the osmotic dehydration process was assessed by analyzing its kinetic parameters. In selected samples of osmotically dehydrated fruits, physicochemical properties were evaluated, including dry matter content, total acidity, pH, sugar profile, color attributes, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity (measured by DPPH and ABTS assays), and vitamin C content. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the relationships among the measured variables and to identify underlying patterns within the dataset. Osmotic dehydration in xylitol significantly modified the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of apples, promoting substantial water loss and partial replacement of natural sugars with xylitol. The results showed that ultrasound pretreatment markedly influenced these effects, with treatment duration playing a critical role. Shorter ultrasound applications (15–30 min) enhanced xylitol uptake while better preserving antioxidant activity and color, whereas longer ultrasound treatments (45 min) achieved greater mass transfer but led to higher losses of bioactive compounds compared to untreated samples.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment remains a critical area of research. In this study, we investigated the potential of molecular hybridization to enhance the anticancer activity of existing molecules with previous demonstrated activity. In this sense, a series of hybrids combining key pharmacophores (melatonin and coumarin) were synthesized for the first time and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic/spectrometric techniques. To verify if this strategy improves biological potential, compounds were evaluated in SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Our results demonstrated that hybrid 3f exhibited activity comparable to conventional chemotherapy with 5‐Fluorouracil (GI50‐3f = 30.12 ± 2.12 µM; GI50‐5FU = 28.83 ± 3.61 µM), suggesting it could be a promising alternative for cancer drug research. Notably, the hybrids 3e and 3f displayed significantly higher inhibition percentages against this cell line regarding parental compounds, even causing total growth inhibition and a certain grade of lethality, highlighting the efficacy of molecular hybridization in potentiating biological effects. In addition, a theoretical examination of pharmacokinetics, toxicological, and drug‐like characteristics indicates that the most promising hybrid, 3f, has a good chance of advancing to additional preclinical studies. Our findings showed that melatonin‐coumarin conjugates are effective, with the 2‐hydroxyphenyl‐substituted conjugate serving as a prototype for further drug investigations addressed to combat colorectal malignant carcinoma (CRC). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential of coumarin/melatonin hybrids against cancer, emphasizing the need for further studies to optimize their activity and explore underlying mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this research, a glassy carbon electrode modified with cerium oxide nanoparticles was used to study the electrochemical behavior and determination of caffeine. For this purpose, the surface of the electrode was modified by electrochemical precipitation of cerium oxide at a temperature of 60 °C. The effect of different parameters, such as temperature, electrodeposition potential, pH, buffer type, and concentration of cerium in the preparation of the electrochemical sensor were investigated. Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles were also characterized by different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Increasing the current and minimizing the over potential of caffeine on the glassy carbon electrode modified with cerium oxide nanoparticles are the main advantage of the designed sensor. Under optimal conditions, the oxidation peak currents were proportional to caffeine concentration in the range of 10–368 µM with a low detection limit of 2.9 µM. The modified CeO2/GC electrode has high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and a larger active surface area than a bare glassy carbon electrode and fast response. Finally, the analytical efficiency of the proposed modified electrode was evaluated for the determination of caffeine in some real samples.",

In this study, nanoscaled ZnO NPs (denoted as sn‐ZnO NPs) were synthesized under ambient conditions using a biomimetic approach with Sambucus nigra (black elderberry) fruit extract as a natural reducing and capping agent, and zinc acetate dihydrate as the precursor. Morphological, structural, and optical characterizations including FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, and UV–visible spectroscopy confirmed the successful synthesis of hexagonal wurtzite‐structured nanoparticles with an average size of 53 ± 10 nm. The influence of calcination temperatures (500–700 °C) on the structural and optical properties of the nanoparticles was systematically examined. Higher calcination temperatures increased crystallite size and bandgap energy ranging from 1.67 eV (as‐synthesized) to 2.67 eV (700 °C). The nanoparticles demonstrated significant in vitro anticancer activity against SH‐SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with the 600 °C sample exhibiting the highest cytotoxicity achieving an IC50 value of 9.48 µg/mL. These eco‐friendly, biocompatible sn‐ZnO NPs with tunable structural and optical properties demonstrate strong potential for biomedical applications particularly in targeted cancer therapy and lay a foundation for further research into their use in diverse biomedical and environmental fields.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTransition metal oxides such as nickel oxide (NiO) have garnered significant attention for supercapacitor applications due to their high surface area and excellent chemical stability. In this study, NiO nanocrystals were successfully synthesized using four different concentrations of NaOH (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M), yielding samples designated as NiO‐A, NiO‐B, NiO‐C, and NiO‐D, respectively. The structural and morphological characteristics of the synthesized samples were thoroughly investigated. Among them, NiO‐A exhibited superior crystallinity, as confirmed by X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that NaOH concentration significantly influenced the morphology of the nanocrystals. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of Ni in the + 2‐oxidation state in NiO‐A. Electrochemical performance was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge‐discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). NiO‐A demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 165 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, attributed to its large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 462 m2/g, pore volume of 0.49 cc/g, and low charge transfer resistance of 65.13 Ω. Additionally, GCD analysis revealed an energy density of 3.2 Wh/kg at a power density of 1870 W/kg, highlighting NiO‐A's potential as a promising electrode material for high‐performance supercapacitors.",

This phosphinonitronyl nitroxide was prepared by reacting lithiated nitronyl nitroxide with 8‐bromo‐1,3,5,7‐tetramethyl‐2,4,6‐trioxa‐8‐phosphaadamantane. The paramagnet was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electron spin resonance (ESR), infrared, and UV/vis spectroscopy supported by quantum chemical calculations. Molecular and crystal structure of the phosphinonitronyl nitroxide was established by X‐ray structural analysis. ESR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved spin delocalization onto the phosphorus atom. According to the cyclic‐voltammetry data, oxidation of the phosphinonitronyl nitroxide takes place quasi‐reversibly at E1/2 = 0.76 V, and its reduction occurs chemically and electrochemically reversibly at E1/2 = −0.95 V (rel.

Comprehensive characterization techniques, including FT‐IR, XRD, TGA, BET, FESEM, and XPS, confirmed the successful formation and structural features of the composite. The adsorption performance of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 for uranium(VI) removal from aqueous solutions was systematically investigated using batch experiments. The composite exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics and reached equilibrium within 60 min for an initial U(VI) concentration of 25 mg/L at pH 6.0. The adsorption performance of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 demonstrates a superior adsorption capacity of 370.3 mg g‐1, as described by the Langmuir isotherm model, compared to previously reported similar nanomaterials and nanocomposite adsorbents. The enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic interactions between the U(VI) species and the surface functional groups (amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl) of Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2. Thermodynamic studies revealed that uranium adsorption on Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 increased with increasing temperature. The composite demonstrated a higher affinity in the presence of competing electrolytes and various metal ions, exhibited excellent regeneration using dilute nitric acid, and maintained its adsorption efficiency over multiple cycles. These results establish Ac‐gC3N4@TSS‐TiO2 as a sustainable and high‐performance adsorbent for U(VI) remediation in real‐world water treatment applications.",

In this study, in situ PCN with various compositions of m‐Kaol with styrene and anionic acrylic acid were synthesized and characterized. PCN formed with 60:40 molar ratio of the monomers with m‐Kaol showed self‐assembly in THF into giant vesicles of 1.5–3.0 µm diameter and wall thickness of 50–70 nm, attributed to the functionalization‐induced bilayer assembly of the delaminated, m‐Kaol, Janus nanoparticles by hydrogen bonding involving terminal ─OH groups along the core and stabilized by the π─π interactions of the phenyl moiety along the periphery. Aliphatic rhodamine dye‐encapsulated vesicles showed no release in pH 4.0 indicating the hydrogen bonded carboxyl groups in the corona. Sustained delivery was observed at pH 7.4, attributed to the limited deprotonation leading to diffusion‐controlled release. The vesicles eroded completely at pH 9.0 due to the collapse of the hydrogen bonding. The results showed prospects for applications of these rigid, designer hybrid vesicles which are nontoxic and cost‐effective as pH‐sensitive delivery systems in the gastrointestinal tract or as scaffolds for topical delivery.",

Obtained through a streamlined fabrication process and calcination at variable temperatures, the material underwent distinct structural alterations. Characterization analyses indicated the emergence of a porous architecture, facilitating robust Ag+ ion adsorption. Among the variants studied, materials calcined at 150 °C demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The integration of CaSiO3 into the Ag/TiO2 matrix resulted in the formation of Ag/TiO2@CaSiO3. This composite amalgamates the immediate antibacterial efficacy of Ag+ ions with the enduring antibacterial functionality of Ag/TiO2, additionally augmenting antibacterial performance through reactive oxygen species generation. Owing to its remarkable antibacterial attributes, the Ag/TiO2@CaSiO3 composite is a promising candidate for addressing infection control challenges in medical settings.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), continues to be a major global health burden, particularly with the alarming rise of multi‐drug‐resistant (MDR) and extensively drug‐resistant (XDR) strains that compromise the efficacy of conventional therapies. Hence, we designed a new set of spirooxindole‐ and spiroindenoquinoxaline‐derived pyrrolo[3,4‐c] pyrroles that have been synthesized through atom economic one‐pot multicomponent reactions of isatin/indenoquinoxaline and phenylalanine to form an azomethine ylide with maleimide derivatives as dipolarophiles through 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of azomethine ylides. The newly synthesized compounds were structurally characterized using FT‐IR, ¹H, and ¹3C NMR spectroscopy, and their stereochemistry was unambiguously confirmed through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations of selected compounds (4b and 5a) revealed favorable binding interactions with the Mtb enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl‐β‐D‐ribofuranose oxidoreductase, suggesting their potential role in inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. In vitro anti‐tubercular activity was evaluated using the MABA assay against the H37Rv strain, with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol as positive controls. Among the synthesized analogs (4a–4d, 5a–5d), compounds 4d and 5d, bearing a 4‐chloro substituent, showed the most potent activity (12.5 µg/mL), while others exhibited notable inhibitory effects, indicating strong therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo achieve efficient electrocatalytic alkaline hydrogen evolution (HER), novel preparation methods for dual‐transition metal nitrides, with dense g‐C3N4/transition metal nitride interface, should be proposed. Herein, a novel g‐C3N4 layer‐coated CoN‐MoN fiber electrocatalyst was prepared on Co foam (CF) via thermopolymerization nitriding strategy. During the fabrication process, CoN‐MoN fiber was prepared facilely on CF, and, meanwhile, a g‐C3N4 layer was successfully coated on CoN‐MoN fiber. The synthesized electrocatalyst (g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF) exhibits a low overpotential of 138 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope (89 mV dec−1) during alkaline HER. The high water splitting capacity could be attributed to the special g‐C3N4 coating structure on the CoN‐MoN fiber. From DFT calculation, an obvious electron transfer occurred at the g‐C3N4/CoN‐MoN interface, which not only improves the hydrolytic dissociation ability but also optimizes its Gibbs free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*). Compared with the ΔGH* of g‐C3N4 and CoN‐MoN/CF, g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF showed a suitable ΔGH* of −2.97 eV, which is relatively close to the ideal ΔGH* (0 eV). Moreover, the H─O─H bond angle of adsorbed water on g‐C3N4@CoN‐MoN/CF increased to 105.47°, and the H─O bond was extended to 1.009 Å, which facilitates the breaking of the H─O bond, thus reducing H* to H2.",

We observed that effective interaction of NaC in Pluronic P123 at different temperatures (2–25 °C) reduces the overall fluorescence intensity of 1‐NaP. However, the sol to gel transition temperature remains unaffected in presence NaC at low concentration. MCR‐ALS analysed fluorescence spectra of 1‐NaP indicated that the relative contribution of anionic peak increases and neutral peak decreases in presence of NaC in Pluronic P123. This is due to the fact that hydration in the Pluronic P123 microenvironment increases by the charged interfacial region of NaC. Fluorescence life time data suggested that 1‐NaP is distributed mostly in polymer‐water interface and core region of Pluronic P123 experiencing relatively polar microenvironment with restricted diffusive motion.",

Zn nanoparticles facilitated intermediate 5 formation, and SeO₂ was used for oxidation. Structures were confirmed via 1H NMR, and 13C NMR, verifying the chalcone moiety and E‐configuration. Cytotoxicity screening revealed six active compounds (11a, 11b, 11c, 11d, 11i, 11j), with 11b (3,4,5‐trimethoxyphenyl) showing the highest potency (IC50: 0.03–0.42 µM). SAR analysis indicated electron‐donating groups enhanced activity. Comparisons with known anticancer drugs validated the efficacy of 11b. Preliminary mechanistic studies, including apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest assays, provided insights into its mode of action. Selectivity assays assessed toxicity against normal cell lines.

Efficient synthetic methods are important in ligand development for fast and cost‐effective synthesis of transition metal complexes commonly used as catalysts in various applications. Traditional methods for forming C–N and C–C bonds require long reaction times and harsh conditions, whereas microwave heating accelerates synthesis by significantly reducing time and temperature, under metal‐ and additive‐free conditions. This has enabled the selective synthesis of mono‐ and di‐substituted pyridine‐based ligand synthons starting from 2,6‐dibromopyridine as well as 2,6‐dichloropyridine. The approach also applies to other pyridine‐based substrates, delivering high‐purity ligands in 5–15 min. Notably, this method provides an alternative approach to cross‐coupling reactions, eliminating the requirement for copper catalysts, and provides a more sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional cross‐coupling strategies. The ligand synthons prepared using the microwave‐assisted approach reported here have been utilized to prepare some common ligands used in the preparation of organometallic complexes.",

However, information about the biodegradability of PEF is currently lacking, and further studies under realistic natural conditions are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the biodegradability of PEF. In this study, we first demonstrated that PEF is marine biodegradable based on the results of laboratory tests using the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) test method using seawater at the coast of Osaka Bay, Japan. BOD tests revealed a 40% biodegradation of PEF within 90 days. The BOD curve followed a sigmoidal pattern, indicating an initial induction period. This behavior, typical of biodegradable polymers, suggests the presence of enzymes and bacteria capable of hydrolyzing PEF. Additionally, adjusting the length of the methylene chain in furan‐containing polyesters can regulate their biodegradability. These findings hold promise for developing biodegradable polymer building blocks and advancing biobased, biodegradable polymer technology.",

The OER outcomes of Complex 1 exhibit excellent performance, featuring a lower overpotential of 220 mV and reduced Tafel slope value of 82 mV dec−1 at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH compared to Complex 2. Additionally, the results of UOR indicate that Complex 1 only requires 1.30 V potential to achieve the same current density which is significantly lower than other counterparts and most reported materials.

    "abstract": "Functionalized quinones are crucial structural building blocks for synthesizing significant biologically active compounds. The selective catalytic oxidation of low‐valent oxygen precursors (including aromatic compounds, phenolic derivatives and hydroquinone analogues) has been widely recognized as one of the most economically and environmentally favorable approaches for producing functionalized quinones. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as versatile inorganic clusters, have attracted much attention in multidisciplinary fields, especially in catalysis, due to their adjustable structural configuration and acid‐base properties, excellent redox properties, as well as remarkable thermal stability, chemical stability and hydrolysis stability. As a pivotal branch, POM‐based heterogeneous catalytic systems not only preserve the inherent highly active sites of POMs, but also establish synergistic catalytic networks through the integration of hybrid components. This paves a new way for achieving material recyclability and green catalytic technology. This review presents a critical analysis of research advances in POM‐based heterogeneous catalysts for quinone synthesis over recent decades and systematically proposes optimization strategies from the perspective of material design principles and catalytic processes, aiming to offer molecular engineering theoretical support for the construction of a new generation of catalytic platform.",

The molecular structures and properties of the products were elucidated by X‐ray crystallographic analysis, UV‐vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. Dibenzo[b,e]phosphindolizines with p‐(diphenylamino)phenyl and diphenylamino groups have smaller HOMO−LUMO gaps and higher HOMO energy levels than derivatives with methoxy and trifluoromethyl groups and without an amino group. The substituent effects were also investigated by theoretical calculations.",

Enhancing the NLO performance of these materials is essential to meet the growing demands in applications such as optical modulation and communication. Interestingly, twisted structures have been shown to alter NLO properties, offering a novel design approach. This review systematically examines recent advances in twisted D‐π‐A type organic chromophores for enhancing NLO performance, with a particular focus on the key mechanisms of molecular structure design and performance optimization. It provides a detailed discussion of the design strategies aimed at improving the NLO performance of twisted organic chromophores, highlighting the significance of twisted structures and electronic group design. The literature review indicates that optimizing twist angles, strengthening donor and acceptor group intensities, and optimizing π‐conjugated bridges are effective ways to enhance NLO performance.",

Among these, the use of boron‐containing compounds as electron donors or acceptors in EDA complexes has garnered significant attention due to their unique properties.

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the photophysical, electroluminescence, and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties of two solution‐processable fluorescent diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives is reported. Photophysical measurements are carried out in solution and blend films containing a 4,4′‐bis(N‐carbazolyl)‐1,10‐biphenyl (CBP) or a poly[(9,9‐di‐n‐octylfluorenyl‐2,7‐diyl)‐alt‐(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol‐4,8‐diyl)] host, to gain important insights into the excited state behavior of these dyes. Quantum chemical calculations are also carried out to support the experimental findings. An optimization of the doping concentration in the CBP blends is necessary to reduce the strong aggregation. This optimization led for both near‐infrared‐emitting dyes to a substantial increase of the photoluminescence quantum yield, which can reach values as high as 60%. It is also found that the blend films show excellent ASE properties with a threshold as low as 3.5–4.5 μJ cm−2 for peak wavelengths of 739 and 727 nm. In addition, the electroluminescence properties of the two organic laser dyes are examined in organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best OLED device shows a maximum external quantum efficiency value of around 2%. Overall, this study demonstrates the excellent potential of diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives for high‐performance near‐infrared organic semiconductor lasers and provides useful information for the design of new efficient near‐infrared emitters for optoelectronic applications.",

Designing chiral materials with enhanced properties requires a deep understanding of underlying physical principles, often revealed only through large datasets. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful tool for accelerating discovery and optimization, efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces. This work explores the synergy between AI and chiroptical properties, highlighting recent advances in data‐driven approaches for circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence. AI has demonstrated its ability to predict these phenomena accurately while uncovering structure–property relationships that can remain hidden under traditional methods. Various strategies are examined for integrating AI into chiroptical properties and the challenges and future directions of this field are discussed. In conclusion, combining chemical intuition with AI offers great potential for the rational design of next‐generation chiral materials. This integration not only promises to unlock novel compounds with enhanced chiroptical properties but also provides new opportunities to deepen our understanding of chiroptical phenomena.",

Gold Teaching and learning methods Undergraduates We can all remember back to our first forays into research. It was a process filled with wonder and confusion as we departed from the safe territory of problems with known solutions to the unknown world of asking (and trying to answer) entirely new questions. The experience was both empowering, showing us all the knowledge we have gained throughout our education, and deeply humbling as we struggled to apply this knowledge in different ways.One of the biggest challenges that new researchers face is the gap between the textbook level understanding they have gained in their coursework and the ways that these topics are pursued in cutting edge research in the field. This gap has undoubtedly always existed as no textbook can be entirely comprehensive or eternally up to date, but we have the sense that this gap has been widening in recent years. The gap is certainly large in interdisciplinary fields, where traditional courses or even entire study programs will not cover the range of topics required to be proficient in the field. But it seems that the gap is also widening in traditional disciplines as the publish or perish culture that has pervaded academia preferentially rewards output of top-level research articles over undergraduate textbooks.From the educational side, we can see the problem being addressed with an increasing shift toward research-based teaching, but we can also see that research-based teaching can and should be supported by a different style of publication tailored to these emerging researchers. Be they newly embarked on their research career or established researchers moving into new domains, all will benefit from a practical and pedagogical introduction to important topics for cutting edge research. We have seen the incredible appetite for these types of papers in the community with tutorials and user guides that have been published in recent years, (1−4) and this has encouraged us to officially highlight this type of publication with a new amendment to our information for authors across the nine ACS Au journals.In the short term, we offer a new type of publication, the \"Tutorial\", that we hope will help fill this gap in the literature. In the long term, we imagine collections of these tutorials that might provide a new way to effectively update textbooks, one chapter at a time.While the form and focus of an effective tutorial can vary significantly, we can suggest some guiding principles for authors embarking on this endeavor.Choosing a TopicClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The scope of a tutorial can either be relatively broad, e.g., an emerging field, or quite narrow, e.g., focused on a particular technique. A guiding principle is that it is a pedagogical introduction for a new reader in the area, providing information that cannot be found in a textbook or a research paper. Conceptual, Theoretical or PracticalA tutorial can encompass any and all of the aspects that are useful to bring a new reader into the field. In some instances, these can be important concepts that are difficult to draw out of the literature; in others, a theoretical description; and in many cases, a focus on practical execution, the how-to aspects of learning a new area. Feel free to use both the main text and the Supporting Information to educate the reader in how-to best practice. FAIR Data and CodeIn all cases, we strongly recommend making code and data available in association with the tutorial so that readers can immediately test play with the concept they are learning.We hope that both our readers and authors will enthusiastically embrace this change. It gives authors the opportunity to write the paper they wish they had been given when they entered the field and the paper they can and will hand out to prospective group members and use in their teaching to provide a gentler introduction to the world of their research. For our readers, we hope these papers will bridge the gap between the knowledge you already have and the research you want to do. Part of the privilege of being an open access journal is that we know these papers can reach readers, regardless of their circumstances, and we hope that we can provide a resource to inspire researchers wherever they are.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorGemma C.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical investigation involving electron collisions with cyanoacetylene is reported. Differential cross sections (DCSs), integral cross sections (ICSs), and momentum-transfer cross sections (MTCSs) for the elastic electron scattering were calculated using the Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method at the static-exchange plus polarization (SEP) level of approximation for energies ranging from 0.5 to 30 eV. The Schwinger variational method combined with Padé's approximants (SVPA), considering static-exchange-polarization plus absorption (SEPA), was also applied for impact energies from 0.1 to 1000 eV. These results were complemented by calculations performed according to the screen-corrected independent atom model (SCIAM). Furthermore, original measurements of absolute elastic (DCSs) at 20 eV were conducted in a crossed-beam apparatus. The theoretical results display an outstanding agreement with each other and an overall agreement with the calculated cross sections available in the literature. The agreement between the calculated and measured results is quite encouraging, further validating the thoroughness of the current research.",

ACS PublicationsPublished 2025 by American Chemical SocietySubjectswhat are subjectsArticle subjects are automatically applied from the ACS Subject Taxonomy and describe the scientific concepts and themes of the article.Chemistry educationGoldMaterialsPolymersUndergraduatesFor the last five years, ACS Publications has offered authors the ability to publish in two families of journals, our long-established family of journals that is available to readers through subscription as well as a newer family of open access (OA) journals where all published work is freely available to readers across the world. As part of the latter family of journals, the ACS Au open access journals were launched in 2021, greatly expanding ACS Publications' first forays into open access publishing that started with the launch of ACS Central Science (2015) and ACS Omega (2016). The ACS Au family of journals includes a large, selective multidisciplinary chemistry journal, JACS Au, serving as a companion to the flagship Journal of the American Chemical Society, and nine fully open access community focused journals covering the breadth of the chemical, biochemical, materials, environmental, and engineering disciplines.The launch of the ACS Au journal family further emphasizes ACS' commitment to supporting authors who choose, or are required by their funder, to publish in fully open access journals. As open access mandates continue to evolve around the world, we have continuously sought to provide authors with the options they need to publish their work in journals that feature high scientific rigor, thorough peer review, global impact and reach, and timely editorial decisions. Five years later, the journals are well-established and will continue to serve their communities as respected venues for high-quality research in chemistry and the allied fields.Recognizing that different authors have different accessibility to funding for Article Publication Charges (APCs), ACS also continues to support authors through the ACS special country pricing policy and ACS Read and Publish Agreements. Read and Publish agreements help institutions sustainably support the transition to open access, by growing the amount of work published open access, while also providing full access to ACS subscription content. Over the past five years, the number of ACS Read and Publish Agreements has expanded substantially, from covering 125 institutes in seven countries in 2019 to over 1,600 institutes across 46 countries in 2024 (Figure 1). 2024 also saw the establishment of first-of-their-kind \"Read and Green\" agreements to further expand the open access options ACS Publications provides for authors. We are delighted that ACS remains committed to expanding these agreements, enabling more authors to publish their work open access and for it to be available to anyone, anywhere in the world.Figure 1Figure 1. Growth of ACS Read and Publish Agreements since 2019.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWith such widespread and continually expanding coverage by Read and Publish agreements, authors based at many institutions around the world are choosing to publish open access even when their institutions or funding agencies do not require it. This is because open access papers and journals offer wider accessibility of published work, and authors naturally seek the broadest possible audience for their research products. Evidence for the increased usage can be seen in Figure 2, where the usage of hybrid ACS publications journals is dominated by researchers in East Asia and the Pacific (53%), the Western Hemisphere (21%), and Europe (19%), whereas usage of the Au family of journals includes a much stronger presence of readers in South Asia (15% vs 6% hybrid), the Middle East and North Africa (4.5% vs 1.2% hybrid), and Africa (1.5% vs 0.4% hybrid). All ten ACS Au journals received their inaugural full Journal Impact Factors (JIF) in the 2024 Journal Citation Reports, and with usage and citations continuing to grow year-on-year, it is anticipated that the momentum will continue as more researchers embrace open access publishing.Figure 2Figure 2. Global usage comparison of papers published in the ACS hybrid journal portfolio vs ACS gold open access journal portfolio 2021–2024.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe fully open access ACS Au journals have evolved to be highly author-centric. For instance, as a new journal, JACS Au is more than 10-fold smaller than the well-established Journal of the American Chemical Society, which allows our editorial team to invest substantial time understanding the nuance of each submission. In parallel, the Au community journals focus strongly on serving the needs of their respective scientific communities. As scientific communities are diverse, there have been numerous strategies employed to meet the needs of authors across the ten Au journals. For example, several editorials have been published across the portfolio that support authors by providing writing tips (DOI: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.2c00030), educating the community about giving proper CRediT (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.2c00029), and providing strategies for improving the visibility of publications (DOI: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00029). We have also leaned into the artistic creativity of our authors through editorials helping them with strategies for making cover art, and we have actively participated in the ACS Publications DEIR cover art series (DOIs: 10.1021/acsbiomedchemau.2c00028; 10.1021/acsorginorgau.2c00060; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00060; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00707; 10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00042; 10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00034; 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.4c00009). As the Au journals started during the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned quickly that a feeling of community is important for chemists and that our communities were looking for more than just advice on publishing. To this end, we have also provided editorials focused on mental health (10.1021/acspolymersau.2c00062) and strategies for fostering healthy, inclusive research ecosystems (10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00069; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00056).Another author- and reader-centric activity has been our focus on chemical education. Chemical education is critically important to the future of all chemists and our chemistry discipline, but traditionally, this topic has been primarily represented within the ACS Publications portfolio in the Journal of Chemical Education. The Au family of journals has the benefit that all content is available to anyone, anywhere in the world. Embracing this global reach, we have sought to publish interesting and innovative work on the pedagogy and scholarship of chemical education as well as new training materials of interest and value to researchers and educators across the globe who may not have access to ACS content through subscription. We have sought to ensure that the chemical education research community has a welcoming place to publish their latest research (DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00227; 10.1021/jacsau.3c00192), and we have supported the field through editorials and resources for educators. We have highlighted new teaching materials and cooperatives that help educators get the support and materials they need (DOIs: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.1c00020; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00014), and we have published open access tutorials and methods/protocols that can be used directly as alternatives or supplements to costly textbooks in undergraduate and graduate courses (DOIs: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00070; 10.1021/jacsau.4c00979). Finally, ACS has made a commitment to chemical educators at primarily undergraduate educational institutions with an ACS-sponsored Read and Publish agreement that waives the APC so that chemists can publish undergraduate research at over 170 institutions across the United States.Growing visibility and building relationships with the scientific communities we serve have been crucial for the ACS Au portfolio in these formative years. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to grow the number and diversity of publications in the journals and to celebrate this great content. It was also important to us that researchers at all career stages felt like they were represented. We have established an Early Career Advisory Board at JACS Au and the \"Rising Stars\" Special Issue series in the ACS Au community journals. Initiatives highlighting the researchers shaping the future of their fields will continue to be a feature of the Au journals into our future.As we close out this editorial, we would be remiss not to thank the numerous individuals and groups that have contributed to the growth and success of the Au family of journals. This includes our retired Editors and recently appointed Editors (Tables 1 and 2), as well as our dozens of dedicated Editorial Advisory Board members across the family of Au journals. We thank the authors who boldly submitted papers to our journals in the early days when global understanding of OA publishing was still limited, as well as our repeat authors who now, after five years, have published with us numerous times, in some cases more than a half dozen papers across the last four years. Finally, we have to thank all our referees. Peer review is the backbone of rigorous scientific publishing, and manuscripts published by ACS Publications are the most trusted, most cited, and most read because of the quality of our peer reviews and peer reviewers. Thank you to all the reviewers who have helped make the Au family of journals thrive.Table 1.

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the structural changes of lithium borate (LiB) glass 25Li2O-(75 - x)B2O3 was conducted in the absence and presence of lead(II) oxide or aluminum oxide (x = 10 mol %) glass modifiers. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were used to explore the structural properties of LiB glass by incorporating trace amounts of manganese(III) oxide (0.00-0.25 mol %) as a probe. Differential thermal analysis and XRD results for the glasses and their ceramics confirmed the integration of aluminum atoms into the glass framework by forming a lithium aluminum boron oxide Li2(AlB5O10) crystalline phase. Lead atoms were located interstitially, which disordered the borate glass structure and produced a lithium tetraborate crystalline phase. Semiempirical modeling of the glass structures was conducted to estimate the fundamental vibrational modes of the glass materials using a parametric method 3 (PM3MM) with molecular mechanics corrections to elucidate the geometry of the borate (BO3) groups and their possible vibrational modes. Our analysis revised the conventional representation of the tetrahedral BO4 units, which were not observed, to \"distorted-trigonal\" BO3 groups and associated with nonbridging oxygen (NBO) atoms. EPR spectroscopy established a link between the NBO in oxides and the well-defined peak at g-factor ∼4.2 in glass materials, which had been assigned to iron(III) ions according to the literature.",

    "abstract": "The kinetics of oxygen exchange dictate the rate of redox reactions, which is crucial for electrochemical-based sustainable technologies. In this study, we use isotope exchange pulse responses to elucidate the oxygen exchange mechanism for (Bi0.8Tm0.2)2O3-δ (BTM)-(La0.8Sr0.2)0.99MnO3-δ (LSM) composites. With an optimized composition and microstructure, these composites can achieve polarization resistances below 0.01 Ω·cm2 at 700 °C. Analysis of the oxygen exchange rate, , by splitting it into elementary processes using the serial two-step scheme, demonstrates that both the dissociative adsorption and incorporation of oxygen are accelerated in BTM-LSM compared to the parent phases. Dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen is rate-limiting below 900 °C in the range 0.002-0.05 atm O2 and below 850 °C in 0.21 atm O2. Cation interdiffusion or changes in the electronic structure at the interface between the two materials create an electrocatalytically active region spanning 1-40 nm around the BTM-LSM phase boundary. Oxygen exchange coefficients within this region were estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of the entire composite surface. We propose two potential pathways for oxygen exchange in BTM-LSM, with calculated p O2 dependencies for each rate-determining step (rds). The p O2 dependency of reveals that molecular oxygen is involved in the rds.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the low-temperature behavior of concentrated aqueous solutions of cesium chloride and discover two hydrates of CsCl. We employ four different methods, namely, (i) simple cooling at rates between 0.5 and 80 K s–1, (ii) simple cooling followed by pressurization, (iii) hyperquenching at 106 to 107 K s–1, and (iv) hyperquenching followed by pressurization. Depending on the method, different types of phase behaviors are observed, which encompass crystallization involving freeze-concentration, pressure-induced amorphization, full vitrification, and polyamorphic transformation. The CsCl hydrates discovered in our work cold-crystallize above 150 K upon heating after ultrafast vitrification (routes iii and iv) and show melting temperatures below the eutectic temperature of 251 K. We determine the composition of these hydrates to be CsCl·5H2O and CsCl·6H2O and find evidence for their existence in ESEM, calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. The dominant and less metastable hydrate is the hexahydrate, where the pentahydrate appears as a minority species. We also reveal the birthplace for the CsCl hydrates, namely, the freeze-concentrated solution (FCS) formed upon cold-crystallization of the fully glassy solution (from iii and iv). The spongy FCS produced upon cooling of the liquid (from i and ii) is incapable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. By contrast, the FCS produced upon heating the glassy solution (from iii and iv) shows tiny, fine features that are capable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. Our findings contradict the current knowledge that alkali chlorides only have hydrates for the smaller cations Li+ and Na+, but not for the larger cations K+, Rb+, and Cs+ and pave the way for future determination of CsCl-hydrate crystal structures. The pathway to metastable crystalline materials outlined here might be more generally applicable and found in nature, e.g., in comets or on interstellar dust grains, when glassy aqueous solutions crystallize upon heating.",

Existing degradation techniques are frequently lacking due to their low efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and potential for secondary contamination. Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) technology has emerged as a promising alternative, utilizing energized reactive species to break down PFASs under ambient conditions. Therefore, this review examines the efficacy and effectiveness of CAP in degrading PFASs by reviewing various CAP setups and examining the key factors involved.

Our work introduces the use of heavy atoms as a strategy for suppressing phonon transport in organic molecules. Starting with a one-dimensional (1D) force-constant model and density functional theory calculations of model chemical systems, we illustrate how increasing the mass of a central atom affects phonon transmission and conductance. Following this, we turned our attention to the chemically accessible systems of metallapolyynes and extended metal atom chains (EMACs). Our findings suggest that several of the studied EMACs exhibit thermal conductance either near or below a recently proposed threshold of 10 pW/K─a crucial step toward reaching high thermoelectric figure of merits. Specifically, we predict that the molecule MoMoNi(npo)4(NCS)2 has a thermal conductance of just 8.3 pW/K at 300 K. Our results demonstrate that conceptually simple chemical modifications can markedly reduce the thermal conductance of single molecules; these results both deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving single-molecule phonon thermal conductance and suggest a path toward using single molecules as thermoelectric materials.",
