    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest owing to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.",

However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (k\n            cat = 13 s−1, >1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates.",

The cell-in-shells hold the potential to overcome the inherent limitations of biologically naı̈ve cells, enabling the acquisition of exogenous phenotypic traits through the chemical process known as single-cell nanoencapsulation (SCNE). This review highlights recent advancements in the development of artificial spores, with sections organized based on the categorization of material types utilized in SCNE, specifically organic, hybrid, and inorganic types. Particular emphasis is placed on the cytoprotective and multifunctional roles of nanoshells, demonstrating potential applications of SCNEd cells across diverse fields, including synthetic biology, biochemistry, materials science, and biomedical engineering. Furthermore, the perspectives outlined in this review propose future research directions in SCNE, with the goal of achieving fine-tuned precision in chemical modulation at both intracellular and pericellular levels, paving the way for the design and construction of customized artificial spores tailored to meet specific functional needs.",

Noncanonical amino acids are not encoded by the standard genetic code, but they carry unique side chain chemistries, e.g., to perform bioorthogonal conjugation reactions or to manipulate the physicochemical properties of a protein such as folding and stability. The method was introduced nearly 70 years ago and is still in widespread use because of its simplicity and robustness. In our study, we review the trends in the field during the last two decades. We give an overview of the application of the method for artificial post-translational protein modifications and the selective functionalization and directed immobilization of proteins. We highlight the trends in the use of noncanonical amino acids for the analysis of nascent proteomes and the engineering of enzymes and biomaterials, and the progress in the biosynthesis of amino acid analogs.

The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product. We also showcase how synergistic experimental and computational investigations have enabled the elucidation of specific noncovalent interactions responsible for selective stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductors form the foundational bedrock of modern electronics and numerous cutting-edge technologies. Particularly, semiconductors crafted from organic building blocks hold immense promise as next-generation pioneers, thanks to their vast array of chemical structures, customizable frontier orbital energy levels and bandgap structures, and easily adjustable π electronic properties. Over the past 50 years, advancements in chemistry and materials science have facilitated extensive investigations into small organic π compounds, oligomers, and polymers, resulting in a rich library of organic semiconductors. However, a longstanding challenge persists: how to organize π building units or chains into well-defined π structures, which are crucial for the performance of organic semiconductors. Consequently, the pursuit of methodologies capable of synthesizing and/or fabricating organic semiconductors with ordered structures has emerged as a frontier in organic and polymeric semiconductor research. In this context, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) stand out as unique platforms allowing for the covalent integration of organic π units into periodically ordered π structures, thus facilitating the development of semiconductors with extended yet precisely defined π architectures. Since their initial report in 2008, significant strides have been made in exploring various chemistries to develop semiconducting COFs, resulting in a rich library of structures, properties, functions, and applications. This review provides a comprehensive yet focused exploration of the general structural features of semiconducting COFs, outlining the basic principles of structural design, illustrating the linkage chemistry and synthetic strategies based on typical one-pot polymerization reactions to demonstrate the growth of bulk materials, nanosheets, films, and membranes. By elucidating the interactions between COFs and various entities such as photons, phonons, electrons, holes, ions, molecules, and spins, this review categorizes semiconducting COFs into nine distinct sections: semiconductors, photoconductors, light emitters, sensors, photocatalysts, photothermal conversion materials, electrocatalysts, energy storage electrodes, and radical spin materials, focusing on disclosing structure-originated properties and functions. Furthermore, this review scrutinizes structure-function correlations and highlights the unique features, breakthroughs, and challenges associated with semiconducting COFs. Furnished with foundational knowledges and state-of-the-art insights, this review predicts the fundamental issues to be addressed and outlines future directions for semiconducting COFs, offering a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving and remarkable field.",

This Review examines key studies to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy. Two DPL methods, in particular, show great promise: organic azide/diazirine cross-linkers (Z-cross-linkers) and UV-cross-linkable organic semiconducting blends (X-blends). These methods not only simplify the photolithography process significantly but also enhance the chemical and physical resistance of patterned organic semiconductors against photolithographic chemicals and tandem solution-depositions. Consequently, these advancements enable the fabrication of organic integrated circuits entirely through solution processes. In conclusion, photolithography of organic semiconductors serves a dual purpose: it facilitates the patterning of active layers for OFETs and acts as an enabling technology for fabricating sophisticated and cost-effective organic integrated circuits.",

    "abstract": "The study of interfacial properties in liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor systems has a history of nearly 200 years, with significant contributions from scientific luminaries such as Thomas Young and Willard Gibbs. However, a similar level of understanding of solid-liquid interfaces has emerged only more recently, largely because of the numerous complications associated with the thermodynamics needed to describe them. The accurate calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid-liquid systems is central to determining which interfaces will be observed and their properties. However, designing and analyzing the molecular dynamics simulations required to do this remains challenging, unlike the liquid-liquid or liquid-vapor cases, because of the unique complications associated with solid-liquid systems. Specifically, the lattice structure of solids introduces spatial directionality, and atomic configurations in solids can be altered by stretching. The primary aim of this review is to provide an overview of the numerical approaches developed to address the challenge of calculating the interfacial free energy in solid-liquid systems. These approaches are classified as (i) direct methods, which compute interfacial free energies explicitly, albeit often through convoluted procedures, and (ii) indirect methods, which derive these free energies as secondary results obtained from the analysis of simulations of an idealized experimental configuration. We also discuss two key topics related to the calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid-liquid systems: nucleation theory and curved interfaces, which represent important problems where research remains highly active.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence emitters with a multiple-resonant (MR) effect have become a research hotspot. These MR emitters mainly consist of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with boron/nitrogen, nitrogen/carbonyl, and indolocarbazole frameworks. The staggered arrangement of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital facilitates MR, resulting in smaller internal reorganization energy and a narrower emission bandwidth. Optimal charge separation suppresses the energy gap between singlet and triplet excited states, favoring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). These MR-TADF materials, due to color purity and high emission efficiency, are excellent candidates for organic light-emitting diodes. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain; in particular, the limitation imposed by the alternated core configuration hinders their diversity and versatility. Most existing MR-TADF materials are concentrated in the blue-green range, with only a few in red and near-infrared spectra. This review provides a timely and comprehensive screening of MR emitters from their pioneering work to the present. Our goal is to gain understandings of the MR-TADF structure-performance relationship from both basic and advanced perspectives. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the correlations between chemical structure, photophysical properties and electroluminescent performance in both depth and breadth with an aim to promote the future development of MR emitters.",

This review provides a detailed classification of the various \"windows\" of SEs and a comprehensive understanding of the associated interfacial stability of SEs in full battery application. The paper begins with a historical overview of SE development, followed by a detailed discussion of their structural characteristics. Next, examination of various methodologies used to calculate and measure the ECW is presented, culminating in the proposal of standardized testing procedures. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the numerous parameters that influence the thermodynamic ECW of SEs is provided, along with a synthesis of strategies to address these challenges. At last, this review concludes with an in-depth exploration of the interfacial issues associated with SEs exhibiting narrow ECWs in full SSLBs.",

We open by briefly discussing fundamental photoelectrochemical concepts and implications for photoelectrode function. We next review a broad range of semiconductor photoelectrodes broken down by material class (oxides, nitrides, chalcogenides, and mature photovoltaic semiconductors), identifying intrinsic properties and discussing their influence on performance. We then identify innovative in situ and operando techniques to directly probe the photoelectrode|electrolyte interface, enabling direct assessment of structure-property relationships for catalytic surfaces in active reaction environments. We close by considering more complex photoelectrochemical fuel-forming reactions (carbon dioxide and nitrogen reduction, as well as alternative oxidation reactions), where product selectivity imposes additional criteria on electrochemical driving force and photoelectrode architecture. By contextualizing recent literature within a fundamental framework, we seek to provide direction for continued progress toward achieving efficient and stable fuel-forming photoelectrodes.",

The use of small molecule ligands that bind to amyloid fibrils underpins both fundamental research aiming to better understand the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, and clinical research aiming to develop diagnostic tools for these diseases. To date, a large number of amyloid-binding ligands have been reported in the literature, predominantly targeting protein fibrils composed of amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and α-synuclein (αSyn) fibrils. Fibrils formed by a particular protein can adopt a range of possible morphologies, but protein fibrils formed in vivo possess disease-specific morphologies, highlighting the need for morphology-specific amyloid-binding ligands. This review details the morphologies of Aβ, tau, and αSyn fibril polymorphs that have been reported as a result of structural work and describes a database of amyloid-binding ligands containing 4,288 binding measurements for 2,404 unique compounds targeting Aβ, tau, or αSyn fibrils.",

We evaluate each method's complexities, the resources they require, and their effectiveness in addressing coherent, incoherent, and state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Furthermore, we introduce Deterministic Benchmarking (DB), a novel protocol that minimizes the number of experimental runs, exhibits resilience to SPAM errors, and effectively characterizes both coherent and incoherent errors. The implementation of DB is experimentally validated using a superconducting transmon qubit, and the results are substantiated with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations.

    "abstract": "The exciton Bohr radius is a defining feature in conventional quantum dot physics. Three distinct confinement regimes are usually recognized: the weak, intermediate, and strong confinement regimes. Which of these is relevant depends on the relative size of the quantum dot in terms of the exciton Bohr radius. However, this classification is primarily based on the linear optical properties of the nanocrystal. During the transition from the molecule to the bulk crystal, structural, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties change as well. In this review, we discuss the cluster regime, where the exciton experiences extreme confinement. In the cluster regime, not only do linear optical properties deviate significantly from the effective mass approximation, but other material properties also begin to deviate from their bulk values. These deviations are only observable in the size regime, where the intrinsic length scales are much smaller than the exciton Bohr radius. Crucially, computational methods allow chemists to explore this region far more quantitatively than in the past.",

    "abstract": "In the information age, novel hardware solutions are urgently needed to efficiently store and process increasing amounts of data. In this scenario, memory devices must evolve significantly to provide the necessary bit capacity, performance, and energy efficiency needed in computation. In particular, novel computing paradigms have emerged to minimize data movement, which is known to contribute the largest amount of energy consumption in conventional computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture. In-memory computing (IMC) provides a means to compute within data with minimum data movement and excellent energy efficiency and performance. To meet these goals, resistive-switching random-access memory (RRAM) appears to be an ideal candidate thanks to its excellent scalability and nonvolatile storage. However, circuit implementations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models require highly specialized device properties that need careful RRAM device engineering. This work addresses the RRAM concept from materials, device, circuit, and application viewpoints, focusing on the physical device properties and the requirements for storage and computing applications. Memory applications, such as embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) in novel microcontroller units (MCUs) and storage class memory (SCM), are highlighted. Applications in IMC, such as hardware accelerators of neural networks, data query, and algebra functions, are illustrated by referring to the reported demonstrators with RRAM technology, evidencing the remaining challenges for the development of a low-power, sustainable AI.",

Nonetheless, the success of this reaction requires full control over diastereoselectivity, eradication of a parasitic process of over-reduction or migration of the C-C double bond formed, and achieving satisfactory functional-group compatibility. The review demonstrates developments in the field of alkyne semihydrogenation over the period 2010-2022, with selected papers published in 2023 and 2024, emphasizing solutions to the above-mentioned limitations. We discuss mechanistic aspects of this transformation, including those related to unconventional systems. The review includes examples of applications of alkyne semihydrogenation in organic synthesis, confirming the considerable utility of this process.

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe exploitation of combustion of materials stands as a cornerstone of early human development. A theoretical framework for this field began to take shape only around 1700 and finally achieved a sound foundation through the electronic quantum-chemical oxidation concepts of the 20th century. Eventually, a decade ago the IUPAC defined the essential rules for a unique definition of atomic oxidation states (OS) or OS numbers in molecules and extended structures. In specific cases, however, these rules need be tailored to specific chemical observations, including amazing experiences with the heaviest elements. We review our findings and updated interpretations, particularly with regard to previously unexpected trends in the highest oxidation states (HOS) of heavy atomic compounds.The HOS is a qualitative integer parameter for characterizing the chemistry of an element. It is determined by three basic factors: (i) by the number g of loosely bound electrons in the atom's valence shell, usually related to its group number G in the periodic table (g = G mod 10, with mod meaning g = 2 to 8 for G = 12-18); (ii) by the fraction of these g electrons that can be chemically activated and may fall below g toward the end of a series; and (iii) by the local and long-range \"environmental\" conditions (mainly the interaction strengths of the ligands), which range from those in normal life, laboratories and industry, to more extreme conditions such as deep inside the Earth, outside in cosmic space, or in special laboratories.In recent years, our group has systematically investigated the regularity of the HOS over the periodic table, in particular the electronic structures of compounds of various d- (transition metals) and f-block elements (lanthanides and actinides), applying both density-functional approximations and more advanced quantum-chemical methods. Details of the HOS values in the border ranges of feasibility, depending on thermodynamic environment and ligand-interaction capabilities, are conceptually analyzed, incorporating also discoveries of other researchers. The patterns of the HOS from the light s- and sp- to the heavy d- and f-block elements are elucidated, showing systematic deviations from simple textbook rules. The particularly large and small Core-Valence (CV) orbital-energy gaps at, respectively, the upper-right and lower-left corners of the periodic table interrupt the regular trends of the HOS of the sp-block elements, causing HOS < g (as for O or Pt) or HOS > g (as for Cs or Ra). On the other hand, the d-transition metals (TM) and also the actinide 5f-series (An) in the middle of the periodic table show a more uniform variation of the HOS with one common maximum at 8(±1), while the lanthanide 4f-series (Ln) shows two lower HOS maxima, due to their peculiarly small 4f-orbital radii and varying energies.Our report is intended both as a summary of knowledge, as a distillation of new insights, and as a roadmap for further research into the oxidation phenomena.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusRadical migration represents a powerful strategy for reaction discovery and development in organic synthesis, offering access to unprecedented functional molecules and chemical space. In this Account, we describe our contributions to the field, particularly focusing on 1,2-radical acyloxy migration (RAM), a process involving the transposition of a radical and an acyloxy group. We highlight its application in carbohydrate modification and allyl carboxylate trifunctionalization, demonstrating how this reactivity enables the streamlined synthesis of novel glycomimetics and facilitates selective 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. These advances establish 1,2-RAM as a versatile platform for catalytic radical transformations, unlocking new opportunities in reaction development and functional molecule design.Our approach leverages excited-state palladium and ground-state nickel catalysis to modify carbohydrates, specifically at the C2 position. This strategy enables C2-deoxy-hydrogenation, deuteration, iodination, alkenylation, allylation, ketonylation, and arylation reactions, providing direct access to unprecedented glycomimetics. These transformations streamline the synthesis of structurally diverse glycomimetics, facilitating the discovery and development of carbohydrate-based functional molecules. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance of these catalytic systems make them particularly attractive for late-stage functionalization, broadening their applicability in complex molecule synthesis.Beyond carbohydrates, we have extended 1,2-RAM reactivity to achieve unprecedented 1,2,3-trifunctionalization of allyl carboxylates. By employing excited-state phosphine catalysis, we demonstrate a 1,3-carbobromination reaction accompanied by an acyloxy shift. This proof-of-concept study lays the foundation for developing a broader range of 1,2,3-trifunctionalization reactions, effectively transforming allyl carboxylates into substituted isopropyl carboxylate donors. This advancement expands the synthetic utility of allyl carboxylates, enabling the rapid construction of structurally diverse molecular scaffolds.In summary, the 1,2-RAM reactivity opens a new avenue for reaction discovery and development, granting access to new functional molecules and chemical space. The mild conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and unique reactivity of this approach make it a valuable tool for chemical synthesis. We anticipate that merging 1,2-RAM with other catalytic platforms will further advance bond disconnection strategies, provide access to new functional molecules, and expand the frontiers of chemical synthesis.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe bacterial cell wall is a complex structure that is primarily composed of peptidoglycan (PG), which provides protection from the environment and structural rigidity for the cell. As such, PG plays an important role in bacterial survival, which has made its biosynthesis a crucial target for antibiotic development for many decades. Despite long-standing efforts to inhibit PG construction, much remains unknown about the enzymes required for PG biosynthesis or how PG composition and architecture are altered to enable adaptation to environmental stressors. This knowledge will be crucial in the identification of new ways to interfere with PG construction that could overcome widespread resistance to cell wall-targeting antibacterial agents.All bacterial species possess a suite of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are critical actors in PG construction and remodeling, as well as the main targets of β-lactam antibiotics. While the importance of the PBPs is well-known, the field lacks a complete understanding of PBP activity regulation, localization, and critical protein-protein interactions during the growth and division process. Bacteria possess between 4 and 16 PBP homologues with only one or several being genetically essential in each cell. A key outstanding question about these proteins is why bacteria expend the energy required to maintain this relatively large number of related proteins when so few are required to maintain life. The Carlson lab focuses on the development of chemical tools to address this fundamental question. In particular, we have generated a suite of chemical probes to selectively target one or a small number of PBP homologues in their catalytically active state. These activity-based probes (ABPs) have and will continue to enable a deeper understanding of the traits that differentiate the PBPs over the bacterial lifespan.In this account, we discuss the development of selective chemical tools to study the PBPs. Key to our success has been assessment of the PBP inhibition profiles of an expansive set of commercially available β-lactams in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This work has directly identified molecules that can be used in chemical genetic studies and provided scaffolds for the generation of PBP-selective ABPs. We also discovered a novel β-lactone scaffold that is exquisitely selective for PBPs over other protein classes and targets a different subclass of these proteins than related β-lactams. Using these probes, we have explored PG biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis yielding new insights about their cell wall construction and remodeling processes, as well as specialized activities under stress.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusCarbon-based materials─often with superlative electronic, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties─are often categorized by dimensionality and hybridization. Most of these categories are produced in high-temperature conditions that afford equilibrium-dictated structures, but limit their diversity. In contrast, an emerging class of one-dimensional (1D) carbon materials, coined nanothreads, are accessible through kinetically controlled solid-state reactions of small multiply unsaturated molecules. While abundant in molecular organic synthesis, exerting kinetic control over reactivity is a revolutionary approach to access dense carbon networks. Owing to their internal diamond-like core, these materials are calculated to span a wide range of mechanical and optical properties, with the introduction of functional groups and/or heteroatoms leading to tailorable band gaps and the potential to access electronic states that are not featured in traditional polymers or nanomaterials. Accessing these properties requires the ability to precisely control solid-state molecular reaction pathways, chemical connectivity, and heteroatom/functional group density. Carbon nanothreads are often synthesized through the pressure-induced polymerization of aromatic molecules (e.g., benzene, pyridine, and thiophene) upon compression to 23-40 GPa. While the high pressures required to achieve these crystalline materials often preclude making synthetically viable quantities of product, the use of lessened aromatic reactants, along with light and/or heat, enables more mild reaction pressures. Success to date in forming nanothreads from diverse reactants suggests that physical organic principles govern the reaction, along with topochemical relationships, enabling the emergence of a new field of carbon chemistry that combines the control of organic chemistry with the range of physical properties only possible in extended periodic solids.In this Account, we describe our efforts to rationally synthesize carbon nanothreads with desired structures and present our approaches to dictate reactivity in the organic solid state that enable the formation of crystalline 1D carbon materials. In particular, we focus on the principles being pursued by our group to expand the chemical diversity of materials being accessed, while highlighting efforts that both enhance selectivity over reaction pathways and reduce pressure requirements for polymerization. We begin by leveraging starting materials with lessened or no aromaticity (relative to benzene) to design new backbones while enabling lower pressures such as 15-20 GPa to achieve nanothread formation. Next, we discuss efforts to utilize photochemical activation as a means to dictate the reaction pathway and/or affect the mechanism while also achieving ordered crystalline solids at reduced pressures. Lastly, we highlight efforts to demonstrate kinetic control in solid-state reactions by leveraging supramolecular chemistry (e.g., aryl/perfluoroaryl interactions, hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking) to preorganize starting materials into polymerizable molecular stacks. The resultant design principles provide multiple opportunities to attain previously inaccessible sp3-rich 1D polymeric carbon nanomaterials with unique structures and properties from widely available small molecules. Moreover, the kinetic control provided in the organic solid state enables a priori functionalization and the design of a rich diversity of materials with emergent properties in stark contrast to many well-developed carbon materials.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn this Accounts article, we summarize our recent work on truncating conjugated two-dimensional framework materials down to a single pore, or a single macrocycle. Conjugated 2D architectures have emerged as one of the most synthetically adaptable motifs for coupling semiconductivity and porosity in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, despite their prevalence, 2D architectures have several limitations. In particular, the strong interlayer π-π stacking can limit both processability and the accessibility of internal active sites. We have found that simple macrocycles preserve key aspects of 2D framework structure and function, including porosity and out-of-plane electrical conductivity, while providing improved processability, surface tunability, and mass transport properties. In this article, we first describe our synthetic approach and general design considerations. Specifically, we show how ditopic analogues of the tritopic ligands commonly found in the synthesis of 2D MOFs and COFs can be used to achieve a diverse library of conjugated macrocycles that resemble fragments of semiconducting frameworks in both form and function. The length of the peripheral side chains, the size of the aromatic core, and the solubility of intermediates are all key variables in favoring selective macrocycle formation over undesired linear polymers and oligomers. Next, we highlight the unique advantages that macrocycles provide, including improved processability, atomically precise surface tunability, and greater active site accessibility. In particular, the identity of the peripheral side chains dramatically impacts both solubility and colloidal stability as well as crystal size and morphology. We further show how the solution processability and nanoscale dimensions of macrocycles can simplify electronic device fabrication and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, we end with a forward-looking discussion on how macrocycles offer a unique bridge between conjugated molecules and extended frameworks, enabling new application areas and fundamental science.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe ongoing accumulation of plastic waste in landfills and in the environment is driving research on chemical processes and catalysts to recycle polymers. Traditional modeling strategies are not applicable to these processes because they involve too many reactants and intermediates, one for each molecular weight and each functionalization. To model the kinetics, we have developed population balance models (PBMs) that account for macromolecular reactants in the bulk and macromolecular catalytic intermediates. These PBMs couple to each other through polymer adsorption and desorption models and to traditional rate equations for small molecule products and co-reactants (like hydrogen or ethylene). The models, in combination with experimental data, are being used in many ways: (i) to test mechanistic hypotheses, (ii) to extract rate parameters, (iii) to quantitatively compare catalyst activities, (iv) to account for mass transfer and vapor-liquid partitioning in two-phase reactors, and (v) to design novel support architectures and catalysts that mimic the processive action of natural depolymerization enzymes. Some key theoretical advances allow PBMs to be constructed from elementary rates and mechanisms, as opposed to traditional formulations with pseudoelementary rate parameters invoked as fitting parameters. We discuss ways to build these models \"bottom-up\" from first-principles calculations and ways to extract model parameters from \"top down\" analyses of rate data. The combination provides a quantitative bridge between first-principles calculations and the kinetics of complex macromolecular transformations for polymer upcycling and beyond.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusAdsorptive and membrane separations are recognized as highly energy-efficient technologies, critically dependent on the properties of adsorbent and membrane materials. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs), such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal-organic cages (MOCs), and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), have emerged as exceptional candidates for high-performance adsorbents and membranes due to their intrinsic structural tunability. Their orderly pore structure, high porosity, and large surface facilitate gas storage and separation processes. Furthermore, modifying the inner surface, controlling the pore size, and regulating the framework flexibility can significantly enhance CPMs' adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Therefore, the precise structure regulation of CPMs is the key to optimizing gas separation and purification.Reticular chemistry is the use of strong chemical bonds to connect discrete molecular structures (molecules or molecular clusters) to create extended structures, such as CPMs. It allows precise atomic-level control and offers a method for regulating the structures of CPMs, enabling tailored pore environments that enhance selectivity for target separations. This approach is crucial to designing effective gas separation materials. For example, by functionalizing organic ligands, regulating metal ions, and modifying secondary building units, the pore size, porosity, and functionality of CPMs can be finely controlled while keeping the framework topology unchanged, thereby optimizing the gas separation performance.In this Account, we present an overview of our group's research efforts on optimizing gas separation by fine-tuning CPM adsorbents and membranes. Using reticular chemistry, we have developed strategies such as multiple cooperative regulation, adaptive pore control, pore environment engineering, preprocessed monomer interfacial polymerization, and precursor solution processing to create highly selective CPM adsorbents and membranes. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of multiple hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions between CPMs and hydrocarbon molecules. By precise structural regulation, we further optimize the gas separation performance and broaden CPMs' applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for CPM adsorbents and membranes, including material design, synthesis, stability, performance, and the structure-activity relationship. We also propose a membrane-adsorptive separation coupling technology as a potential solution for achieving high-purity gas separation. By utilizing CPM-based adsorbents and membranes, we aim to establish an energy-intensive and environmentally friendly pathway for the separation of low-carbon hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and natural gas, providing a sustainable alternative to conventional high-energy gas separation processes.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSingle-atom skeletal editing strategies that precisely modify the core frameworks of molecules have the potential to streamline and accelerate organic synthesis by enabling conceptually simple, but otherwise synthetically challenging, retrosynthetic disconnections. In contrast to broader skeletal remodeling and rearrangement strategies, these methodologies more specifically target single-atom changes with high selectivity, even within complex molecules such as natural products or pharmaceuticals. For the past several years, our laboratory has developed several skeletal editing methodologies, including single-atom ring contractions, expansions, and transpositions of both saturated and unsaturated heterocycles, as well as other carbon scaffolds. This Account details the evolution of \"skeletal editing logic\" within the context of our extensive work on natural product total synthesis.Early work in the Sarpong group leveraged metal-mediated C-C bond cleavage of in situ-generated strained intermediates to accomplish total syntheses of natural products, such as the icetexane diterpenoids and cyathane diterpenes. Continuing our focus on leveraging C-C bond cleavage through \"break-it-to-make-it\" strategies, we then developed carvone remodeling strategies to access a variety of terpenoids (including longiborneol sesquiterpenoids, phomactins, and xishacorenes) from hydroxylated pinene derivatives. In applying this skeletal remodeling and C-C cleavage framework to alkaloid natural products, such as the preparaherquimides and lycodine-type alkaloids, we recognized that single-atom changes to the saturated nitrogen-containing rings within these natural products would enable the direct conversion between distinct but structurally related natural product families. Thus, we began developing methods that selectively modify the core frameworks of N-heterocycles; this focus led to our work on the deconstructive fluorination and diversification of piperidines and ultimately to our recent body of work on direct, single-atom core framework modifications (single-atom skeletal editing). In the context of saturated heterocycles, we developed photomediated enantioselective ring contractions of α-acylated motifs and reductive ring contractions of cyclic hydroxylamines. For unsaturated heterocycles, we have developed ring contractions of azines (e.g., pyrimidine to pyrazole), 15N isotopic labeling of azines, and phototranspositions of indazoles to benzimidazoles. To direct our focus on reaction development, a cheminformatic analysis of heteroaromatic skeletal edits served to quantitatively inform which transformations would most significantly expand the accessible chemical space. Apart from heterocycles, we also reported single-nitrogen insertion through the reductive amination of carbonyl C-C bonds. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop mild and selective skeletal editing methodologies that can be applied to total synthesis and organic synthesis more generally. While recent total syntheses from our group have targeted simplified retrosyntheses through single-atom skeletal editing logic (e.g., daphenylline and harringtonolide), multiple steps were still required to achieve the formal desired \"edit\". As such, the continued development of truly single-step, mild, and selective reactions that can edit the cores of highly complex molecules remains highly desirable.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe world's plastics production continues to grow and could triple by 2060. Unfortunately, only a small proportion of these plastics are currently recycled (around 30%). The remainder is incinerated (around 40%), causing high greenhouse gas emissions, or buried (around 30%), resulting in high levels of microplastic pollution. Ambitious national and international policies have been put in place to increase the proportion of recycled plastics, and major research efforts are underway to improve plastic recycling processes. Unfortunately, all recycling processes (chemical, physical, and biological) require batches of plastics to be recycled that are as homogeneous as possible. Rigorous waste sorting is therefore essential, and marking plastics with luminescent markers could provide a solution. It could also enable circular and short-loop recycling in which an object is recycled into an identical object.Heterolanthanide coordination polymers are particularly promising candidates for this application. They have demonstrated their effectiveness in the field of anticounterfeiting marking. However, their use in materials traceability requires other assets, such as markers with luminescence properties that are sufficiently different and sufficiently intense for them to be easily identified on a rapid sorting line, as laboratory analysis is no longer relevant for this application.To prepare such a range of compounds, it is necessary to master the mechanisms that govern luminescence properties. The choice of ligand and metal centers, crystal structure, and particle shaping all have a major influence on luminescence properties. Our group has been working on understanding these phenomena for some 20 years.Using as an example the family of heterolanthanide coordination polymers with general chemical formula [Ln2(bdc)3(H2O)4]∞, where bdc2- represents benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate, we wish to present here the various levers that can be used to modulate the emission colors and increase the luminescence intensity of heterolanthanide coordination polymers and describe a family of markers that can be used in the field of materials traceability. Beyond the choice of the metallic centers and of the ligands, markers can be designed in the form of core-shell particles, with an intermediate optically nonactive insulating shell that separates the core from the shell that are both made of optically active molecular alloys. Intermetallic energy transfers are therefore minimized, resulting in increased luminescence intensity and emission color modulation. In conclusion, we would like to draw up a rough sketch of what could be the markers used in the field of plastics traceability.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusSingle atom catalysis has garnered widespread attention in the past decade. In general, single atom catalysis refers to a catalytic process involving the participation of single atom sites. A single atom site refers to an active site with only one metal atom playing the main role in the catalysis process. This metal atom is usually coordinated by other atoms in the active site and anchored on the support. Heterogeneous catalysts in which all active sites are single atom sites are referred to as single atom site catalysts (SASCs). Owing to their distinctive active site architecture, single atom catalysis has shown ultrahigh atomic utilization efficiency and unique catalytic activity and selectivity in many systems such as thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.However, the preparation of SASCs poses significant challenges as metal species tend to sinter and agglomerate during high-temperature treatment. In the past decade, we have challenged the controllable preparation of SASCs based on more than ten years of experience in nanomaterial synthesis. Several representative SASC preparation strategies have been proposed by our group, such as pyrolysis of MOFs with metal ions doped in the skeleton, M@ZIF-8 with a metal precursor fixed by the host-guest interaction, and M/N-rich support precursors. Additionally, \"top-down\" strategies starting from metal nanoparticles have been established. Based on these synthetic strategies, a systematic SASCs toolbox has been successfully built.In addition to the SASCs, we have expanded the toolbox to include the dual-atom-site catalysts (DASCs) (including active sites with dual active metal atoms or including dual kinds of single atom sites) and nanosingle-atom-site catalysts (NSASCs) (catalysts with both single atom sites and nanoparticle/cluster sites). With the help of a variety of \"tools\" in the toolbox, single atom catalysis has shown its application value in many important processes such as bulk chemical catalysis, fine chemical catalysis, energy catalysis, and environmental catalysis. Based on laboratory-scale research, we further explored the feasibility of single atom catalysis in industrial catalysis and successfully applied single atom catalysis to industrial-level automobile exhaust purification, which will soon achieve commercialization.This Account provides a concise overview of the evolution of single atom catalysis, summarizes the preparation strategies for SASCs pioneered by our group over the past decade, and highlights the SASCs toolbox developed through these strategies. We also showcase the practical applications of the SASCs toolbox in key catalytic fields, highlight our progress in advancing the industrialization of single atom catalysis (particularly for automobile exhaust purification), and discuss the future prospects of single atom catalysis in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusOxidative decarboxylative coupling (ODC) reactions have been recognized as powerful alternatives to traditional cross-coupling reactions due to the ability to generate (hetero)biaryl structures from simple and readily available carboxylic acid precursors. These reactions, however, are underdeveloped due to the requirement for ortho-nitrobenzoate coupling partners and silver salts as oxidants. Our research program has focused on the development of new catalytic ODC reactions, as well as mechanistic studies of these reactions to uncover the origin of these synthetic limitations. As the framework for these studies, we explored two key ODC reactions developed in our group: (1) a Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation reaction that relies on silver as the oxidant and (2) a Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction capable of operating under aerobic conditions. Our findings, disclosed in this Account, have uncovered the importance of the ortho-substituent and revealed that Ag-based oxidants are also responsible for mediating the decarboxylation and transmetalation steps.Systematic exploration of the decarboxylation of a series of well-defined Ag-benzoate complexes allowed us to probe the importance of the ortho-nitro group in the decarboxylation step. Kinetic measurements of a large series of differently substituted benzoates were found to correlate with the field effect (F) of the ortho-substituent, revealing this feature to be responsible for the enhanced reactivity of these favored benzoates.Our studies of the Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation reaction uncovered an unexpected redox transmetalation step in this system. Synthesis and isolation of the proposed nickelacycle and Ag-aryl intermediates enabled direct study of the fundamental coupling steps. Catalytic and stoichiometric reactions of these complexes, paired with DFT calculations, supported a redox transmetalation step in which the Ag-aryl intermediate transfers the aryl ligand from AgI to NiII with concomitant oxidation to generate a NiIII-bis(aryl) intermediate.Finally, detailed mechanistic studies of our Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction demonstrated how this catalyst system is able to use O2 as the terminal oxidant. Kinetic studies paired with the synthesis and reactivity of well-defined copper intermediates revealed decarboxylation from a CuI-benzoate resting state, despite the oxidizing reaction conditions which could support higher oxidation state intermediates. We also identified the intermediacy of diphenyl disulfide (PhSSPh) formed from the thiophenol (PhSH) coupling partner under the aerobic Cu-catalyzed conditions. The reaction of PhSSPh with the catalyst proceeds via oxidative transfer of the PhS fragment to CuI that is analogous to that of the redox transmetalation observed in Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative arylation.These studies combined suggest significant implications for ODC reactions more broadly. For example, it appears that silver is important for mediating the decarboxylation step when the catalyst is unable (as is the case with nickel) but is not needed when the catalyst is an efficient decarboxylation mediator on its own (as with copper). Furthermore, silver plays an additional role in mediating an oxidative transfer of the coupling partner in arylation reactions but is not required when the coupling partner is itself oxidizing (such as PhSSPh). We anticipate that these mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of new ODC reactions that operate under milder conditions and with broader substrate scopes.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusMethodological development in the fields of genetics, chemical biology, and biochemistry over the last several decades has provided researchers with a diverse set of powerful tools to investigate biological processes. Leveraging these innovations in concert, scientists can now characterize biological pathways at a level of complexity ranging from systems biology down to molecular and atomic detail.Throughout this Account, we illustrate how discoveries made using these tools build on each other to develop a comprehensive understanding of biological pathways. Advancements in genetic sequencing facilitates association of genotypes and phenotypes, independent of biochemical mechanism. Through the biochemical reconstitution of the interactions between biological macromolecules─including the small molecules (ligands and metabolites) and proteins─that participate in these biological pathways, scientists can characterize the specific molecular features that link genotype and phenotype. This facilitates identification of targets within these pathways that can be manipulated to achieve a greater understanding of the biological process or to develop interventions to improve human health outcomes.Specifically, we describe how this toolbox was leveraged to discover and characterize the molecular biochemistry underlying control of pathogenicity in the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Concurrent with advancements in the investigative tools available to the scientific community, we and others reported on the genetic, molecular, and biochemical/biophysical components of this regulatory system. Virulence control in S. aureus is achieved through a chemical system of bacterial cell-to-cell communication indexed to local population density, referred to as quorum sensing (QS). We and our collaborators identified that this QS system is encoded in the accessory gene regulator (agr) operon and functions via the biosynthesis, secretion, and accumulation of a short peptide signaling molecule─the autoinducing peptide (AIP)─in the local environment correlated with the growth of S. aureus in the same biological niche. Above a threshold concentration, these AIPs bind and activate a cell-surface receptor to stimulate an intracellular response resulting in altered gene expression and bacterial group behaviors. We discovered that chemical modification of these AIPs often generates molecules that exhibit potent inhibition of agr QS, with demonstrated therapeutic potential to treat S. aureus infections. We went on to characterize the biochemical mechanism of signaling molecule biosynthesis and receptor activation in controlled systems through in vitro reconstitution of the constituent enzymes and substrates. Biochemical reconstitution enabled quantitative assessment of biophysical parameters. These efforts culminated in the comprehensive characterization and functional in vitro reconstitution of agr QS in a synthetic system in a minimal model at the interface of genotype, mechanism, and phenotype.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusPolymer self-assembly plays a crucial role across various fields, such as biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Over the years, self-assembly in solution has attracted significant interest. In 2007, our group, in collaboration with Prof. Ian Manners, published a groundbreaking article in Science on living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of amphiphilic block copolymers featuring a crystalline core-forming block. This study focused on polyferrocenylsilane block copolymers (PFS BCPs). Living CDSA operates similarly to living polymerization, enabling the precise fabrication of micelles with predictable shapes and dimensions. The crystalline nature of the core-forming block promotes the formation of structures with low interfacial curvature, such as cylinders and platelets, which are rarely formed in traditional self-assembly techniques based on microphase separation.Over the past two decades, we have pioneered a range of strategies to create one-dimensional (1D), 2D, 3D, and hierarchical uniform PFS BCP structures via CDSA. This method has also been extended to other semicrystalline polymer systems to produce regular and uniform assemblies. While 1D and 2D micelles have been extensively studied, the fabrication of 3D structures remains relatively rare. Nature, however, possesses exquisite 3D structures. Although CDSA has generated some 3D structures, it has not yet achieved the complexity found in nature. Researchers continue to push boundaries toward creating more intricate 3D structures.In this Account, we summarize our research advancements on 3D structure fabrication via CDSA. The free energy of the system, influenced by various factors, ultimately determines micellar morphology and growth behavior. Our work has led to the formation of branched structures through multistep seeded growth processes, incorporating PFS homopolymers (HP) with PFS BCP, manipulating the cooling rate, adjusting the corona block composition, controlling polymer dispersity, and varying solvents. Further innovations involved the use of organic sacrificial templates to produce hollow fiber-basket polymersomes and the application of inorganic substrates for surface micelle growth, yielding organic-inorganic hybrid materials with tailored functionalities. A significant breakthrough was the development of protocols for generating uniform polymeric spherulites and their precursors in solution. Although spherulites are common in bulk polymer materials and materials found in fields such as geology and biology, they have not been observed from block polymers in solution. We uncovered a novel CDSA mechanism in which defects in lamellar precursors act as a critical driver for constructing 3D architectures. To achieve intricate, bioinspired, and uniform 3D structures, further efforts will focus on enhancing structural control and integrating multifunctional properties.",

Nevertheless, the electropositive character of these elements and the resulting polarization of RE-C bonds, along with the intrinsic synergistic effects within metallacycles, endow RE metallacycles with unique properties and a rich, yet largely untapped, reaction chemistry. In this Account, we present the development and applications of five-membered RE metallacycles.Over the past decade, we have successfully synthesized a variety of five-membered all-carbon rare-earth metallacycles using two key synthetic strategies: (i) transmetalation, which has been employed to prepare RE metallacyclopentadienes and spiro-metallacyclopentadienes, which, featuring various ligand systems, provide distinct coordination environments around the RE center, significantly influencing their reactivity, and (ii) transmetalation and reduction, enabling the synthesis of RE spiro-metallacyclopentenes and 2-butene tetraanion (BTA)-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes. The reduction process proceeds via either self-disproportionation of metallacyclopentadienes or reduction by divalent RE centers or alkali metals. These metallacycles represent the first instances of such RE-containing metallacyclic ring structures.Our investigations into these metallacycles have uncovered unique reactivities and new reaction modes. The high intrinsic reactivity and multiple reactive sites of rare-earth metallacycles enable them not only to activate small molecules efficiently but also to exhibit distinct activation modes for some small molecules. For instance, reactions of RE metallacyclopentadienes with carbodiimides showcase diverse insertion/rearrangement chemistry, influenced by various factors such as number of equivalents of carbodiimide and the solvent choice. The RE metallacyclopentadiene-mediated [3 + 1] fragmentation of white phosphorus demonstrates an activation mode markedly different from that observed with main-group and transition metal analogs. Moreover, the discovery of cross-carbanion coupling at RE centers and RE-metal-mediated ring-opening metathesis of benzene introduces new reaction modes, demonstrating that, with rational design, RE metals can exhibit properties similar to or even surpassing those of transition metals. These reaction modes have further led to the development of applications for RE metallacycles in synthetic chemistry.Additionally, some novel properties of these rare-earth metallacycles have been uncovered, stemming from their unique geometric and electronic structures. Structural analysis and theoretical calculations have revealed the nonplanar aromaticity of BTA-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes, extending the concept of nonplanar aromaticity into the chemistry of carbon-RE metallacycles. Furthermore, benefiting from the redox capabilities of butadiene dianion and BTA ligands, the ligand-based redox chemistry of BTA-bridged dinuclear RE metallacyclopentenes demonstrates diverse and efficient multielectron transfer processes, highlighting the potential of these metallacycles for redox chemistry.The studies of rare-earth metallacycles, encompassing their construction, characterization, properties, reactivity, and synthetic applications, have greatly enriched the field of f-block metallacycles. We hope that this Account will inspire further exploration into the synthesis of new organometallic reagents and metallacycle-mediated transformations, fueling continued progress in rare-earth chemistry.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusIn recent years, multicomponent self-assembly has emerged as a pivotal strategy in supramolecular chemistry, enabling the construction of artificial systems with enhanced functionalities that surpass those of individual molecular components. These assemblies have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and biomedical engineering. However, achieving precise control over the assembly process remains a significant challenge, as increased structural complexity often results in thermodynamic mixtures, limiting their practical applications. In this context, metal-coordination-driven multicomponent self-assembly has emerged as a promising strategy, as the moderate strength and good directionality of metal-ligand bonds ensure the formation of discrete supramolecular architectures with well-defined structures and geometries. Notably, the integration of pyridyl and carboxylate donors with cis-Pt(II) nodes offers an effective approach for constructing multicomponent metallacages. This method is particularly attractive due to its ability to enable precise heteroleptic assembly, along with the accessibility and tunability of the ligands, which impart desirable photophysical properties and potential anticancer activities.This Account provides a comprehensive overview of our work on the design, preparation, and functionalization of multicomponent metallacages via the heteroleptic assembly of pyridyl and carboxylate ligands with cis-Pt(II) nodes. By strategically tailoring the ligand structures and adjusting the number of coordination sites, we have successfully constructed multicomponent metallacages with diverse geometries, including tetragonal and hexagonal prisms, triple-cavity ladders, truncated octahedra, and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, etc. In particular, we highlight the use of functional pyridyl ligands, such as tetraphenylethylene, hexaphenylbenzene, perylene diimide, and porphyrin derivatives, to explore the applications of these metallacages. Tetraphenylethylene and hexaphenylbenzene derivatives are propeller-shaped molecules with aggregation-induced emission properties, enhancing the emission of the metallacages both in solution and the solid state. Perylene diimide derivatives, with their electron-deficient, planar conjugated structures, contribute to strong emission in solution, thereby improving the host-guest chemistry and luminescent properties of the metallacages. Porphyrin derivatives, owing to their planar structures and excellent photosensitivity, endow the metallacages with significant photocatalytic capabilities. Additionally, other ligands, such as phenanthroline and triazine derivatives, have been employed to impart antibacterial and SO2 adsorption properties, respectively, to the metallacages. Furthermore, metallacage-cross-linked supramolecular networks exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and superior processability, making them promising candidates for functional materials. At the conclusion of this Account, we address the challenges and future perspectives in the development of multicomponent metallacages. We believe that ongoing research in this field will significantly advance the understanding of metal-coordination chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and the development of functional supramolecular materials.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusUltraviolet (UV) light has traditionally been used to drive photochemical organic transformations, mainly due to the limited visible-light absorption of most organic molecules. However, the high energy associated with UV light often causes undesirable side reactions. In the late 2000s, MacMillan, Yoon, and Stephenson pioneered the use of visible light in conjunction with photocatalysts (PCs) to initiate organic transformations. This innovative approach overcame the limitations of UV light by utilizing visible-light-absorbing PCs in their photoexcited states for electron or energy transfer, generating reactive radical species and promoting the photoreactions. Furthermore, while the photocatalysis has predominantly relied on transition-metal complexes, concerns over the potential toxicity, cost, and sustainability of these metals have driven the development of organic PCs. These organic PCs eliminate the need for metal removal, offer structural diversity, and enable tuning of their properties, thus paving the way for the creation of a tailored library of PCs.In recent decades, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel organic PCs with diverse scaffolds, with a notable example being the work of Zhang et al. in 2016. They demonstrated that cyanoarene analogues, originally developed by Adachi et al. for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in organic light-emitting diodes, could function effectively as PCs. Building on these insights, we developed a PC design platform featuring TADF compounds with twisted donor-acceptor structures, which paved the way for new PC discoveries. We showcased these PCs' ability (i) to generate long-lived lowest triplet excited (T1) states and (ii) to tune redox potentials by independently modifying donor and acceptor moieties. Through this platform, we discovered PCs with varying redox potentials and the capability to effectively populate T1 states, establishing structure-property relationships within our PC library and creating PC selection criteria for targeted reactions. Specifically, we tailored PCs for highly efficient reversible-deactivation radical polymerizations, including organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization, photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, and atom transfer radical polymerization with dual photoredox/copper catalysis as well as rapid free radical polymerizations. These advancements have also facilitated the development of functionalized, visible-light-cured adhesives for advanced display technologies. Furthermore, we investigated the origins of the exceptional catalytic performance of these PCs through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including electrochemical and photophysical measurements, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetics simulations. Specifically, we studied the formation and degradation of key PC intermediates in photocatalytic dehalogenations of alkyl and aryl halides. Our findings revealed a distinctive photodegradation pattern in the cyanoarene-based PCs, which significantly impact their catalytic efficiency in the reaction. Additionally, this discovery led us to introduce a concept of beneficial PC degradation for the first time.Over the past decades, organic photocatalysis based on the T1 state has become central to polymerization and organic synthesis. Utilizing our PC design platform, we have developed novel PCs and catalytic systems that enhance the overall efficiency of various organic transformations. In this overview of our contributions to visible-light-driven organic photocatalysis, we highlight the role of the T1 state in broadening applications through mechanistic analysis, enabling more sustainable transformations.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe challenge of optimizing decentralized water, wastewater, and reuse treatment systems calls for innovative, efficient technologies. One advancement involves surface-modified side-emitting optical fibers (SEOFs), which enhance biochemical and chemical light-driven reactions. SEOFs are thin glass or polymeric optical fibers with functionalized surfaces that can be used individually or bundled together. They can be attached to various light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers, which launch ultraviolet (UV) or visible light into the fibers. This light is then emitted along the fiber's surface, creating irradiance similar to a glow stick. The resulting SEOFs uniquely deliver light energy to complex environments while maximizing photon utilization and minimizing energy loss, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in photolysis and photocatalysis systems. SEOFs generate and leverage refracted light and evanescent waves to achieve continuous irradiation of their cladding, wherein photocatalysts are embedded. This method contrasts with traditional slurry-based systems, where light energy is often scattered or absorbed before reaching the reaction sites. Such scattering typically reduces quantum yields and reaction kinetics. In contrast, SEOFs create a controlled light delivery system that enhances reaction efficiency and adaptability to diverse applications.Important chemical and physical concepts are explored when scaling up SEOFs for three potential engineered applications. The selection of polymer materials and nanoparticle compositions is crucial for optimizing SEOFs as waveguides for visible to UV-C wavelengths and for embedding surface-accessible photocatalysts within porous polymer coatings on SEOF surfaces. Additionally, understanding how light propagates within SEOFs and emits along their exterior surface and length is essential for influencing the quantum yields of chemical products and enhancing biochemical sensitivity to low UV-C exposure. UV-C SEOFs are employed for germicidal disinfection, inactivating biofilms and pathogens in water systems. By overcoming UV light attenuation issues in traditional methods, SEOFs facilitate uniform distribution of UV-C energy, disrupting biofilm formation at early stages. SEOFs enhance UV-A and visible-light photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Embedding photocatalysts in porous polymer cladding enables simultaneous improvements in reaction kinetics and quantum yields. SEOFs enable decentralized light-driven production of clean energy resources such as hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, and formic acid, offering sustainable alternatives for off-grid systems.The design principles of SEOFs emphasize scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. Recent innovations in polymer chemistry, nanoparticle coatings, and surface roughness engineering have further optimized light delivery and side-emission. Tailoring the refractive index and nanoparticle distribution on fiber surfaces ensures precise evanescent wave propagation, enhancing photocatalytic performance. These advancements, coupled with scalable fabrication techniques, have positioned SEOFs as promising platforms for broad photochemical applications.By summarizing recent advances and identifying future needs, this Account positions SEOFs as a transformative approach to light-driven reactions, merging cutting-edge materials science with sustainable water treatment and energy production goals. This emerging technology offers immense potential to reshape photochemical processes for decentralized applications. Despite significant progress, challenges remain. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst loading, improving uniformity in side emissions, and enhancing polymer durability for long-term operational stability. Additionally, scaling SEOF configurations to multifiber bundles and integrating them into decentralized water systems will be critical for broader adoption.",

    "abstract": "ConspectusEnantioselective catalysts that exhibit broad generality are disruptive innovators in contemporary synthesis and are considered to be \"privileged\" on account of their expansive reactivity/selectivity profiles. Operating in the ground state, these species simultaneously regulate reactivity and orchestrate the translation of chiral information with exquisite efficiency: achieving parity in higher-energy (excited-state) scenarios remains a frontier in contemporary catalysis. Advancing this field will require new structure-activation guidelines to be delineated that reflect the energetic realities of achieving chiral induction in non-ground-state environments, thereby expediting the discovery of privileged photocatalysts. Earth-abundant aluminum-salen (Al-salen) complexes, which have a venerable history in ground-state enantioselective catalysis, show great promise in reconciling this disparity on account of their well-defined photophysical properties. In this Account, the potential of these catalysts in engaging various substrates via discrete activation modes to furnish optically enriched products with high levels of reliability is discussed. The deployment of commercial Al-salen complexes in the single electron transfer (SET)-enabled deracemization of cyclopropyl ketones is an exemplar. Irradiation of a commercial Al-salen complex augments the function of the catalyst to enable efficient deracemization (up to 98:2 e.r.), thereby eliminating the need for directing units. In stark contrast to conventional deracemization approaches that are predicated on C(sp3)-H deprotonation/reprotonation sequences, the transformation is characterized by a key C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond cleavage/cyclization process. Subsequent downstream manipulations of the enantioenriched products demonstrate the synthetic utility of the methodology. To illustrate mechanistic diversity using the same Al-salen complex, an enantioselective photocyclization under the auspices of energy transfer (EnT) catalysis is described. The photocyclization of acrylanilides under operationally simple conditions facilitates access to a diverse group of heterocyclic products (up to quantitative yield and 96:4 e.r.) using an Al-salen as the sole chiral operator. Collectively, these mechanistically distinct scenarios illustrate that light activation is a powerful strategy to augment the reactivity arsenal of a ubiquitous small molecule catalyst that is considered to be privileged in the ground state. The mechanistic foundations of reaction development are surveyed (combined experimental and computational approach), together with a perspective on the impact of this enabling technology in chiral functional molecule discovery. This Account serves to emphasize the synthetic utility of leveraging photochemical activation to mitigate intrinsic constraints of processes that might be considered to be thermochemically challenging.",

Among them, lanthanide-containing clusters (LCCs) are particularly notable for their aesthetically pleasing architectures and intriguing properties. Achieving precise synthesis and accurate structural characterization of these clusters is crucial for unlocking their potential applications. Mass spectrometry (MS), particularly electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), has proven to be a powerful tool, providing exceptional sensitivity and clarity in revealing the formation mechanisms and structural details of metal clusters. In this Account, we explore the synthesis, characterization, and assembly mechanisms of LCCs utilizing ESI-MS. We begin by tracing the historical development of LCCs, emphasizing the critical role of single-crystal X-ray diffraction in structural confirmation and the challenges associated with it. We then discuss the application of ESI-MS in characterizing LCCs, highlighting how this technique can monitor the formation processes of LCCs and determine their molecular weights and charge states. We introduce the mass difference fingerprint of isomorphism (MDFI) method, which can facilitate rapid analysis of LCCs' mass spectrometry data. Furthermore, we discuss the state of LCCs in solution and the challenges in their characterization. By utilizing ESI-MS, we enhance the understanding of the assembly mechanisms of LCCs and propose new strategies for designing and synthesizing new LCCs with tailored structures and functions. Looking forward, the ESI-MS method will play increasingly significant roles in LCC research. The continued development of these technologies will deepen the understanding of the structure-property relationships.

Arguably, the most general approach to their chemical synthesis involves the addition of metal carbenes to olefins. Whereas catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanations of electronically unbiased olefins with carbenoids have been reported using chiral metal complexes and engineered metalloenzymes, we now report a complementary, metal-free and highly enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with diazoalkanes, applying asymmetric counteranion-directed photoredox organocatalysis. We identify an ion pair featuring a thioxanthylium photoredox cation and a chiral imidodiphosphorimidate counteranion that catalyses highly enantioselective cyclopropanations of styrenes and aliphatic dienes with diazo compounds. Mechanistic investigations reveal a wavelength dependence of the enantioselectivity and suggest that the main catalytic pathway proceeds via olefin-derived radical cation intermediates. This metal-free, highly enantioselective organocatalytic approach complements previously reported methods for alkene manipulations.",

These unnatural enzymes are capable of synthesizing molecules that are either not amenable to biosynthesis or are extremely challenging to access chemically. PKSs can thus be a powerful platform to expand the chemical landscape beyond the limits of conventional metabolic engineering. Here we employ a retrobiosynthesis approach to design and construct PKSs to produce δ-valerolactam (VL) and three enantiopure α-substituted VL analogues that have no known biosynthetic route. We introduce the engineered PKSs and pathways for various malonyl-CoA derivatives into Pseudomonas putida and use proteomics, metabolomics and culture condition optimization to improve the production of our target compounds. These α-substituted VLs are polymerized into polyamides (nylon-5) or converted into their N-acryloyl derivatives. RAFT polymerization produces bio-derived polymers with potential biomedical applications. Overall, this interdisciplinary effort highlights the versatility and effectiveness of a PKS-based retrobiosynthesis approach in exploring and developing innovative biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSafety hazard induced by flammable electrolytes are troubling the advancement of practical sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Non‐flammable phosphate electrolytes are competent to address this issue, yet current designs struggle to balance the interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity due to the untamed interaction between Na+ and anion. Herein, we evaluate the effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on this interaction, revealing a systematic approach to achieve desired designs. It is shown that incorporating solvents with high DC and moderate Ea forms anion‐rich solvation structure for stabilizing the anode interface and achieving necessary salt dissociation for high ionic conductivity. Specifically, propylene carbonate is incorporated as the eligible solvent into triethyl phosphate, affording non‐flammable electrolytes with low cost and high ionic conductivity of 6.22 mS cm−1. Consequently, 1.25 Ah hard carbon (HC)|NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) pouch cell delivers a high‐power discharge of 5C rate and maintains an impressive capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, 6.61 Ah HC|NFM pouch cell with 152.3 Wh kg−1 avoids smoke production and volume expansion during nail penetration. This work discloses an advanced strategy for deigning practical phosphate electrolytes, paving the way for developing high‐performance SIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal‐based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton‐like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant‐induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer route, generating surface‐bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low‐valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe‐Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst‐phenol interaction towards self‐activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14‐time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order‐of‐magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100‐day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst‐pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.",

However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, break from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain‐branched dual‐ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3 mW cm‐2. In‐situ ultraviolet‐visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual‐ammonium structure accelerates ~40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high‐energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco‐friendliness, durability, and sustainability.",

However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid‐assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered‐spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered‐spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1 C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26 mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi‐strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMelanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane‐bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell‐SELEX and cell‐internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT‐1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT‐1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT‐1e, we engineered an aptamer‐based molecular tethering agent TTe‐TTe. We found that TTe‐TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe‐TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm‐shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C═O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single‐atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p‐xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO‐66‐NH2‐A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr‐oxo nodes of UiO‐66‐NH2 to form Cu–O–Zr sites. The Cu–O–Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro‐deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36 h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu–O–Zr sites also drives the reaction process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO‐aminophenol oxidases, a specialized subclass of type‐III copper proteins, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive nitrosophenols, which display antiretroviral and blood cholesterol‐lowering activity. Another related subclass of type‐III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o‐aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o‐aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o‐aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso‐forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL‐24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso‐forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso‐forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o‐aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.",

In this work, we introduce a center‐chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to overcome this limitation. By integrating a stereogenic carbon center into a fluorene scaffold, we create a unique interaction between a boron‐based multi‐resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) Lewis acid and an arylamine Lewis base. This sterically hindered design prevents strong charge transfer while optimizing the alignment between electric and magnetic dipole moments for amplified CPL signals. Our OLEDs achieve impressive electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) of 6.64 × 10−3, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 30.4%, and sub‐30 nm spectral linewidths. These improvements yield a Figure of Merit (FoM = EQE × |gEL|) of 1.91 × 10−3, the highest reported for center‐chiral CPL devices. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the center‐chiral FLP design in overcoming the long‐standing trade‐off between polarization and efficiency in CPL devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractB←N containing polymers have emerged in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties. Despite these advantages, the development of B←N‐based n‐type polymers for high‐performance organic transistors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective B←N containing acceptor units. In this work, we address this challenge through the rational design and synthesis of two asymmetric half‐fused B←N functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives, BTBN and FBTBN. These compounds leverage the unique electronic properties of the B←N motif, enabling the development of two new n‐type polymers, PBTBN and PFBTBN. Notably, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBTBN and PFBTBN are significantly lowered by 0.2–0.3 eV compared to their counterparts without B←N functionalization, with PFBTBN achieving a LUMO of ∼ −4.0 eV. Importantly, PFBTBN exhibits exceptional unipolar n‐type transistor performance with a high electron mobility (µe) of 3.85 cm2 V−1 s−1. The asymmetric half‐fused B←N molecular backbone not only stabilizes the electronic structure but also induces a near‐amorphous morphology, thereby enabling PFBTBN‐based flexible transistors to retain a high µe of 3.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 even after 1000 bending cycles. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of incorporating asymmetric B←N functionalized acceptors for high‐performance n‐type semiconducting polymers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3‐butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy‐intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure–performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu‐MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as‐designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3‐MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C–C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3‐butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3‐butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3‐MOF affords a 1,3‐butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3‐butadiene production rate of 64 mmol g−1 h−1, which is about 2‐fold and 20‐fold higher than Cu2‐MOF and Cu1‐MOF.

Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways leading from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C─C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO to form CH2CO, identified as the rate‐determining step in the formation of C2+ products. These findings deepen the understanding of the C─C coupling processes, which are crucial for advancing catalyst development in electrochemical CO2 upgrading.",

Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen‐deficient TiO2 under an air‐level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31 mg gcat−1 h−1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen‐free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to •NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen‐derived O2•–. This •NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air‐level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to •NH2 while preventing over‐oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSuppressing the defects from SnO2 and perovskite interface is essential for the fabrication of large‐area n–i–p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the needed lifetime and efficiency for commercialization. Here, we report the employment of l‐citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (─COOH, ─NH2) and urea (─NH─CO─NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I−. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain‐size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive δ phase to result in suppressed trap‐assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent‐free slot‐die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.",

Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co‐containing Li‐rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high‐voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice‐coherent Li‐rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high‐voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li‐rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6 V and even at 4.7 V.

Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron‐affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose‐dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene‐functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2‐Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4‐nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia‐selective toxicity arises from reductase‐mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2‐Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen‐mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways.

    "abstract": "AbstractRechargeable zinc metal batteries (RZMBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high capacity and cost‐effectiveness. However, their commercialization is hindered by challenges including dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation, particularly under low current densities and negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratios. Localized high‐concentration electrolytes offer potential solutions, but their reliance on high salt concentrations to replicate solvation structures of high‐concentration electrolytes limits their practicality, due to diluent's inherent inertness that limits its role in interfacial chemistry. Here, we present a co‐regulation strategy that integrates bulk and interfacial properties to develop an interfacial‐enhanced localized high‐concentration electrolyte (ILHCE). By incorporating non‐coordinating 1,4‐dioxane diluent and 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium (emim+) cations into dilute aqueous electrolytes, dioxane molecules are pulled into electric double layer (EDL) through the interaction between emim+ and dioxane, achieving a pronounced dilution effect from bulk electrolyte to the EDL. This generates an anion‐rich and water‐depleted EDL at both anode and cathode interfaces, enhancing Zn2+ transport dynamics, ensuring cathode stability and deriving a robust anion‐derived solid‐electrolyte interphase. Full batteries using Mn0.5V6O13 cathodes with a low N/P ratio of 1.77 demonstrate 80% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, highlighting ILHCE as a transformative electrolyte design toward real‐world applications.",

The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46 A mgPd−1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12 A mgPd−1) and Pt/C (0.17 A mgPt−1).

Experimental and Density Functional Theory calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd–Co–P interfaces could direct the two‐dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film‐like Li2O2 products.

    "abstract": "AbstractSolid‐state electrolytes (SSEs) have emerged as high‐priority materials for ensuring the safe operation of solid‐state lithium (Li) batteries. However, current SSEs still face challenges of balancing stability and ionic conductivity, which limits their practical applications in solid‐state Li batteries. Here, we report a general strategy for achieving high‐performance SSEs by constructing a Li+‐conducted polymeric metal–organic nanocapsule (PolyMONC(Li)) network through molecular design. With the unique cage structure and pore size, metal–organic nanocapsule (MONC) can achieve excellent anion confinement effects. The PolyMONC(Li) network with continuous Li+ conduction pathways serves as a solid electrolyte exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (0.18 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.83). Combining the two superiorities of optimal balance between mechanical strength and excellent Li+ conductivity, the PolyMONC(Li) can still restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short‐circuiting even over 900 h cycling. The PolyMONC(Li)‐based SSEs Li‐metal batteries achieved a higher specific capacity than common polymer electrolytes such as polyethylene oxide‐based SSE. Additionally, taking advantage of the PolyMONC(Li) electrode binder, the solid‐state Li–O2 battery achieves a stable cycling over 400 cycles. This work provides a comprehensive guideline for developing porous solids from molecule design to practical application.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSkeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles represents a straightforward approach to rapidly expand the accessible chemical space. While notable progress has been made on the direct modification of various nitrogen‐ and oxygen‐heterocycles, editing of prevalent sulfur‐containing heteroarenes, especially for single‐atom insertion, remains exceedingly rare. This disparity is primarily attributed to the sulfur atom's inherent nucleophilicity and high susceptibility to oxidation. Here we present a conceptually distinct photocatalytic strategy that enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes, furnishing previously inaccessible cyclic thioborane scaffolds and synthetically valuable alkyl boronates in an efficient manner. Furthermore, mechanistic studies have revealed that the boron insertion step proceeds through an unprecedented mechanism.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the –water interface is considered to be the bottleneck of the overall water splitting at this aqueous interface. To provide insight into the mechanism of this reaction, the focus is set on the first proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET). The free‐energy surface of this first step is obtained by combining on‐the‐fly probability‐enhanced sampling and machine learning potentials at the hybrid functional level of accuracy. Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent with kinetic‐isotope‐effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to  eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom. The presented framework can be generally applied to other PCET steps and other oxides, thus opening the door to a comprehensive investigation of the OER mechanism at oxide–water interfaces.",

This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single‐atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S‐FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)‐like activity. Synthesized via low‐temperature carbonization, S‐FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC‐STEM. The POD‐specific activity of S‐FeCDs reached 295 U mg−1, which is 11.2‐fold higher than that of sulfur‐free FeCDs, with natural enzyme‐like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the ΔG for H2O2‐to‐·OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate‐determining step (2*OH → *O + *H2O) from 2.50 to 1.62 eV. In vivo, S‐FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA‐infected wound models, achieving near‐complete healing within 7 days. The proton driving mechanism was further validated through nitro compound reduction, demonstrating accelerated N─H bond activation. This work highlights the critical role of sulfur‐induced proton dynamics in enhancing SAEs performance, providing a rational strategy for designing multifunctional nanozymes in biomedical and catalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConjugated radical polymers (RPs) with polyradical structures in an π‐conjugated polymeric backbone have the potential to serve as both model molecules for spin‐correlated condensed matters and as materials for optoelectronics and spin‐based quantum applications. However, preparing RPs of this type with high stability and spin‐delocalized nature presents a significant challenge. We report herein two ambient‐stable conjugated RPs (RPH and RPC), synthetically obtained by an unprecedented straightforward copolymerization of two brominated diradical monomers (diradical characters up to 0.88) with bis‐stannylated DPP units. Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open‐shell ground state, the diradical‐derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin‐delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of S = 1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near‐infrared absorptions beyond 1000 nm, multi‐stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing π‐paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin‐film state RPH exhibited superior ambipolar carrier‐transporting properties with well‐balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as attractive room‐temperature quantum coherence times (T1 = 1.88 µs, T2 = 218 ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations. This study introduces a facile approach for constructing stable conjugated RPs, along with their integrated electronic and spin properties.",

Herein, we investigate the crystallization of the amino acid L‐Cysteine and show that both the structure of the crystal and its intrinsic fluorescence can be drastically altered by the solvent. Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (dDNP) is a powerful hyperpolarization technique enabling sensitivity gains beyond 4 orders of magnitude in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Over the last decades, researchers' efforts have led to an extension of dDNP applications in numerous research fields. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widespread types of rechargeable batteries, which calls for a deeper understanding of the various physicochemical mechanisms involved in making them more efficient, safe, and sustainable. One of the key challenges lies in better understanding the degradation of the battery electrolyte to mitigate it, as it can significantly impact the battery's performance. While NMR has been used in attempts to understand these mechanisms, notably by investigating the degradation products, the intrinsic lack of sensitivity of this technique, combined with the limited accessible volume of such compounds, makes its application often challenging. In this work, we combine several state-of-the-art dDNP methodologies, including the use of recently introduced hyperpolarizing polymers (HYPOPs), to acquire hyperpolarized 13C NMR spectra of battery electrolytes. We show that we can successfully detect 13C signals on formulated battery electrolyte solutions in different degradation stages on a 600 MHz spectrometer, with sensitivity gains of up to 3 orders of magnitude. This work paves the way for studying lithium-ion battery electrolyte degradation under real usage conditions (cycling, thermal aging, air exposure, etc.) with a 13C detection limit below the micromolar range. This methodology has the potential to provide new insights into degradation mechanisms and the role and effectiveness of additives to mitigate electrolyte degradation.",

    "abstract": "Rationally designing nanostructures and comprehensively understanding the structure-property relationships are important for directional charge transfer. A general dual-interface built-in electric field (BIEF) regulation strategy is developed to synthesize the bifunctional ZnS/Sv-chalcogenide/Ti3C2 heterostructure photocatalysts (Sv represents sulfur vacancies; chalcogenides include ZnIn2S4, CdS, and CdIn2S4) consisting of a ZnS/chalcogenide S-scheme heterojunction and a Sv-chalcogenide/Ti3C2 Schottky heterojunction. The ternary-component photocatalyst construction involves hollow core-shell heterostructure establishment via lateral epitaxy and chalcogenide-surface Ti3C2 nanoparticle introduction via a defect-mediated heterocomponent anchorage. These nanoreactors integrate the strong intrinsic driving force and enhanced interfacial electronic coupling, leveraging resulting dual-interface BIEFs for precise carrier mobility control and robust redox performance feedback. The BIEF-induced ultrafast charge transfer features powerful photocarrier enrichment and feeble photocarrier recombination at the ZnS/ZnIn2S4 S-scheme heterointerface as well as continuous steering of photocarrier localization and delocalized electron transport at the Sv-ZnIn2S4/Ti3C2 Schottky heterointerface. Simultaneously, BIEF-induced targeted molecule catalysis is marked by complementary adsorption and selective activation of key intermediates. Representative ZnS/Sv-ZnIn2S4/Ti3C2 demonstrates broad substrate compatibility and superhigh reactivity in cooperative biomass valorization and hydrogen evolution. This study provides a programmable framework for manipulating BIEFs by multicomponent ordered-space integration and interface engineering, elucidating the substantial impact of dual-interface BIEFs on carrier transport behavior and molecular catalytic behavior.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS) are expected to produce groundbreaking technologies in computing, sensing, and communications. These developments could have an impact on the economy and workforce of the United States. In order to achieve this vision and sustain U.S. leadership in QIS, however, a robust research enterprise needs to be established. Presently, QIS has reached an inflection point for new discoveries; searching for novel quantum molecular materials that are operational, practical, and efficient is now the new frontier. Since chemistry is the study of manipulating molecular properties across different lengths and time-scales, it has a tremendous opportunity to take a leading role in this untapped domain. Blending QIS and chemistry together will accelerate progress in designing new quantum molecular materials, developing novel measurement tools and techniques, and establishing new quantum computing standards. A recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report, Advancing Chemistry and Quantum Information Science, points to fundamental research areas at the interface of these two disciplines that should be pursued in the near-term. Here, a brief overview of these research directions as well as collaboration and infrastructure needs identified from the report are presented.",

The reaction proceeds instantaneously, even at ‐35 °C, resulting in the quantitative conversion of methylene‐bis‐DTPS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of ∆Gr confirm the synthetic feasibility and regioselectivity, attributing the efficiency to strain release in DTPS rings and entropic gain from thiirane elimination. The resulting 2',3'‐cNTDPs exhibited remarkable hydrolytic stability and greater solution structural rigidity than free nucleosides.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic disulfide bonds offer a promising avenue for developing robust and reversible photocatalysts. This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly‐SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly‐SS features linear disulfide‐containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly‐SS demonstrates the exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2‐diketones, achieving >99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly‐SS, enabling facile thin‐film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide‐linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNature's molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light‐driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light‐driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric‐driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light‐induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light‐driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.",

Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late‐stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy‐level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site‐selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group.

The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d‐d transitions and possible metal‐to‐metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared (NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV–cut off (85–90%), which indicates possible use as UV‐NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3–5 times higher than KDP. The dielectric studies indicated reasonable values for the dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long‐term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations, which support the findings of the experimental investigations.

    "abstract": "AbstractMechanochemical synthesis has emerged as a powerful and more sustainable alternative to conventional solution‐based methods, offering advantages such as no or only minimal solvent use, reduced reaction times, and simplified operational conditions. The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one‐pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one‐pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one‐pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of robust chiroptical systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2‐symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five‐fold enhancement of the g‐factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine‐tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high‐performance chiroptical materials.",

The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P═Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P═Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2.

Herein, novel reductive carbon dots (r‐CDs) were successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that r‐CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r‐CDs exhibit remarkable preservation effects on apples and strawberries and significantly extend their shelf‐life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon‐core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process. More interestingly, the reducibility of r‐CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N‐doped CDs (N‐CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material‐controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development of non‐toxic, efficient carbon nano‐antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material‐controlled synthesis.",

Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid‐treated conditions, and also allows real‐time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER.

Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the “best” reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning models. In addition, comparing the machine learning models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi‐catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.",

All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, UV–Visible (UV‐Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF‐7. Wound healing assays were conducted to assess cytotoxicity and cell migration under QD treatment. Results showed that both coated and uncoated QDs influenced wound closure rates in a concentration‐ and time‐dependent manner. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed significant green luminescence of CdSe:Eu quantum dots (QDs) in both HaCaT and MCF‐7 cell lines, indicating efficient cellular uptake. The internalization of QDs was influenced by their surface properties and charge, suggesting an endocytic uptake pathway.",

The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(η3‐P4R2L)]+ (1a – d) and [Cp'''Ni(η1:1‐P4R2L)]+ (3a – d) show different geometries for the L‐P3PR2 ligands.

Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene‐linked COFs termed g‐TDM‐COF and g‐TBD‐COF, respectively.  The methoxyl substituents pended on the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over 8‐fold enhancement of photocatalytic H2O2 production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500 nm. Such phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen‐bond interaction, thus favorable for broading light‐harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity, As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.",

Currently, oil‐soluble nanoparticles represent an under‐researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesizing organic nanoparticles with higher‐order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil‐soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self‐assembly of polyester‐based BCPs in n‐octane to achieve low‐dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tunable, oil‐soluble polymers and aims to understand their self‐assembly in n‐octane through the variation of self‐assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.",

However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in under achievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focusses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides towards capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides along with future directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio‐economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive and specific in situ virus detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)‐based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN‐based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV‐RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV‐RNA within 12 min in a cell‐free environment, enabling real‐time imaging of JEV‐RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN‐based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.",

During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first‐shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chain.",

Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real‐time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities, enhancing the understanding of human biosystem. Since they are cost‐effective and user‐friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors.  Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area, tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhances their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focussing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in‐depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute towards enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics.",

Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti‐counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low‐molecular‐weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent‐colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf‐like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via π‐electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.",

In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron‐oxygen (B─O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom‐doped molecule, BNB‐OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation‐directed, lithium‐free methodology, achieving an impressive one‐pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB‐OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi‐planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long‐range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB‐OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B─O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom‐doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH‐based blue‐light OLED applications.",

However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N‐methylpyrrolidine (AlH3·(NMP)x) and the Al NC synthesis outcomes . Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3·(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3·(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3·(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of H3Al·(NMP)1.0 through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. Importantly, H3Al·(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well‐defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased polydispersity and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.",

This method eliminates the need for laborious temperature changes and cryogenic conditions, and significantly reduces the process time from starting material to products. Compared to traditional batch processes, our flow approach enables the use of a single organolithium reagent and operates efficiently at 0 °C, avoiding the cool-warm-cool temperature cycles typical of batch methods. This not only simplifies the workflow but also enhances practicality, scalability, and extends the accessible chemical space.",

The nucleophilic addition of trimethyl phosphite or dimethyl phenylphosphonite to chiral N-acyliminium ions affords the diastereoisomers, which are easily separated by column chromatography.

There are two main methods for producing monofluorinated compounds: forming C–F bonds using fluorinating agents, or creating C–C bonds with fluorinated substrates. The latter method boasts a wider range of applicable substrates. We will discuss reactions involving various substrates, including NFSI, KHF2, Selectfluor, FABI, Et3N·3HF, COF2, ICH2F, DAST and others.

This modular approach has enabled the efficient synthesis of four natural products: ethericin A, ethericin B, C10-deoxygerfelin, and diorcinol.",

    "abstract": "1,3-diols, which are a frequent motif in biologically active molecules, can be prepared from readily available allylic alcohols via formal anti-Markovnikov hydration. The commonly employed hydroboration-oxidation sequence for the synthesis of terminal alcohols is challenging for allylic alcohols, and O-protection of the alcohol can be necessary. To increase atom economy, we explored the use of silane protecting groups that can be engaged in intramolecular hydrosilylation. Oxidative cleavage of the cyclized product yields the desired 1,3-diol and obviates the need for super-stoichiometric borane reagents. Based on a detailed study of O-silylation conditions, a protocol is presented that furnishes quantitative yields of a wide range of O-silylated alcohols which contain Si–H bonds for further functionalization. We show that a MOF-based Rh(II) porphyrin can furnish efficient intramolecular hydrosilylation while the corresponding homogeneous analogue proved unreactive. Radical trapping studies suggest that silyl radicals constitute key intermediates in Rh(II) catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation. Preferential 5-endo-trig versus 6-exo-trig cyclization and 5-exo-trig versus 6-endo-trig cyclization of the silyl radical intermediates led to chemoselective 1,3-diol formation for substrates containing multiple olefins.",

Modifying the ferrocene core and its side chains is crucial for fine-tuning its redox properties, solubility, and stability, thereby enhancing its performance in various applications. This review discusses the synthesis of ferrocene compounds potentially relevant to electrochemical applications, focusing on recent strategies for nondirected C–H functionalization of the ferrocene core and diverse reactions for side-chain modifications. Advances in C–H activation of ferrocenes have been facilitated by catalytic methods utilizing Pd, Ir, Au, In, and Fe catalysts, as well as through photoredox and electrochemical techniques. Furthermore, side chains are modified via a range of mild transformations compatible with the ferrocene core, including substitution and annulation. These advancements in synthesizing ferrocene derivatives have broadened their potential applications, notably as electron-transfer mediators, energy-storage systems, and sensors.1 \tIntroduction2 \tNondirected C–H Activation of Ferrocene and Its Derivatives3 \tSide-Chain Modification of Ferrocene Derivatives4 \tApplications of Ferrocene Derivatives in Electrochemistry5 \tConclusion",

The presented approach effectively managed critical impurities and achieved impressive yields of 98, 84, and 78% with purity >99% in the hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediate, and final API, respectively. The improved synthesis was optimized and scaled for multi-kilogram batches, addressing challenges from previous methods and yielding ICH quality material in 65% overall yield.",

One industrial application for HAT can be found in the tertiary benzylic C–H bond of cumene for producing phenol, a versatile chemical feedstock for various industries. However, the overall phenol yield remains low using the existing Hock process due to the poor selectivity towards the key reaction intermediate, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for phenol production through photooxidation of cumene to CHP using iron bromide under blue light irradiation, where bromine radicals (generated in situ via ligand-to-metal charge transfer) are used as hydrogen atom abstractors. Mechanistic studies revealed the cumene-to-CHP conversion occurred via a tertiary C–H bond abstraction by a radical mechanism, and the acetic acid and water additives increased CHP selectivity through stabilizing peroxides. The cumene-phenol process achieved up to 88% yield of CHP in 1 hour and could be used with a wide range of substrates. We thus developed a selective, mild, and efficient phenol production method using iron bromide under photooxidative conditions.",

The efficient utilization of carbon dioxide as a carbon resource requires the development of effective and straightforward synthetic strategies for C–C bond transformations. Recent studies have focused on transition-metal-catalyzed coupling reactions of carbon dioxide with soft nucleophiles such as alkynes, conjugated dienes, and various unsaturated hydrocarbons, demonstrating the formation of unsaturated carboxylic acids. This article describes carbon dioxide fixation reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons promoted by Ni and Cu catalysts that we have recently developed. Notably, these reactions feature highly regio- and stereoselective C–C bond formation facilitated by key intermediates involving organometalloids.",

However, the gaseous nature of these reagents, along with their intrinsic inertness due to their high bond-dissociation energies (99-105 kcal·mol-1), have rendered traditional strategies ineffective or lacking in selectivity. The use of flow chemistry technology, nonetheless, has made a tremendous impact in this field, improving the efficiency of multiphasic processes through improved mass transfer and larger interfacial areas. In this work, we report a new flow chemistry platform for the photocatalytic hydroalkylation of trifluoromethyl alkenes with both isobutane and n-butane.

Originally reported in a racemic fashion by Molander and Doyle, this transformation was re-examined using chiral bis(oxazoline) ligands, revealing distinct enantioselectivity trends depending on the halogen present in the aryl halide and Ni pre-catalyst. Stoichiometric experiments demonstrated that the Ni(II) oxidative addition complex is primarily responsible for trapping the THF radical, while multivariate linear regression modeling confirmed that the halide remains coordinated during the enantiodetermining step. Time-course experiments uncovered an alternative initial pathway when Ni(0) was used as the pre-catalyst, which ultimately converged to the main Ni(II) pathway. EPR analysis further revealed rapid comproportionation between Ni(0) and Ni(II), forming Ni(I) species that engage in radical trapping at early stages, accounting for the observed reactivity differences. By integrating enantioselectivity data with experimental techniques such as EPR spectroscopy, this study establishes enantioinduction analysis as a powerful tool for mechanistic investigations in Ni photochemical catalysis. The insights gained not only refine our understanding of this transformation, but also provide a framework for probing similar Ni/Ir dual photocatalytic systems.1 \tIntroduction2 \tEnantioselectivity Data Highlights a Complex Mechanistic Scenario3 \tProbing the Predominant Pathway with Stoichiometric Experiments4 \tMLR Modeling to Understand the Halogen Effect on the Enantioinduction5 \tProposed Prevalent Mechanism6 \tInitiation with Ni(0) Precatalyst7 \tConclusion",

X-ray analysis and DFT calculations have revealed that the key step, the IMDDA reaction, proceeds via an exo transition allene state, resulting in the exclusive formation of a single isomer of the target heterocycle.",

These radicals, acting as small molecular magnets, exhibit sensitivity to minute magnetic fields and can be tailored with diverse spin centers, making them ideal for spin-optical interfaces, representing key components in quantum communication systems. Furthermore, their ability to form organized, higher-dimensional assemblies presents a promising avenue for overcoming scalability challenges in quantum technologies. Despite their potential, achieving high luminescence quantum yields has largely been limited to donor-functionalized monoradicals, and a detailed understanding of the luminescent behavior of open-shell organic molecules remains elusive. This review delves into the photoluminescent properties and spin ground states of trityl-based mono-, di-, and multiradicals, examining the strategies employed to enhance their performance. Additionally, we review predictive methods for determining the luminescence and spin states of radicals, highlighting critical unresolved questions that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of trityl-based radicals in advanced technological applications.",

Most of these compounds are based on complex D–A–D structures or multi-D–A systems, such as 4CzIPN. Whereas these systems have been widely studied and applied as photocatalysts, simpler D–A structures remain less explored. Nevertheless, the simplicity of D–A structures makes them the ideal structures to further understand the structure–property relationship of D–A molecules for optimizing their photocatalytic performance by simpler modification of the different D–A subunits. In particular, D–A structures featuring sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors have gained increasing attention for their use as photoredox catalysts. This study introduces a new family of D–A molecules by exploring various sulfur-based acceptors and nitrogen donors, including a novel tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) unit and 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine (IMD). Our findings demonstrate that these simple D–A structures exhibit promising photocatalytic properties, comparable to those of more complex D–A–D systems.",

This review categorizes recent literatures focusing on key regulatory factors for product divergent formation, in which controlling chemical selectivity primarily relies on ligands, metal catalysts, solvents, time, temperature, acids/bases, and subtle modifications of substrates. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying reaction activity and selectivity differentiation, the review provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms of critical steps through specific case studies.

We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance. We suggest first steps that researchers can take to move towards a positive culture of data sharing in organic chemistry.

    "abstract": "The dual-host strategy offers a straightforward approach to ion separation, yet the nature of cooperative interactions between receptor-complexed cations and anions remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilize 18-crown-6 as a cation receptor and a tripodal hexaurea receptor L as an anion receptor to extract cesium salts (chloride, nitrate, carbonate, sulfate, and phosphate) from the solid phase into chloroform. Remarkably, Cs3PO4 exhibits the highest extraction efficiency, driven by strong cooperative interactions involving ion-dipole coordination between Cs+ and carbonyl (C=O) groups, as well as direct ion-pairing interactions between 18-crown-6-complexed Cs+ and hexaurea-bound PO43−. Single-crystal structural analysis corroborates these interactions, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and providing valuable guidance for the rational design of advanced dual-host systems for selective ion separation.",

This is paramount as electronic effects play a crucial role in the behavior of photoswitches and a deeper understanding enables their straightforward development for specific applications. In this work, we synthesized novel N-acylpyrazole-based photoswitches and conducted a comparative study with 33 phenylazopyrazoles, comparing their photoswitching properties and the impact of electronic effects.

In this article, we report the synthesis of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,3-diones via a reversible transimination reaction between Schiff’ base (C=N) linkage-containing pyrrolidine-2,3-dione derivatives and methylamine with yields of 80 to 92%. In addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-diphenylpyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5a) was also verified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized molecules were evaluated for compliance with established drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, Egan, and Muegge), as well as ADMET properties. All compounds satisfied these criteria, indicating favorable oral bioavailability. Molecular docking analysis showed that compounds 5a–e act as ligands for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), especially with Cys200 and Ser242 via hydrogen bonds. In addition, van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the ligand–iNOS complexes. In particular, 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-5-phenyl-1-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5e) exhibited the strongest binding affinity (−9.51 kcal/mol) and demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production, with an IC50 value of 43.69 ± 5.26 µM. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (-NO2 group) on the benzene ring at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine-2,3-dione subunit in compound 5e may be responsible for the observed high inhibition activity due to the enhancement and optimization of hydrogen bonding with Cys200. These results underscore the potential of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidenepyrrolidine-2,3-diones, especially compound 5e, as promising scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting iNOS-related pathologies.",

A full catalytic cycle for the enantioselective synthesis of α-hydrazinonitriles is proposed based on insights gained from DFT calculations. Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) has been used as a sacrificial cyanide source. We found that isocyanide (rather than cyanide) is a preferred coordination to calcium during the catalytic cycle, while the active catalyst prefers a side-on coordination of cyanide. The configuration-determining step is a hydrocyanation via a calcium isocyanide complex, whereas the rate-limiting step is that which recovers the calcium catalyst and replaces the TMS-bound product from the catalyst. While our experimental data demonstrate enantioselectivity values as high as 89% under certain conditions, the overall enantioselectivity achieved with the calcium catalyst remains modest, mainly due to competing pathways for the Z- and E-hydrazone isomers leading to opposite enantiomers. The experimental results confirm these computational proposals.",

Selective saponification of the isobutyrate is also achieved with crude pig liver esterase, leading to tagitinol C in moderate yield. Heliangine from the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and hydroxylated derivatives of tagitinin C from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), two abundant field crops, constitute alternative sources of germacranolide derivatives not accessible from tagitinin C.

Several synthetic pathways and only one biocatalytic approach have been designed over the years. However, no chemoenzymatic approaches have been described to date. Herein, the first two‐step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase‐catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16 h using eco‐friendly t‐amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4 h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.",

In contrast, in the case of the 1,4‐diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron‐rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out.",

Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate activator substituents for allowing the process, the impact of different reaction parameters, and characterizes the various byproducts that are generated in the reaction. We have tested the reaction using a commercially available batch system and flow apparatus, achieving maximum yields of >90% (batch) for mono‐ and of 6% (batch) and 9% (flow) for the gem‐difluorinated proline model. These proof‐of‐concept results indicate that the flow approach is more efficient, but that different activating substituents will be needed to achieve higher yields",

While (H)TPQs are typically non‐emissive and potentially open‐shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the π‐conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium‐containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena‐hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO‐LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia‐analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) and thiaradialene (1.58 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low‐lying LUMO energy levels.",

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3‐pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre‐activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3‐pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3‐pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre‐activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4‐disubstituted 3‐pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3‐pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations.",

Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh3, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by‐product from alkyne.

Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single‐carbon‐atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five‐membered carbon‐ and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six‐membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven‐membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo‐ and electro‐catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single‐carbon‐atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology.",

Nevertheless, thermal activation remains mandatory in most cases, which may decrease the compatibility with sensitive functional groups. In this context, improvements of conventional strategies must be an important source of research in order to enhance the applicability of such methods for building complex scaffolds. In this work, we contribute to this aim by implying visible‐light as the sole energy source in a Pd‐catalyzed rearrangement reaction involving N‐tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. These mild reaction conditions efficiently allow oxidative addition, aryl migration and β‐hydride elimination at room temperature, allowing the construction of various 1,1’ disubstituted olefins.",

The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerating various groups such as ethers, sulfides and halogens, and delivers high yields under mild conditions, even at gram scale. The resulting Bpin‐functionalized naphthalenes serve as versatile building blocks, facilitating further transformations of the C−B bond into C−H, C−C, C−I, C−O, and C−N bonds, thereby increasing molecular complexity and enabling the design of more functionalized products. Notably, this sustainable and straightforward protocol selectively introduces the Bpin group at the sterically hindered α‐carbon of the naphthalene framework, complementing C–H borylations of the naphthalene core, that preferentially occur at the β‐position. As a result, the developed approach significantly broadens the accessibility of B‐functionalized naphthalene derivatives for synthetic and application‐oriented purposes.",

In this review, we summarize the coupling reactions of three types of α,β‐unsaturated ketoximes with various organic compounds containing unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles and so on over the past decades. The reaction conditions, selected examples of the reaction scope, limitations, and reasonable mechanisms are critically described.

    "abstract": "The structural diversity and good biocompatibility of cyclic peptides have led to their emergence as potential therapeutic agents. Existing cyclic peptide design methods, whether traditional or emerging AI-assisted, rely on a multitude of experiments and face challenges such as limited molecular diversity, high cost, and time-consuming. In this study, we propose HighPlay, which integrates reinforcement learning (MCTS) with the HighFold structural prediction model to design cyclic peptide sequences based solely on the target protein sequence information, to achieve the synergistic optimization of cyclic peptide sequences and binding sites and to dynamically explore the sequence space without the need for predefined target information. The model was applied to the design of cyclic peptide sequences for three different targets, which were screened and verified through molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating good binding affinity. Specifically, the cyclic peptide sequences designed for the TEAD4 target exhibited micromolar-level affinity in further experimental validation.",

Besides, this compound displayed potent antiviral activity against EV71. Compared to FB2001, 28f displayed better pharmacokinetic properties, and the value of oral bioavailability in CD-1 mice and Beagle dogs was improved to 10.4 and 10.2%, respectively. In addition, oral treatment with 28f could significantly reduce the viral loads of HCoV-OC43 in mice, and compound 28f could also effectively reduce lung viral loads in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model without ritonavir. Taken together, compound 28f is a promising orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate that deserves further research.",

While α-position disulfide bonds are advantageous for rapid response to redox conditions, they also risk premature drug leakage during circulation. This study introduces a steric hindrance-guided approach to engineer disulfide-bridged podophyllotoxin homodimeric prodrugs for spatiotemporal controlled delivery. By monomethyl or dimethyl substitution of the carbon atoms adjacent to the α-disulfide bond, we can modulate steric hindrance. Excessive hindrance destabilizes the nanoassemblies and slows effective drug release, while moderate hindrance (monomethyl modification) enhances pharmacokinetic properties and promotes selective tumor activation. In vivo studies indicate that monomethyl-modified prodrug nanoassemblies exhibit superior antitumor efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity compared to PPT solution. This work underscores the importance of steric hindrance in optimizing prodrug nanoassembly stability and tumor-specific activation, offering a comprehensive strategy for redox-responsive nanomedicines.",

RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute the largest class of ubiquitin enzymes, providing a scaffold for substrate recognition and catalysis. Their shallow groove recognition interfaces involving discontinuous epitopes and a lack of defined binding pockets have largely rendered them undruggable. Inspired by natural RING inhibitors, we have developed a pharmacophore-based strategy for the rational design of peptidomimetics targeting RING domains, and we demonstrate its feasibility by using the macromolecular APC/C complex (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome). We designed scaffolds binding to the APC/C RING domain and efficiently inhibiting its activity in vitro. Iterative structure-based design and experimental studies to optimize their chemical stability, permeability, and specificity lead to new hydrocarbon-stapled-based molecules inhibiting APC/C in vitro and in cancer cells. Our results provide a robust rationale for targeting RING-containing enzymes of therapeutic value and promising leads for clinical APC/C inhibition.",

However, the reasons for this pharmacokinetic behavior are less explored. Herein, we focused on identifying potential mechanisms for our previously developed heterobivalent (SST2/albumin) [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-cLAB-TATEs. For this purpose, we designed two novel derivatives that show either negligible binding to albumin or lack the SST2-targeting capability. Based on the in vivo results, we hypothesize that binding of the albumin-bound radioligand to SST2 in addition to that of the free radioligand causes the increased tumor uptake. This is supported by saturation binding analyses in the presence of albumin and compartment modeling considerations. Overall, the results of this study provide a first tentative explanation for the phenomenon of increased tumor uptake for albumin-binding radioligands, which may support the prospective design of such radioligands.",

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also known to be significantly influenced by the interfacial charge and mass transfer in a catalyst/H2O biphase system. Herein, for the first time, a highly stable and floating hydrogen‐water cogeneration hybrid hydrogel that utilizes photothermal‐induced interface microenvironment variation to accelerate sluggish photocatalytic water splitting reaction is reported. Supported by solar‐powered interfacial evaporation and efficient vapor generation, the rationally designed hydrogel effectively transforms the conventional liquid‐solid interface into a gas‐solid photocatalytic interface. The presence of gas‐liquid coexistence state offers a disordered and loose hydrogen‐bond network while preserving the proton transfer channel, greatly reducing reaction activation energy and interfacial energy barriers. The improved heat and mass transfer together with optimized charge transfer pathways suppress electron‐hole recombination, the integrated photothermal‐coupled solar photocatalytic hydrogel exhibits excellent operational stability and self‐adaptive rotation in seawater, mitigating salt accumulation and achieving an exceptional vapor generation rate of 4.71 kg m−2 h−1 and a hydrogen‐evolving rate of 1961.25 µmol g−1 h−1 under one sun illumination.",

However, conventional polymeric membranes are constrained by permeability‐selectivity trade‐off and instability under real‐world operating conditions. While covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold promise, their overlarge pores and poor film‐processibility are to be imperatively solved. Herein, a ternary building unit system is designed for synthesizing imine‐based COF nanosheets with programmable interlayer offsets. By synergizing a planar aldehyde monomer as the basic structural unit and a none‐planar alkyl‐functionalized aldehyde monomer as the structure regulation unit, we induce layer distortion that disrupts π–π dominated AA stacking, enabling angstrom‐precise pore tuning (1.4–0.6 nm) via controlled transitions to AB stacking while retaining crystallinity. The mechanically robust nanosheets are easily assembled into large‐area membranes via a facile blade casting, overcoming the processability bottleneck associated with binary building unit systems. The resulting membranes demonstrate an exceptional H2/CO2 selectivity of 60, surpassing existing benchmarks. When treating gas mixtures from methanol steam reforming, a two‐stage membrane process achieves 99.5% H2 purity and 94.0% recovery. Precise modulation of pore architecture and mechanical flexibility through building units engineered stacking affords a platform for microporous organic membranes.",

    "abstract": "Abstractπ‐conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability. Nevertheless, the effective control over their dielectric properties is a challenge. Herein, the charge carrier migration in π‐conjugated MOFs is harnessed to significantly amplify the electromagnetic response, where the strengthened atom coordination can activate a distinctive conductance‐reinforced attenuation mechanism. This results in finely calibrated EMW absorption characteristics, including a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at mere 2 mm, a minimum reflection loss of −46.7 dB at 3.5 mm, and a substantial reduction in radar cross‐section (RCS) up to −23.3 dBm2. Furthermore, the seamless integration of the π‐conjugated MOF hybrids within ultraviolet (UV)‐curable 3D printing technology has enabled the fabrication of a stealth‐enabled drone propeller prototype, which exhibits a remarkably low infrared emissivity of 0.205. Additionally, when the propeller device is subjected to a 100 °C heating platform for 30 min, its surface temperature remains below 50 °C, demonstrating exceptional thermal management and stability under elevated temperature conditions. This work underscores the immense potential of these cutting‐edge absorbers to shape the future of advanced military stealth technologies.",

Here, Cu2‐xS is identified as a promising candidate to overcome this limitation due to its hierarchical phase transitions. Using in situ biasing experiments, reversible and non‐reversible phase transitions (and resistive switching) are demonstrated in γ‐Cu2S by controlling the compliance current. The formation of parallel high‐digenite Cu1.8S channels, orientated along the γ‐Cu2S [201] crystallographic direction, drives the nonvolatile resistive switching. These channels emerge via an intermediate δ‐Cu2S phase and are stabilized at room temperature by residual strains, alongside β‐Cu2S phase. The work clarifies the complex, electrically triggered phase transformations in γ‐Cu2S, and highlights the potential of Cu2‐xS as a versatile material for neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising thermoelectric cooling candidate, exhibiting room‐temperature performance comparable to that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). However, the Seebeck coefficient of p‐type SnSe crystals remains significantly lower than that of n‐type Bi₂(Te, Se)₃ (BTS), and the resulting mismatches hinder effective utilization of its excellent cooling potential. To address this limitation, resonant levels are introduced in the valence bands of hole‐doped SnSe through indium‐doping, which increased the density of states and thereby boosted the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy enable the power factor to reach ≈55 µWcm−1K−2 and ZT value of ≈1.0 at 300 K, with a more matching Seebeck coefficient of ≈211 µVK−1. Furthermore, a full‐scale thermoelectric cooler incorporating the p‐type SnSe paired with n‐type BTS demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference (ΔTmax) of ≈81.1 K at 343 K. A SnSe‐based single‐leg device achieve a conversion efficiency of ≈7.0% under a ΔT of 250 K. These findings highlight that matching thermoelectric parameter of p‐type and n‐type materials is crucial for enhancing the cooling efficiency of devices, and engineering resonant energy levels constitutes a robust strategy for solving the inherent performance limitations of p‐type SnSe in practical thermoelectric applications.",

Here, a 3D structure smaller is developed than a single cell, that a Self‐Adhesion‐Tunnel (SAT) is called, that causes cells to wrap around it and bind to themselves. This process is driven through the cadherin proteins that regulate cell‐cell adhesion, and it is shown that many of the key elements of a normal cell‐cell adhesion are found in self‐adhesions. Size and shape of the SAT determine the efficiency of self‐adhesion formation, and >90% efficient formation of self‐adhesions are observed in both kidney and skin cells per SAT. Self‐adhesions can persist for at least 24 hrs and act to stabilize the cell‐material interface and reduce migration.

    "abstract": "AbstractIon transport in environments with mixed ions is crucial for numerous real‐world applications. However, most membranes suffer from reduced selectivity in the mixed ion environment. Herein, the concept of dual‐nanoconfined channels in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated for superior mixed mono‐/multivalent ion separation. By incorporating acidic functionalities into the pore wall and coupling with a suitable pore size in the COF membranes, multivalent ions interact strongly with the acidic groups. This shields the interactions of the wall with monovalent ions, leaves sufficient space for fast monovalent ion passage, and in the meantime blocks multivalent ions, creating well‐defined dual‐nanoconfinement for mixed ion separation. Consequently, mixed Li+/Mg2+ ion selectivity exceeding 1,300 and mono‐/trivalent ion selectivity over 9,000 is achieved. Molecular dynamics simulation and experiment with multiple ion pairs further confirm the mechanisms. The study sheds light on a fundamentally new design principle for mixed ion separation, offering the potential to reach remarkable selectivity in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNeural networks are found to play an important role in monitoring and coordinating cardiac physiological activities. However, the clinical use of neuroregulatory strategies for repairing infarcted myocardium, such as vagus nerve stimulation and pharmacological activation, confronts the challenges of managing stimulation signals and potential drug side effects. In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a “pre‐neuralized” scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. Strontium silicate promotes NSCs differentiation, resulting in a scaffold enriched with mature neurons. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that enhance the maturation and synchronized contraction of cardiomyocytes, facilitating myocardial repair and improving cardiac function in vivo. The findings indicate that the pre‐neuralized scaffold aids myocardial recovery by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural‐induced regulation in tissue repair. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to repairing infarcted myocardium using inorganic biomaterial‐induced scaffolds with neuromodulatory properties from the perspective of systemically physiological regulation. This work may offer a new perspective for addressing complex tissue and organ injuries.",

However, LRO exhibits large voltage hysteresis and rapid voltage decay with irreversible TM migration upon prolonged cycling. Given that high‐entropy oxides have expanded the potential for retarding the harmful phase transition and regulating the site energies, therefore a high‐entropy Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.12Co0.12Mg0.03Cu0.02Ti0.02Nb0.02O2 cathode is synthesized (HELRO) for LIBs in the present study, demonstrated significantly improved voltage retention and energy output. In addition, this work unveils the sluggish degradation of superlattice and local structure in HELRO during long charge–discharge cycles and explains the “migration retardation effect.” The higher configurational entropy contributes to the higher energy barriers for in‐plane, out‐of‐plane, and continuous Mn migrations due to the synergistic ionic–covalent enhancement of Mn─O bonds. This work provides new insights for understanding the improvement mechanisms of high entropy cathodes and demonstrates the feasibility of suppressing long‐standing voltage decay by high entropy design combining covalent and ionic elements.",

    "abstract": "AbstractQuantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QLEDs) usually exhibit a positive aging phenomenon with their efficiency and brightness increase after storage for several days. Although positive aging enhances device performance, its random and uncontrollable process presents substantial challenges for QLED industrialization. Here, It is identified that the H2O, produced by the reaction between the acidic resin and ZnMgO, can slowly passivate the defects of ZnMgO and is thus responsible for the positive aging. By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post‐annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. As a result, the fresh devices exhibit a high efficiency of 55.2 lm W−1 (26%), which is 2.04 (1.67)‐fold higher than those of untreated devices and 1.21 (1.02)‐fold higher than those of untreated devices after positive aging. Moreover, the performance of the treated devices remains very stable even after storage for several days, indicating the undesired positive aging is completely eliminated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, can promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.",

However, the rapid crystallization of Sn‐Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual‐anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high‐quality MA‐free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent‐free spin‐coating process. Acetate anions (Ac−) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac− and thiocyanate anions (SCN−) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual‐anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non‐radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single‐junction Sn‐Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn‐Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent.

The results suggest that the solid‐solution strategy can effectively modulate the energy position of the valence band and the charge density distributions of the lowest unoccupied band, as well as the interfacial triboelectrification. Consequently, the ML performance of the composite elastomer in terms of intensity, spectral characteristic, and repeatability has been significantly improved. Particularly, the optimum CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer exhibits stable and repeatable ML for over 20 000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions.

For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long‐circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein‐resistant yet cell membrane‐binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell‐membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N‐alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N‐alkyl chain became cell membrane‐philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)‐loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple‐negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor‐active drug delivery carriers.",

Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and  transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon‐conducting ceramics offer a low‐density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4 W m−1 K−1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi‐generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low‐loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m−1 K−1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post‐processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly‐lactic acid  matrix from surface‐modified boron nitride platelets, creating a “hetero‐percolated network”. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.",

Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono‐disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra‐dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room‐temperature structural transformation‐induced in situ core‐shell self‐assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre‐core‐shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit >80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential >80 mV) even after >10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single‐photon emission with g(2)(0) M is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.",

Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of π‐conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub‐graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon‐like large π‐conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen‐free edge C(sp2)–H sites, and well‐defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g−1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g−1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials. These findings provide a fundamental design strategy for carbon‐based cathodes in LICs that highlighting the role of π‐conjugation and edge chemistry in electrochemical performance, paving the way for next‐generation high‐capacity, high‐voltage energy storage devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid‐state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)‐vacancies (O‐LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐based CPEs (PEO@O‐LZO). The O‐LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O‐vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O‐vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O‐LZO at 40 °C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O‐LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40 °C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid‐state lithium metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non‐invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off‐target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic‐based Calibrated 5‐ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non‐pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5‐ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia‐inducible promoter regulating O‐acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post‐treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor‐specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5‐ALA‐based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor‐targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConcrete, the world's second most utilized material after water, is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse emissions. Current carbon capturing and storage (CCS) concrete often involves convoluted processes, slow kinetics, limited CO2 uptake, non‐uniform carbonation in structures, and high cost. Efforts to enhance carbon sequestration often rely on increasing porosities, which compromise the mechanical strength of the resulting concrete. The 3D printing of CCS concrete is reported by incorporating diatomaceous earth (DE), a highly accessible biomineral with hierarchical porosity, into triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures. DE enables stable extrusion, high print fidelity, and reduced density, which are crucial for 3D concrete printing. Further, DE facilitates CaCO3 nucleation within the concrete and mitigates carbonation resistance, achieving a maximum CO2 absorption of 488.7 gCO2 per kg cement in 7 days, a 142% increase over conventional concrete. Optimizing TPMS geometry further enhances carbonation efficiency by enabling uniform CO2 uptake throughout the structure. This geometry refinement reduces material usage by 78% and increases the surface‐area‐to‐volume ratio by 515%, leading to a 30% higher CO2 uptake while preserving mechanical integrity. The material strategy, together with the optimized concrete printing of TPMS structures, offers a pathway toward scalable and sustainable solutions without undermining concrete's structural functions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSpinel LiMn2O4 is a promising cathode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to its nontoxicity, resource abundance, substantial operating voltage, and remarkable thermal stability. Nevertheless, LiMn2O4 is subjected to subpar electronic/ion conductivity and continuous capacity attenuation triggered by the Jahn‐Teller distortion. In this regard, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential morphological controllers that impact particle size and crystal orientation and offer vacancy‐accepting layers that facilitate oxygen defect formation, which boost electron/ion diffusion when utilized as self‐sacrificial templates. The dissatisfying capacity retention caused by Mn2+ dissolution related to the Mn3+ disproportion is another tricky issue, which requires resolution through surface modification. To attain these goals, this work develops a strategy intermarrying the merits of oxygen defects and Zn‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework‐62 (Zn‐ZIF‐62) glass shields. Mn‐MOFs with carboxyl‐based ligands possessing various coordination numbers are adopted as precursors to optimize the morphological feature and modulate the oxygen vacancy level. Computational and experimental results examine the efficaciousness of oxygen defects in ameliorating the electrochemical activity and expediting electron/ion transportation. Synchronously, the ZIF‐62 glass layer inhibits manganese loss and phase degradation toward prolonged cycling durability in LIB half/full cells. This study envisions a versatile methodology to modify spinel LiMn2O4 as a longevous cathode for next‐generation LIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractStructured catalysts, characterized by continuous, highly porous architectures, have long been recognized for their ability to enhance thermal stability, mechanical robustness, and operational efficiency in catalytic processes. Nevertheless, the use of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their exceptional atomic efficiency, in structured, shaped, or printed forms remains an emerging challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in maintaining atomic dispersion and ensuring stability under processing and reaction conditions. This review explores recent developments in the design and use of structured single‐atom catalysts (collectively referred to as stru‐SACs herein), focusing on their unique properties and the potential benefits of combining the atomic precision of SACs with engineered architectures. The composition of structured supports, ranging from traditional materials, such as ceramics and metals, to advanced materials, such as graphene, carbon, and aerogels, are examined. Additionally, functional active sites, innovative fabrication strategies, and advanced characterization techniques required to probe the atomic‐scale environments of stru‐SACs are discussed. The applications of stru‐SACs are reviewed across thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis, with an emphasis on how the electronic and structural characteristics of these materials enhance the catalytic performance. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives of stru‐SACs are outlined.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on electrode materials remains a critical challenge in the development of alkali metal‐ion batteries, with its complex formation mechanism and diverse composition significantly impacting practical performance. Herein a theory‐guided prediction approach is presented to construct a rigid–soft coupling SEI, engineered through the strategic regulation of both interfacial and bulk electrochemistry for the design of nitrogen‐ and boron‐coordinated cobalt single atoms within nitrogen‐doped carbon (Co–N₃B/C) anodes. The experimental and theoretical findings reveal that the distinctive Co–N3B configuration tends to generate a local electric field that benefits for fast Na+ transfer kinetics and the decomposition of fluorinated electrolyte, resulting in the formation of a robust inorganic‐rich SEI. Consequently, the dual‐coordinated Co single‐atom electrode design, coupled with the hybrid organic–inorganic SEI, endows the sodium‐ion batteries anode with a high capacity of 230.5 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and exceptional long‐term cycling stability, as evidenced by 97.0% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1. This study not only demonstrates the significant advantages of single‐atom catalysis in controlling SEI formation and electrolyte degradation but also paves the way for using this technology to enhance the performance of carbon‐based anodes in a wide range of metal‐ion batteries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the growing scarcity of worldwide energy and freshwater resources, utilizing abundant seawater for hydrogen production via electrolysis has become imperative. However, due to the multi‐electron intermediate process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the competition reaction/erosion from Cl−, the design of highly selective and corrosion‐resistant seawater electrocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, Ce‐decorated NiFe LDH nanosheets array anchored on vertically aligned CuO nanowire (CeNiFe@CuO) is fabricated by one‐step electrodeposition strategy, where Ce doping increases the Lewis acidity and crystal imperfection degree of the composite. The CeNiFe@CuO can achieve high current density of 500 mA cm−2 with overpotential of 265 and 280 mV in KOH and alkaline natural seawater, respectively, and remain stable for 300 h at 500 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater without apparent corrosion. Systematic experiments and mechanism analysis confirm that the excellent OER activity can be attributed to the introduction of Ce species, which bring massive oxygen vacancies and accelerate the Ni component oxidation rate. Moreover, the CeNiFe@CuO exhibits enhanced surface OH− adsorption kinetics and capacity, resulting in electrostatic exclusion of Cl− to achieve high OER stability and selectivity. This study provides new insights into the development of efficient corrosion‐resistant electrocatalysts for high‐current seawater electrolysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProbabilistic computing, with its efficient and non‐deterministic computational model, holds great potential and is driving a paradigm shift in computation. However, traditional CMOS circuits face issues such as a high device count, significant energy consumption, and pseudo‐random behavior. Additionally, commonly used probabilistic computing devices like LBNM and sMTJ suffer from problems related to volatility and initialization. This paper explores the application of non‐volatile combined bit (c‐bit) devices, exhibiting back‐hopping‐like phenomena, in logical operations, arithmetic computations, and data backup and recovery. Logical reverse inferences are successfully implemented for AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR operations. Importantly, the logical reverse inference of full and half adders is achieved, as well as the decomposition of addends, verifying the feasibility of c‐bit devices in complex arithmetic operations. Furthermore, by utilizing multiple c‐bit devices working in tandem, efficient data backup and reliable recovery are achieved, offering a novel solution for data security. This research not only enriches the theoretical framework of probabilistic computing but also provides new insights and directions for the future development of computational models.",

However, interface instability hinders their further development. Herein, an in situ polymerized electrolyte is developed incorporating a liquid metal alloy (LM) that simultaneously achieves high ionic conductivity and self‐healing interfacial stability. This in situ polymerized electrolyte achieves a remarkable ionic conductivity of 2.7 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Additionally, the electrolyte demonstrates self‐healing capabilities because of the special electric field‐induced motion and liquid fluidity of the LM.

    "abstract": "AbstractLi‐rich layered oxide cathodes (LLOs) with anionic redox are promising to boost the energy density of lithium batteries beyond 500 Wh kg−1. However, their commercialization has long been hampered by inherent drawbacks, particularly voltage decay and hysteresis, which reduce energy density and efficiency, shorten battery life, and challenge battery management. To address these issues, a prerequisite is establishing a comprehensive understanding of voltage‐related phenomena correlated with anionic redox reactions (ARR), which remains elusive despite extensive research. Therefore, in this review, the proposed mechanisms are systematically summarized and the fundamental origins of voltage decay and hysteresis are identified, together with elucidating their relationship with ARR. Voltage decay is mainly attributed to irreversible TM migration and phase transition, whose driving force involves factors like lattice strain accumulation and oxygen loss. A relatively unified theory, the asymmetric non‐equilibrium reaction path during ARR, is identified as the fundamental origin of voltage hysteresis. This path includes sequential electrochemical reactions and chemical processes (sluggish electronic and atomic structural rearrangements, such as TM migration and ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer). Recent achievements and effective solutions for these voltage issues are also elaborated. After deeply understanding voltage decay and hysteresis, inspiring insights for mitigation strategies and forward‐looking remarks are provided.",

The continuously growing demand for urea has spurred an escalation in production. Considering the impacts of byproducts during urea production, it is urgent to explore cost‐effective and environmentally benign urea synthesis methods. Artificial photosynthesis, which utilizes renewable solar power to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2), not only provides a sustainable alternative for urea synthesis but also reduces carbon emissions and fixes nitrogen simultaneously. This review delves into the C−N coupling pathways, key intermediates, and their detection methodologies in photocatalytic urea production. It also discusses the rational design and selection of targeted photocatalysts toward urea synthesis, highlighting their key characteristics that determine the rate‐limiting steps. Furthermore, it systematically examines the challenges in photocatalytic urea synthesis and evaluates viable solutions to overcome these limitations. By identifying current obstacles and proposing potential strategies, this review aims to advance artificial photosynthesis as a sustainable and eco‐friendly approach for urea production.

    "abstract": "AbstractLow‐hysteresis merits in polymeric gel materials can significantly enhance their operational reliability and service lifetime in emerging applications such as smart wearable devices. However, fabricating gel materials with low hysteresis and high toughness remains challenging due to their intrinsic contradictory attributes, particularly in ionic liquid (IL)‐based systems. Herein, a water‐mediated polymer network reorganization strategy is presented for developing tough and low hysteresis ionohydrogels (IHGs) containing ILs, where the synergistic effect between covalent crosslinking and dynamic interfacial lubrication governs their exceptional performance. Water can act as a lubricating mediator to moderately attenuate interactions between ILs and polymer chains, thereby enabling the formation of dynamically adaptive networks that facilitate chain mobility and stress redistribution. Therefore, the IHGs fabricated through water content modulation achieve a well‐balanced combination of high toughness (2.2 MJ m−3) and low hysteresis (8.1% at 400% strain). Meanwhile, the prepared IHGs demonstrate superior comprehensive performance, including high stretchability, excellent tensile strength, superior electrical conductivity, good biocompatibility, and transparency. Finally, the IHGs can function as high‐performance wearable sensors and biocompatible epidermal electrodes, enabling real‐time health monitoring and acquisition of high‐fidelity electrophysiological signals. The simple strategy overcomes the traditional trade‐offs of low hysteresis and high toughness, demonstrating exceptional potential in real‐life scenarios.",

However, how to efficiently generate 1O2 by modulating the asymmetric structure and electron spin state of catalyst remains a challenge. Herein, an asymmetric Fe─S─Co structured catalyst (Co‐Fe3S4) is designed by in situ substitution of FeIIITd strategy. The strong interaction in the asymmetric structure induces a low‐spin state (e: ↑↓, ↑↓, t2: ↑↓, _, _) at d‐orbital of Co sites, shifting the d‐band center closer to the Fermi level and elevating the antibonding states, which is beneficial for the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The catalyst accelerates 1O2 generation by PMS activation, achieving 100% removal of acetaminophen in pharmaceutical wastewater in 8 min with a high K‐value of 112 min⁻¹ M⁻¹. Experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the spin state of the generated *O2 (from the S─O bond cleavage in HSO5−) is reduced by electron reversal (↓ to ↑) or pairing (↑, ↑ to ↑↓, _) in the 2p (2px and 2py) orbitals of the O─O anti‐π bond (π*), resulting in the 1O2 generation.

Periodic atomic structure in the 1T‐phase MoS2 is constructed to enhance symmetrical electric field distribution and those phase interlaced regions promoted a significant increase in dielectric relaxation. Benefiting the boosted dielectric ability and polarization behaviors, 1T‐phase dominated MoS2@MWCNTs (TMC) exhibit superior EM wave energy dissipation with the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value of −74.3 dB at only 1.7 mm thickness.

Nevertheless, Mn‐based RFBs face a critical challenge: the undesired formation of crystalline MnO2 through Mn3+ disproportionation and irreversibility of MnO2 deposits on electrode surfaces severely diminish accessible reaction sites and restrict achievable areal capacity. Herein, it is demonstrated that ligand chelation‐mediated structural transformation of MnO2 by sodium diphosphate (Na4P2O7, PPi) modulates MnO2 deposition behavior. The PPi coordinate with Mn2+ to form a stable [Mn(HPO4)2(H2O)2]2− chelate, which facilitates the incorporation of defective O and P into the evolving MnO2 structure, effectively disrupting its crystallographic ordering and converting MnO2 from crystalline to amorphous configuration. The amorphous MnO2 tends to flow into the electrolyte instead of depositing on the electrode due to the electrostatic interplay, thereby resulting in a breakthrough areal capacity of 91.5 mAh cm−2 (300 cycles @ 99.7% CE) and 141.8 mAh cm−2 (150 cycles @ 98.2% CE, the highest reported values), representing a 10‐fold enhancement compared to additive‐free counterparts.

Nevertheless, owing to the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), the efficacy of single‐agent immunotherapy remains limited. Herein, CSZ@Gel is designed by co‐loading cyclic diguanosine (CDG) and siXkr8 in zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) nanoparticles and subsequently integrating them into α‐tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) hydrogels. ZIF‐8 is found to undergo degradation under acidic conditions releasing its cargo and Zn2+ to induce cell pyroptosis. CDG triggers the activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines release, dendritic cell (DC) maturation and CD8+ T cell infiltration. siXkr8 inhibits the expression of scramblase mXkr8 and decreases the phosphatidylserine translocation to the cell surface, thus decreasing immature DCs and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reversing TIME. In a murine CRC model, CSZ@Gel exhibits significant tumor growth suppression effects, extends the median survival time of mice to more than 60 days, and significantly inhibits CRC recurrence after resection by long‐term synergistic anti‐tumor immune activation. These findings suggest that CSZ@Gel provides an innovative drug delivery platform with clinical translation potential through comprehensive strategies for sustained CRC immunotherapy.",

However, when arranged in large‐scale arrays, their performance is often hindered by challenges such as poor reliability and sneak currents. To address these, Al, N‐doped TaOx (ANTO) memristors are precisely engineered in this study using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The oxygen vacancy (Vo) content in TaOx can be regulated by controlling the dopant concentrations via the number of ALD cycles, thereby effectively adjusting the Schottky barrier height and surface resistance. This optimizes the oxygen ion‐based interface‐type resistive switching while improving the self‐rectifying properties. Furthermore, Vo passivation by N‐doping effectively suppresses sneak currents in crossbar arrays. Optimized devices exhibit endurance exceeding 3.5 × 104 cycles and 3‐bit retention over 103 s. Their long‐term potentiation and depression characteristics are highly accurate in synaptic neural network‐based image recognition tasks. Hardware‐level demonstrations using the fabricated 32 × 32 crossbar array confirm stable analog switching, reliable multibit programming, and effective suppression of sneak‐path currents under practical operating conditions. Notably, selective multilevel programming is validated through conductance mapping, demonstrated by visualizing a word pattern within the crossbar array.

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study employs an “electron island” micro‐interface engineering strategy to construct a NiCoP/Mo4P3 heterostructured catalytic system on a FeP substrate via a synergistic hydrothermal synthesis and low‐temperature phosphorization approach. The unique open hierarchical architecture provides atomic‐scale anchoring sites for small‐sized Mo4P3 quantum dots (QDs), forming a high‐density “electron island‐substrate” micro‐interface network, which drastically increases the population of active micro‐interface sites between the two phases. Concurrently, the discretely distributed QDs induce interfacial charge polarization through quantum confinement effects, generating a robust built‐in electric field at the heterointerfaces that drives directional electron migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows the interfacial interaction between NiCoP and Mo4P3 can effectively manipulate the electronic architecture and regulate the H* adsorption energy, further decreasing the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*). FeP@NiCoP/Mo4P3 can make full use of the active sites generated at the interface, to give full play to the catalytic properties of heterogeneous structures, which ensures the significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic efficiency and excellent long‐term stability in alkaline water and complicated seawater environments. This work provides guidance and direction to maximize the interface effect for designing efficient and stable catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractShort‐chain sulfur species with high redox activity have significant applied implications as electrode materials for Na/K‐ion batteries. However, the synthesis of short‐chain sulfur composites that simultaneously feature high sulfur content and high conductivity remains a significant challenge. Herein, the facile fabrication of conductive short‐chain sulfur composite with ultra‐high sulfur content (42.5 wt%) for efficient Na/K‐ion storage is reported. The protocol relied only on the industrial pitch and elemental sulfur as precursor via a simple heat treatment at low temperature (e.g. 450 °C). Rich delocalized C═C and C═S bonds are introduced into the carbon skeleton, forming the spatial π‐electron conjugation and spatial sp2‐hybridization, and resulting in a six‐order‐of‐magnitude enhancement of the electronic conductivity compared to the pitch‐derive carbon. The short‐chain sulfur species demonstrate superb reactivity with both Na‐ion and K‐ion without dissoluble polysulfide formation. A surface‐dominated storage mechanism enables outstanding electrode kinetics with diminished electrode deformation. As anodes, this composite delivers extraordinary reversible capacities for both Na‐ion (848 mAh g−1) and K‐ion (699 mAh g−1) storage with superior rate and promising cyclability. Moreover, this anode could even deliver impressive battery performances for K‐ion storage at a high mass loading (10.2 mg cm−2) of the active composite.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectronic skin (E‐skin) that emulates the human skin's three basic functions (perception, protection, and thermoregulation) has broad applied potential in smart healthcare and human‐machine interaction (HMI). To fully realize the integration functions and simulate the structure of real skin, this work reactivates the “dead leather” back to intelligent E‐skin (Leather/Ag/Polyborosiloxane elastomer) and further develops its application in harsh scenarios. The Ag nanowires/flakes incorporated leather fiber acts as the dermis layer to endow the E‐skin with good electric conductivity, force sensitivity, and electrothermal management. The hierarchical structure allows the incident electromagnetic waves to be reflected and absorbed multiple times, possessing a superior electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding value (≈75 dB). Due to the unique rate‐dependent shear stiffening effects originated from the polyborosiloxane elastomer, the E‐skin achieves significant force buffering capacity (≈47%) and excellent energy dissipation (over 85%). Moreover, the LAP E‐skin exhibits unconventional sensing behavior, including piezoresistive sensing and impact stimulation, allowing for differentiation between low‐energy and high‐energy stimuli. On this basis, an elegant smart vest is successfully developed with exceptional thermal therapy, accurate contact perception, and wireless impact monitoring, demonstrating broad potential in the next generation of wearable protective equipment and smart robotics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe recently discovered long‐range topological spin textures exhibit spontaneous Hall effects, which offer a breakthrough solution to the challenge of write‐in and readout of spin information in antiferromagnets. Despite this advancement, the implementation of such long‐range magnetic orders in single‐crystal nanoflakes remains limited, which can otherwise enhance the design flexibility of heterostructures and open new possibilities for next‐generation ultracompact, high‐speed, and low‐power spintronic devices. Here, air‐stable intercalated Co1/3TaS2 single‐crystal nanoflakes are reported, demonstrating two magnetic phase transitions and a potential charge density wave phase transition. Transport measurements confirmed the persistence of non‐coplanar antiferromagnetic order in exfoliated Co1/3TaS2 nanoflakes, characterized by a spontaneous topological Hall effect with rectangular shape and moderate coercive fields. The underlying mechanisms of the two magnetic phase transitions, as well as the anomalous Hall effect resulting from skew scattering observed above the Néel temperature, are investigated. Furthermore, the successful integration of Co1/3TaS2 nanoflake into van der Waals heterostructure underscores the potential for diverse device applications. This study enhances the understanding of non‐coplanar antiferromagnetic order and advances the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIt remains challenging to synthesize effective and photocorrosion‐tolerated organic photocatalysts for two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e⁻ ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e⁻ WOR). Herein, two isomeric Zn‐Salen metal covalent organic frameworks (Zn‐Salen‐MCOFs) with kgd‐v or hcb topology are designed as robust and efficient photocatalysts for dual‐channel H2O2 photosynthesis. Zn‐Salen‐MCOF with kgd‐v topology shows a higher H2O2 photocatalytic production rate of 6617/3438 µmol gcat.−1 h−1 in pure water with/without additional O2 or air saturation, together with long‐time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance (100 h). The framework isomerism effect and the chelated linkages contribute to the improved H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency and stability of it. A three‐step 2e⁻ WOR with the initial H2O adsorption over the ZnO2N2 unit and a four‐step 2e⁻ ORR reaction mechanism with the key Had adsorption at the pyrazinic N site are proposed. This study paves the way for developing robust MCOF‐based photocatalysts for dual‐channel H2O2 production based on chelated linkage and framework isomerism effect.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the use of 2‐(carboxyethyl) (dimethyl)sulfonium bromide (CDMSBr), a carboxyl‐functionalized derivative of trimethylsulfonium (TMS+), as an additive in ternary cation, (Cs0.05FA0.90MA0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 [CsFAMA]), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to enhance both stability and photovoltaic performance. In solution, it exhibits a zwitterionic form that controls nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. It further protonates into CDMS+ during crystallization to facilitate the formation of larger and more uniform grains with better crystallinity. Optimized CsFAMA‐based device achieves power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.02% (enhancement of 6.54%) at 1‐sun condition and 38.79% (enhancement of 9.21%) under low‐intensity indoor lighting (1000‐lx, LED 5000 K). The dual role of the additive in defect passivation and grain size enhancement contributes to reduced trap density, promoting increased stability of the PSCs. Devices with CDMSBr maintain 88.53% of their initial PCE after 960 h in ambient conditions. These findings highlight the potential of carboxyl‐functionalized sulfonium additives, like CDMSBr, to enhance perovskite morphology and stability, advancing the performance and operational durability of PSCs.",

This review article presents a complete examination of current progress in HE‐MOFs and their derived materials for diverse catalytic reactions, including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and thermal catalysis. Various strategies for boosting the catalytic reactivity of HE‐MOFs and their derived materials have been discussed, including pore architecture modulation, morphological control, defect engineering, elemental composition tuning, and interface optimization. A thorough investigation has been conducted on various catalytic reactions like water splitting, oxygen reduction, nitrogen reduction, alcohol oxidation, hydrogenation, and cycloaddition. Furthermore, the underlying structure–property correlation governing their activity has been discussed, and key challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field have been highlighted. The insights presented in this review aim to guide the rational design of next‐generation high‐entropy materials for sustainable and efficient catalytic processes.",

Despite such interest, acceptable results were obtained only by modifying the norbornadiene‐quadricyclane (NBD‐QC) system, still leaving key issues unsolved. Here, we have designed a full storage‐release MOST cycle based on the Paternò‐Büchi reaction, potentially offering a class of compounds with a significantly higher storage density than NBD‐QC. Based on the experimental evidence concerning the viability of their synthesis and photoreactivity, we have repurposed those compounds by computationally elucidating the substitution pattern effects on low‐energy isomer’s light absorption, followed by high‐energy isomer’s photoproduction, including singlet and triplet states involved by the Paternò‐Büchi type of reactivity. The thermal conversion back to the initial isomer to release the stored energy was also studied, including a sustainable option by taking advantage of enzymatic activity.",

Nevertheless, the direct formation of C3 products encounters significant limitations due to the C2–C1 coupling reaction, posing a considerable challenge to improving their faradaic efficiency. Here, we present a design for an elevated pressure cascade catalytic reactor to convert CO2 to C3 products in a two‐step electrochemical process. At 25 bar pressure, by regulating the potential of the cascade system and the electrolyte flow rate we report a 40% selectivity for 2‐propanol on a copper electrode placed upstream of a silver electrode that converts CO2 to CO. In cascade mode (with both silver and copper electrodes active), the C3:C2 oxygenate ratio significantly increases to 7 compared to the non‐cascade mode (copper only) with a modest ratio of about 0.6. Thereby, our elevated pressure cascade electrolysis approach demonstrates a notable step forward in CO2 electroreduction to oxygenated C3 products.",

    "abstract": "Cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX₃, X=I, Br or their mixture) have emerged as a type of promising photovoltaic material due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, thermal stability and low cost. Despite the great progress achieved in the corresponding photovoltaic devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags far behind their theoretical limit. Comparing with the obtained high current density and fill factor, it is of great potential for increasing the open‐circuit voltage (Voc) value as the Voc loss of the CsPbX3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still quite significant considering their wide bandgap. The primary mechanisms of Voc loss involve non‐radiative recombination driven by bulk defects, interfacial defects and energy level mismatching. To address the above issues, numerous strategies have been investigated including additive engineering, interface modification, charge transport layer replacement, etc. Herein, this review summarizes the most recent work on mitigating Voc loss of CsPbX3 PSCs from three aspects, namely bulk film optimization, interface regulation and transport layer optimization, and gives a brief outlook on how to promote the Voc further. With this, a guideline is provided for researchers engaging in developing CsPbX3 PSCs with high photovoltaic performance.",

This work presents a one‐pot two‐step linear sequence for the efficient deracemization of β‐chlorohydrins by combining a photocatalytic alcohol oxidation with a stereoselective carbonyl bioreduction using alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Despite the thermodynamic challenges of the oxidation step for this family of substrates, three efficient photochemical conditions under white light irradiation were found using catalytic 2,4,6‐triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPPT) or 2,3‐dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ) in this case in stoichiometric or by in situ regeneration of the catalyst. In addition, its sunlight‐driven applicability and its implementation in flow chemistry were demonstrated. After testing the scope of these methodologies, 2‐chloro‐1‐arylethanols were found as suitable substrates. For those β‐halohydrins oxidized with complete conversion, the deracemization strategy was successfully achieved yielding twelve enantiopure (R)‐ and (S)‐β‐halohydrins. Furthermore, 2‐chloro‐1‐phenylethanol enantiomers were subjected to an additional chemical cyclization under basic conditions, providing both (R)‐ and (S)‐styrene oxide in a three‐step one‐pot process and without loss of the optical activity.",

However, conventional synthesis routes are limited in scale. Therefore, a novel spray‐drying method is presented herein, enabling a scalable synthesis of LMO sorbents for Li extraction. The ion‐exchange material is studied in both synthetic LiCl solutions and two different geothermal brines from the Upper Rhine Valley, demonstrating improved Li selectivity and extraction capabilities compared to materials from hydrothermal synthesis approaches. The extraction behavior in relevant mildly acidic environments is studied in detail. Further material improvements are achieved by substituting a fraction of Mn by Ti, which greatly reduced the dissolution of manganese during acid treatment in the first 5 extraction cycles from 5.6% to only 1.8%. In addition, the maximum sorption capacity of the Ti‐substituted LMO (LMTO) can be further increased from 5.05 mmol g for LMO (35.1 mg g) to 5.66 mmol g for LMTO (39.3 mg g) under optimized m/V ratios. Hence, the results reported herein present a pathway toward LMO‐based ion‐exchange materials for the direct lithium extraction on an industrial scale.",

This study introduces an emulsifier composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and partially cation‐substituted hyaluronate (CHA), both of which are derived from abundant and cost‐effective natural polysaccharides. The synergistic interplay of electrostatic interactions and controlled molecular entanglement between these macromolecules significantly enhances the stability and ripening resistance of the water‐in‐oil emulsion. This optimized formulation demonstrates remarkable longevity, maintaining emulsion integrity for over 365 days while exhibiting exceptional salt tolerance and pH stability across various environmental conditions. Additionally, this entangled polysaccharide‐based Pickering emulsion demonstrated strong adhesion to leaf surfaces, resisting the effects of strong winds and the water‐repellent properties of the lotus leaves. These characteristics associated with microbial compatibility suggest that emulsifiers based on CNCs and CHA provide safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants, especially pertinent to the agrochemical sector.",

However, the high reaction barrier for CH bond breaking and uphill overall reaction lead to the slow kinetics of DMF coupling. Here, we reveal that [HSO4−] and water can collaboratively promote the rate‐limiting step of the CH bond breaking on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 catalyst. An in‐depth study suggests that water mediates hole transfer to the CH bond while [HSO4−] facilitates electron extraction, thus promoting electron and proton transfer on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 surface. Consequently, photocatalytic DMF coupling over Ru‐ZnIn2S4 produces diesel fuel precursors (DFPs) and H2 with benchmarking formation rates of 1.5 g gcatal.−1 h−1 and 9.7 mmol gcatal.−1 h−1, respectively. Moreover, the selectivity of branched‐chain DFPs reaches 55%. This work puts forward new insight and strategy for photocatalytic CC coupling for the synthesis of biofuels.",

Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is one of these technologies in which catalysts play an essential role. In this work, the impact of impurities in catalysts on the output of RCF is investigated. It is found that the yield of phenolic monomers is almost not influenced by the residual chloride (Cl) ions in the commercially available Ru/C catalyst. However, the presence of Cl ions in the catalyst facilitated hemicellulose removal and delignification. Moreover, the enzymatic conversion rate of cellulose in the solid residue increases after RCF, attributed to the enhanced removal of lignin and hemicellulose in the presence of Cl ions. The impact of Cl ions can be eliminated by removing the Cl ions in the catalyst. This work provides an engineering perspective for upscaling RCF technology using large‐scale synthesized catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Developing a selective lignin depolymerization process remains a daunting challenge due to lignin's inherent structural heterogeneity and chemical complexity. This study used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction to produce oligomeric lignin with controlled structural characteristics (narrow size distribution, lower molecular weight) and further subjected it to oxidative depolymerization using peracetic acid as an oxidant. Oxidation of lignin resulting from lactic acid/pyrazole and choline chloride/lactic acid extraction produces phenolic acids (Ph‐COOH) and dicarboxylic acid (DCA) as significant products. Our results show that the judicial choice of DES during extraction plays a critical role in determining the lignin chemical structure, which follows different oxidation pathways and results in different product selectivities. The generalization of this concept has been established with two different parent lignins, e.g., Douglas fir (D.fir) and wheat straw (WS). The overall process showed that the novel DES extraction not only provides a sustainable pathway for high‐purity lignin generation but also could be used as a tool to produce high‐value products selectively upon its oxidation, thus improving the overall lignin biorefinery process.",

However, both monomer and polymer syntheses typically require anaerobic and moisture‐free conditions, often employing hazardous reagents and solvents that limit scalability. Herein, efficient, scalable syntheses for poly(ethyl lipoate) and ethyl lipoate that incorporate Green Chemistry principles are disclosed. The synthesis of ethyl lipoate from lipoic acid on a 100‐gram scale (>80% yield) is optimized lowering the E‐factor (2.27) by an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Diphenyl phosphate, a nonhazardous commercial organic acid, is used to synthesize ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethyl lipoate) on a 50‐gram scale from cationic ROP (CROP). The polymerizations proceed under ambient atmosphere in low‐hazard and renewable solvents, and a mild depolymerization strategy to regenerate the monomer is developed. Due to their extreme molar mass, the materials possess unique mechanical and physical properties. Life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted on synthetic and recycling processes shows that the polydisulfide has competitive environmental impacts comparable to several commodity polymers, despite the latter having an efficiency advantage due to economies of scale. These discoveries establish an economical and scalable closed‐loop polymer platform that can be broadly applied to various polydisulfides sourced from 1,2‐dithiolanes such as lipoic acid.",

By exploring methods to convert liquid humins into carbon materials with optimized porous structures and nitrogen doping, we developed Pd/C catalysts with significantly enhanced performance.

It is found that, upon replacing imine linkage with cyanated vinylene, under the irrdation of visible light, the H2O2 production rates (HPR) considerably increases from 2261 μmol h‐1 g‐1 to 7613 μmol h‐1 g‐1 in pure water and O2 atmosphere without the assistance of any sacrificial agent. Even though in air atmosphere, its HPR value still reaches 6339 μmol h‐1 g‐1 with good recyclability. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to the the enhanced polarity through the incoporation of strong polar sulfone or cyano groups in the COF frameworks, which brings about the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, high photocurrent intensity and low charge resistance as well as the increased surface hydrophilicity. The photocatalytic mechanism is studied by means of the theoretical calculations and comparative experiments conducted under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of the various scavengers for electron, hole, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical in the reaction system.",

Research studies are most generally carried out with pure gas streams of CO2, while the available real sources of CO2 are gases coming out from industrial plants and containing a low share of CO2, and a great diversity of impurities including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Here, we show that a molecular catalyst, [Rh(bpy)(Cp*)Cl]Cl (bpy = bipyridine, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), catalyzes CO2RR to formic acid using a quasi flue gas (5‐10% CO2 and 100 ppm NO2 or 50 ppm SO2) with substantial selectivity. This is made possible thanks to the modification of the cathode surface with a positively charged imidazolium layer, which greatly favors CO2RR over competing reactions, proton, NO2 and SO2 reductions. These results highlight the potential of combining molecular catalysis and electrode surface modification for electroreduction of diluted CO2 without prior carbon capture or purification.",

Liquid catalytic fuel cells (LCFCs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to utilize complex biomass fuels directly.

To address the issue, this study proposed a novel LCFC system using the same catalyst, molybdovanadophosphoric heteropolyacid (PMoV), on both the anode and cathode, effectively mitigating catalyst permeation. Under ambient conditions, the PMoV‐LCFC system achieved a maximum power density of 3.39 mW cm−2 using glucose as the fuel, and the system demonstrated stable performance over five days. Notably, cyclic discharge tests using expired bread as fuel further show the system's effectiveness. The total organic carbon degradation rate reached a maximum of 23.36%, and formic acid was the primary intermediate. The PMoV‐LCFC system effectively reduced catalyst crossover and maintained stable electrochemical performance, offering new insights for designing biomass fuel cells and significantly contributing to waste management.",

In this work, we have demonstrated a hydrophobic tetrapodal receptor Se4Me‐PF6, that exhibits iodine adsorption from an aqueous phase via chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction. In the solution phase, NMR studies reveal that Se4Me‐PF6 selectively recognizes iodide (I−) over other anions. On the other hand, in the solid state, selenoimidazolium building units of Se4Me‐PF6 facilitate self‐assembly into a porous 1D supramolecular ChB framework, enabling efficient iodine adsorption. Consequently, Se4Me‐PF6 has propelled the rapid adsorption of iodine, with a high kinetic rate of 2.10 × 10−3 g·mg−1·min−1, while maintaining its effectiveness under competitive environmental conditions, including pH variations and the presence of interfering anions. Mechanistic investigations using XPS, and DFT studies indicate that iodine capture occurs via a combination of ChB interactions and electrostatic forces provided by the selenoimidazolium motifs. Importantly, Se4Me‐PF6 demonstrates its potential as a stationary phase for column‐based iodine removal, highlighting its applicability in real‐world scenarios. Thus, these findings offer a promising approach for developing iodine adsorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which produces propylene and by‐produces hydrogen, attracts considerable attention in the chemical industry. Alkali metals, budget friendly and commonly used as additives to optimize the performance of Pt‐based alloy catalysts, are extensively utilized in the PDH industry. Herein, the structure and catalytic performance of the commercial catalyst (PtK2/θ‐Al2O3) and contrast samples (Pt0.3K0.8/θ‐Al2O3‐N and Pt0.3/θ‐Al2O3) are analyzed. According to the catalytic test, the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 exhibits better catalytic performance, which achieves >95% propylene selectivity and maintaining a high propane yield (>36%) during stability testing. Observations reveal that the initial propylene selectivity of the Pt‐based catalysts is inversely correlated with the total acidity and strong acid site content. The introducing of K element significantly reduces the acidity of the catalyst and enhances the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the presence of Cl−, co‐introduced with K, improves the catalytic stability, while the slight increase in the acidity of catalysts decreases the propylene selectivity. The enrichment of the electron density of PtK2 nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggest that lower propylene adsorption energy and higher barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation reaction on the PtK2‐(100) surface enhance the propylene selectivity of the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 catalyst.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the development of suitable cocatalysts represents an effective strategy. Cocatalysts can interact with photocatalysts to improve light absorption capabilities and facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, they provide highly active surface sites that promote the adsorption and activation of CO2, which leads to acceleration of photocatalytic reduction. Herein, WO3 is employed as a cocatalyst to promote the CO2 photoreduction performance of a g-C3N4-TiO2 heterojunction through a facile and scalable calcination method. In pure water, optimal WO3/g-C3N4-TiO2 (WCT) delivers high selectivity CO and CH4 formation of 48.31 µmol·g−1 and 77.18 µmol·g−1 in the absence of a sacrificial reagent and extra photosensitizer, roughly 13.9 and 45.7 times higher than that of g-C3N4-TiO2 (CT). WO3 can strongly interact with g-C3N4-TiO2 electronically, guiding electrons across the interface to the surface. The oxygen vacancies in WO3, as electron-enriched centers, not only enhance charge separation and form efficient charge transfer channels but also capture photogenerated electrons to suppress charge recombination. This strong interaction and oxygen vacancies in WO3 jointly improve photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, offering a feasible way to design efficient cocatalysts.",

Research has shown that plant extracts derived from plants of the genus Tabebuia exhibit potential applications in the search for new molecules with antiproliferative activity. Among the isolated molecules, the most evaluated correspond to β-lapachone (naphthoquinone); however, molecules with antiproliferative potential belonging to groups such as iridoids, flavonoids, quinones, furanonaphthoquinones, triterpenes, and polysaccharides have also been isolated and reported.

Through numerical simulations, we analyze the motion of particles from a reflecting boundary to an absorbing one. Properties of diffusive motion are explored by inspection of mean squared displacement and mean first passage time. The results show that the diffusion type depends on the drift strength. Without the drift, entropic forces induce effective superdiffusion; however, the increasing drift strength can counterbalance entropic forces and shift the system to standard diffusion and then effective subdiffusion. The mean squared displacement exhibits bending points for high drift values, as predicted by one-dimensional theoretical considerations. The study underscores the importance of considering deterministic and entropic forces in confined geometries.",

Therefore, a machine learning-based suspect screening combined with target screening was employed to comprehensively identify and quantify both legacy and novel PFASs in drinking water from the Yangtze River Delta, and their potential sources of contamination were determined through pollutant profile analysis.

    "abstract": "This study presents a sustainable, environmentally friendly synthetic route for the production of key intermediates in losartan using palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) derived from a brown seaweed, Sargassum incisifolium, as a recyclable nanocatalyst. A key intermediate, biaryl, was synthesized with an excellent yield (98%) via Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between 2-bromobenzonitrile and 4-methylphenylboronic acid, catalyzed using bio-derived PdNPs under mild conditions. Subsequent bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) under LED light, followed by imidazole coupling and tetrazole ring formation, allowed for the production of losartan with an overall yield of 27%. The PdNP catalyst exhibited high stability and recyclability, as well as strong catalytic activity, even at lower loadings, and nitrosamine formation was not detected. While the overall yield was lower than that of traditional industrial methods, this was due to the deliberate avoidance of the use of toxic reagents, hazardous solvents, and protection/deprotection steps commonly used in conventional routes. This trade-off marks a shift in pharmaceutical process development, where environmental and safety considerations are increasingly prioritized in line with green chemistry and regulatory frameworks. This study provides a foundation for green scaling up strategies, incorporating sustainability principles into drug synthesis.",

Langmuir and extended Langmuir equations in the Aspen adsorption module were used to describe the adsorption equilibrium of the single and bi-component SO2 and H2S system, respectively. The effects of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and temperature on the dynamic adsorption process of the bi-component SO2/H2S system were investigated. The concentration distribution and adsorption capacity of SO2/H2S in the bed were simulated. The results showed that the simulation for the single-component breakthrough curves of SO2 or H2S agreed well with the experimental data. It indicated that the model and simulation yielded engineering acceptable accuracy. For the bi-component adsorption, the competitive adsorption effect was observed, with H2S as the weakly adsorbed component and SO2 as the strongly adsorbed component. The dynamic adsorption process showed the sequence of initial adsorption, breakthrough, replacement, and equilibrium. The breakthrough curves were characterized by the distinct hump (roll-up) for H2S, resulting from the replacement effect. The influence of GHSV and the temperature on the dynamic adsorption process were investigated, revealing that the lower velocity and temperature enhanced the adsorption. This work might be used for the design and optimization of adsorption bed for the simultaneous removal of SO2 and H2S in Claus tail gas.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin E is widely used in cosmetics and dermatological applications for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties, yet its industrial use is limited by poor stability and bioavailability. To address these challenges, this study developed zein-based microstructures encapsulating vitamin E using electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques and evaluated how zein concentration affects morphology and release behavior. The SEM analysis showed that biopolymer (zein) concentration significantly affects microstructure morphology. At low concentrations (1%, 5%, and 15% (w/v)), micro/nanoparticles are formed, and high concentrations (30% (w/v)) yielded only fibers. The average size of the structures produced with zein (1–15% w/v) ranged from 0.38 to 0.90 µm, as measured using the program ImageJ (v1.54d). Structures containing vitamin E were generally smaller than those without. For electrospun fibers made with 30% zein, diameters ranged from 0.49 to 0.74 µm, with vitamin E-containing fibers also being thinner. Conductivity also influenced morphology; higher conductivity developed fibers, while lower conductivity formed particles. The solution with 15% (w/v) zein + 1% (w/w) vitamin E showed a conductivity of 1276 μS, similar to the 15% zein solution (1280 μS), indicating that vitamin E addition had no significant effect on conductivity. Release assays revealed that structures produced with low zein concentrations led to immediate release, while structured made with higher concentrations, prolonged release. A preliminary cosmetic formulation test has been conducted. The vitamin E microstructures were successfully incorporated into aloe vera hydrogel and coconut oil to show their potential for cosmetic applications.",

The objective of this review was to compile the latest advances in the development of computational models capable of identifying drugs already registered by the Food and Drug Administration for other indications with potential capacity to be applied as antimicrobials. We present studies that apply in silico methods such as machine learning, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and deep learning. Some of these studies have in vitro/in vivo results that demonstrate the reliability of this computational methodology in terms of the identification of effective molecules and new targets of interest in the treatment of infections. In addition, we present the methods that are under development and their future prospects in terms of the search for new antimicrobials.

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive technique—used for the local eradication of neoplastic cells—that exploits the interaction of light, oxygen, and a photo-responsive drug called photosensitizer (PS) for the local generation of lethal ROS. Push-pull chromophores, that bear electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups linked through a π-electron bridge, are characterized by a non-homogeneous charge distribution in their excited state, with charge transfer from one extremity of the chain to the other one (Internal Charge Transfer—ICT). This phenomenon has a direct impact on the photophysical features of the push-pull compounds, as the bathochromic shift of the emission maxima and intersystem crossing (ISC) of the excited state are directly connected with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In continuing our research regarding the synthesis and use of oligophenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) in PDT, two new push-pull glycosyl OPE-NOF and OPE-ONF—featuring electron-donor N,N-dimethylamino (N) and dimetoxyaryl (O) and acceptor tetrafluoroaryl (F) moieties on the OPE chain—have been efficiently prepared. The interchanged position of the D groups onto the conjugated skeleton was aimed to tune and optimize the push-pull effect, while the introduction of glucoside terminations was directed to give biocompatibility and bioaffinity to the chromophores. OPE-NOF, OPE-ONF, and the synthetic intermediates were fully characterized, and their photophysical properties were investigated by using UV-Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. OPE-NOF showed a strong charge-transfer character and high PDT effect on HeLa cancer cells when irradiated with non-harmful blue light, causing massive cancer cell death.",

    "abstract": "Quercetin (QUE) is a bioactive flavonoid that is naturally present in various fruits and possesses many pharmacological activities. Despite its health benefits, the bioavailability of quercetin is relatively low due to its crystalline form and hydrophobic structure. An approach to overcoming these drawbacks is its incorporation into amorphous polymer matrices. PLA and PLA/PEG fibrous materials loaded with QUE were obtained by electrospinning. The XRD analysis revealed a visible decrease in the crystallinity of QUE after its incorporation into PLA and PLA/PEG fibers. The obtained fibrous materials and, especially, the PLA/PEG mat loaded with the flavonoid exhibited high antioxidant activity due to the better wettability and higher release rate of the bioactive compound. Moreover, the PLA/QUE and PLA/PEG/QUE mats possessed antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, the antitumor activity of the prepared mats was tested against SH-4 cancer cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. The obtained results reveal that the QUE-loaded fibrous mats exhibited high anticancer activity against cancer cells but lower toxicity to normal keratinocytes. The combined antioxidant, antibacterial and in vitro antitumor activities render these novel PLA-based materials loaded with QUE promising candidates for wound dressing applications and for application in local tumor treatment.",

Our findings indicated that all three cyclodextrins form stable 1:1 inclusion complexes with dacarbazine. Among them, the complexes with HE-β-CD were the most thermodynamically stable. While the choice of solvent model had a minor impact on the structural properties of the complexes, it significantly affected thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and solvation free energy. The best agreement with experimental data—particularly for the Gibbs free energy of solvation—was observed when using the SMD model.",

This study evaluates the application of Fourier Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric models—Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR)—for rapid, non-destructive assessment of key MOL parameters: density, total lime content, calcium oxide availability, and sucrose content. Ninety samples were analyzed using both wet chemistry and FT-NIR. The predictive performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2). High predictive accuracy was observed for density (PLS: R2 = 0.8274; PCR: R2 = 0.8795) and calcium oxide availability (PLS: R2 = 0.9035; PCR: R2 = 0.9115). Total lime content showed moderate accuracy (PLS: R2 = 0.7748; PCR: R2 = 0.7983), while sucrose content exhibited low predictive power (PLS: R2 = 0.2312; PCR: R2 = 0.3747). The weak performance was noted for %CaO (PLS: R2 = 0.4893; PCR: R2 = 0.2409), likely due to spectral overlap and matrix complexity. Despite these challenges, FT-NIR remains a viable, reagent-free method for monitoring MOL, with the potential to enhance process control in the sugar industry. Future work should focus on refining calibration strategies and addressing spectral interferences to improve predictive accuracy for complex matrices.",

The objective of the study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of commercial essential oils derived from clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & Perry), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), and peppermint (Mentha piperita (L.) Huds.) against A. acidoterrestris. The effect of the essential oils on the mature biofilms of fifteen environmental A. acidoterrestris isolates subjected to variable pH values (3.0, 4.0, and 5.5), temperatures (25, 37, and 44 °C), and essential oil concentrations (0.5 MIC, MIC, and 2 MIC compared to planktonic cells) was studied. The essential oils showed significant antibiofilm activity against A. acidoterrestris isolates, with the efficiency of biofilm eradication depending on the strain and environmental parameters such as acidity, culture temperature, type, and concentration of essential oil. The greatest antibiofilm potential was observed for clove essential oil regardless of oil concentrations and environmental conditions. Cinnamon oil exhibited lower activity against the tested A. acidoterrestris strains. Peppermint essential oil showed the weakest antibiofilm ability and did not completely eradicate any strain biofilm of the tested strains. Clove and cinnamon essential oils have the potential to be effective alternatives to synthetic disinfectants directed against A. acidoterrestris grown in the form of biofilms.",

The efficiency of the osmotic dehydration process was assessed by analyzing its kinetic parameters. In selected samples of osmotically dehydrated fruits, physicochemical properties were evaluated, including dry matter content, total acidity, pH, sugar profile, color attributes, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity (measured by DPPH and ABTS assays), and vitamin C content. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the relationships among the measured variables and to identify underlying patterns within the dataset. Osmotic dehydration in xylitol significantly modified the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of apples, promoting substantial water loss and partial replacement of natural sugars with xylitol. The results showed that ultrasound pretreatment markedly influenced these effects, with treatment duration playing a critical role. Shorter ultrasound applications (15–30 min) enhanced xylitol uptake while better preserving antioxidant activity and color, whereas longer ultrasound treatments (45 min) achieved greater mass transfer but led to higher losses of bioactive compounds compared to untreated samples.",

For implant-coating applications, using NIR laser stimulation could be challenging in practice, especially for porous orthopedic implants. This article investigates whether BP nanoflakes, suspended in Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogels, remain effective against Staphylococcus aureus without photonic activation. The experimental results showed 89.4 ± 7.6% bacterial inhibition from BP nanoflakes at a 5120 µg/mL concentration via passive diffusion in F127; however, it could not kill all the bacteria present. It is hypothesized that the F127 gel interface could create a barrier between the bacteria, which continue to multiply in media, and the antimicrobial black phosphorus compound, which degrades in the F127.",

This study examines the antibacterial activities of fifteen flavonoids found in Terminalia spp. against a range of gastrointestinal pathogens using broth dilution assays. Flavonoids were also combined with six different classes of conventional antibiotics to investigate interactions. The efflux pump inhibitory activity of the flavonoid was evaluated using ethidium bromide accumulation and efflux assays. Toxicities were assessed via human dermal fibroblast cell line assays. Fisetin, hispidulin, isoorientin, orientin, rutin, and vitexin showed noteworthy growth inhibitory activity (MIC values 62.5–250 µg/mL). Isoorientin and orientin were most potent against Bacillus cereus and Alcaligenes faecalis, displaying MIC values of 62.5 µg/mL against both bacteria. All flavonoids except genistein, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, taxifolin, and vitexin were nontoxic in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell proliferation assays. When individual flavonoids were combined with selected antibiotics, some potentiated the activity of these antibiotics. Two synergistic, eighteen additive and thirty-one non-interactive interactions were observed. The synergistic interactions were all observed in combination with orientin. Notably, orientin exhibited efflux pump inhibitory effects at concentrations from 15.26 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL. The findings reported herein indicate that the selected flavonoids have the potential for addressing bacterial antibiotic resistance and highlight the need for further study.",

Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation.",

This study aimed to characterize the phenolic profile of Corallodiscus flabellatus (or C. flabellata) and elucidate its mechanistic interactions with tyrosinase under high-altitude environments with intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Two novel phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and seven known compounds were isolated using silica gel, ODS, and preparative HPLC, with structures determined via NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and acid hydrolysis. Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) inhibition assays revealed divergent effects: compound 7 (containing a caffeoyl moiety) exhibited potent inhibition (IC50 = 0.23 μM), comparable to arbutin, while other PhGs displayed activation or biphasic responses. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compound 7 stabilized tyrosinase via π-π stacking with Phe264 and Cu²⁺ coordination, whereas activating compounds likely acted as substrates. These findings elucidate the dual regulatory function of PhGs, which activate tyrosinase to counteract acute ultraviolet-induced stress and inhibit its activity to attenuate oxidative overload, thereby advancing our understanding of alpine plant adaptation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the extraction, characterization, and biological evaluation of diterpenes from green coffee beans, specifically, cafestol and kahweol. These compounds, known for their potential health benefits, were isolated via optimized extraction and saponification processes. Separation was achieved using silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel, and structural elucidation was performed through advanced 1D and 2D NMR techniques, including HSQC, HMBC, and (IN)ADEQUATE. Due to kahweol’s instability, the research prioritized cafestol for the synthesis of rhodamine B conjugates. Initial ester-linked conjugates proved unstable, prompting the development of more robust derivatives through amide linkage strategies and further functionalization via acetylation and oxidation reactions. Some oxidation methods led to furan ring cleavage, impacting structural integrity. Selected compounds were tested for cytotoxicity using SRB assays on human tumor cell lines (MCF7, A2780) and non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). While the parent diterpenes and many derivatives showed minimal activity, several cafestol–rhodamine B conjugates demonstrated notable cytotoxic effects. Compound 6, in particular, exhibited selective activity against cancer cells with reduced toxicity toward non-malignant cells.",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that all three complexes adopt similar vacant octahedron (C4v) geometries with the halide ligand in one axial position. Magnetic studies demonstrate that these complexes exhibit field-induced slow magnetic relaxation behaviors, with positive D values of 25.3(2), 21.6(1), and 19.4(2) cm−1 for 1Cl, 2Br, and 3I, respectively. Detailed analysis of the relaxation dynamics reveals that Raman processes dominate at higher temperatures, with systematic variations in relaxation parameters across the series. The systematic variations in magnetic anisotropy and slow magnetic relaxation behaviors of the three complexes correlate with the decreasing electronegativity of the halide ligands.",

SOD1 mutations have a significant role in the pathophysiology and fast behavior of protopathic proteins in ALS illness. The E100K mutation may be useful in uncovering the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1 associated with ALS. According to several studies, giving small molecule inhibitors made from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds may be a viable treatment strategy for neurological conditions. Using molecular docking and MD simulations, we have identified a potential flavonoid drug that may successfully inhibit SOD1’s amyloidogenic activity. Puerarin, Fisetin, and Peonidin provided intriguing pharmacological hints during the initial screening of flavonoids. The Fisetin-E100K complex had a larger residual energy contribution and substantial binding than other flavonoid compounds. The findings showed that, unlike other materials, Fisetin increased the structural stability, hydrophobicity, and flexibility of the mutant while reducing the amount of β-sheets. Furthermore, to distinguish aggregation in the mutant (unbound/bound) states, we displayed modifications in the free energy landscape (FEL). As a result, Fisetin was identified as having therapeutic potential against the E100K, which might make it a viable pharmacological option for the creation of inhibitors that lower the chance of ALS death.",

This study reports for the first time the implementation of the microbial dye violacein, obtained by Janthinobacterium lividum batch cultivation, as SERS probe, as a suitable substitutive to the most employed toxic chemical dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). The interaction of the proposed natural probe with the metal surface after the adsorption and the presence of local electromagnetic fields were evaluated by computational approach. The SERS devices developed were decorated by applying a single-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) decoration method and characterized using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The platform showed a remarkable sensitivity, achieving a detection limit of 10–7 M for violacein, allowing to point out the strong potential of this natural microbial dye as a sustainable probe molecule for low-concentration analytes detection on SERS-active substrates, making them suitable for several application fields, such as environmental monitoring, food safety, cultural heritage analysis and diagnostics.

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation plays a pivotal role in human semen, influencing various processes, such as spermatogenesis, maturation, sperm motility, capacitation, and fertilization. Despite its importance, the specific details regarding N/O-glycosylation within human semen proteins have largely remained unknown. To address this challenge, an integrated glycoproteomic platform (termed GlycoIP) was developed, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both intact N- and O-glycopeptides directly from human semen samples. Characterizing these intact glycopeptides is particularly challenging, yet it provides invaluable insights into the structure and function of both glycans and their attachment sites. In this study, our platform enabled the identification of 1,833 unique N-glycopeptides and 720 unique O-glycopeptides. This approach revealed extensive and precise site-specific N/O-glycosylation data, highlighting 438 potential O-glycosylation sites from 148 distinct O-glycoproteins. Notably, we conducted site-specific N/O-glycosylation profiling on several unique glycoproteins, including sperm equatorial segment protein 1 (SPESP1), which is located on human sperm, and plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), which is presented in both sperm and seminal plasma. In summary, this platform provides a promising approach for comprehensive profiling of protein site-specific N/O-glycosylation within a single experiment. This advancement paves the way for further functional studies on glycoproteins and their roles in male infertility, enhancing our understanding of this complex field.",

This study aimed to optimize the therapeutic potential of brevinin-1pl, a frog-derived AMP with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities.MethodsMajor experimental approaches encompassed antibacterial activity evaluation, hemolytic potential assessment, bactericidal rate determination via time-kill kinetics, SYTOX Green-based membrane integrity analysis, and MTT assays for anti-proliferative effects.ResultsSubstitutions with arginine (brevinin-1pl-2R and brevinin-1pl-5R) enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria but reduced efficacy against Gram-negative strains. Lysine substitution (brevinin-1pl-6K) decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria due to reduced hydrophobicity. In contrast, histidine substitution (brevinin-1pl-3H) showed diminished activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., MRSA MIC increased from 2 µM to 4 µM) but reduced hemolysis, indicating improved selectivity. Mechanistic studies using SYTOX green assays confirmed membrane disruption as a primary mode of action, while suggesting alternative mechanisms for Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The brevinin-1pl and its analogues demonstrated significant inhibitory efficacy against both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and H838 non-small cell lung cancer cells at a concentration of 10–4 M. Notably, brevinin-1pl-3H exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal HaCaT cells despite its high hydrophobicity, suggesting potential for dermatological applications.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that strategic amino acid substitutions can optimize the therapeutic potential of AMPs, offering a promising approach to develop peptides with enhanced efficacy and reduced clinical side effects.",

We have used two types of oxide nanoparticles, namely, Al2O3 and γ- Al2O3, with water and C2H6O2. The purpose of this study is to investigate an innovative comparative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid flow and heat transport with the impact of thermal radiation on water and ethylene glycol (EG) suspended with Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. A novel comparison of concentration of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ Al2O3–C2H6O2 nanofluids is investigated under the influence of chemical reactions. The system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was obtained via a similarity transformation and then solved using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) in Mathematica. The temperature and velocity profiles are obtained numerically for a range of controlling parameter values, including the volume percentage φ of nanomaterials, the magnetic effect parameter M, the radiation parameter Rd, and Eckert number Ec in convergent/divergent channels. The concentration profiles of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 tri-nanofluids are calculated numerically for governing parameter values, including those accounting for chemical reactions. The investigation’s findings indicate that there is greater heat transport in γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 and γ-Al2O3–H2O than in Al2O3–H2O. We have demonstrated that there is good agreement between the current results and those found in the literature for various values of the magnetic field parameter, thermal radiation parameter, and nanoparticle volume fraction.",

    "abstract": "Trifluoromethylation stands as a pivotal technology in modern synthetic chemistry, playing an indispensable role in drug design, functional material development, and agrochemical innovation. With the growing emphasis on green chemistry principles, the pursuit of environmentally benign trifluoromethylation strategies has emerged as a critical research frontier. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), characterized by its cost-effectiveness, stability, and low toxicity, has become a promising alternative to conventional trifluoromethylation reagents. This review systematically summarizes advancements in photocatalytic decarboxylative trifluoromethylation using TFA and its derivatives over the past decade, focusing on three key activation mechanisms: single-electron transfer (SET), electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-mediated pathways, and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This paradigm shift is driven by the intrinsic limitations of conventional thermal decarboxylation, particularly its reliance on harsh conditions and significant environmental burdens. In contrast, photocatalytic strategies enable efficient C–CF3 bond construction under mild conditions, offering a modular platform for synthesizing fluorinated functional molecules. Strategic research priorities should focus on overcoming fundamental challenges, including but not limited to optimizing photosensitizer catalytic efficiency, establishing regioselective manipulation strategies, and engineering multicomponent tandem reaction systems to achieve trifluoromethylation methodologies under mild conditions. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic investigations with artificial intelligence-driven reaction prediction will accelerate the advancement of precision trifluoromethylation technologies. This progress is anticipated to provide sustainable synthetic solutions for next-generation fluorinated pharmaceuticals and advanced functional materials, effectively bridging the innovation gap between academic research and industrial implementation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAlcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is a common consequence of chronic alcohol consumption, characterized by lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes play essential roles in metabolizing alcohol and other compounds. However, the specific long-term effects of alcohol on these enzymes remain unclear.MethodsThis study the examines influence of prolonged ethanol exposure on CYP450 activity and expression in AFLD using a rat model. Key enzymes such as CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1 were assessed in relation to lipid accumulation and oxidative stress.ResultsSignificant alterations were identified in the expression and activity of CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1, which were associated with increased lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Additionally, the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was elevated, suggesting that chronic alcohol intake may impact drug transport and excretion.DiscussionThese findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AFLD and highlight the potential of CYP450 modulation as a therapeutic target. By elucidating how long-term ethanol exposure disrupts hepatic CYP450 enzyme profiles, this research lays the groundwork for developing personalized therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients with AFLD.",

    "abstract": "Today, wastewater treatment is essential and inevitable due to the water crisis caused by climate change and population growth. Although numerous methods and synthetic compounds have been successful in practical and laboratory applications, developing novel multifunctional compounds remains of interest to scientists. For this purpose, a new nanofiber containing Cobalt-MOF (metal-organic framework), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which are known environmentally friendly polymers, was synthesized. After characterization and structure determination, the nanofiber was investigated for its ability to adsorb Congo Red dye and inhibit known microbial species in wastewater. This study showed that 91% of the 400 mg/L Congo red solution was absorbed by 0.06 g/L of the synthesized Cobalt-MOF/PVA-PVP Nanofibers at 1 h. Additionally, seven well-known strains (including Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Giardia lamblia) in wastewater were inhibited (with MIC of 8 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL) to the extent that some antibiotics could not affect them. This performance of the newly synthesized nanofiber can be attributed to its physical, chemical, and structural characteristics, such as compounds with biological properties present in its structure, as well as its high specific surface area. Therefore, researching and synthesizing similar compounds using the method presented in this study can lead to their development and application in wastewater treatment processes.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly efficient, recyclable adsorbents for heavy metal remediation remains a critical challenge in environmental engineering. This study introduces a novel cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized magnesium silicate (CTAB/MS) nano-adsorbent was synthesized through a multi-step surface modification of serpentinite involving intercalation with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol treatment, and CTAB incorporation. The resulting nanostructure was extensively characterized and applied for the removal of cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), and copper (Cu2+) ions from contaminated water. The characterization findings confirmed significant morphological and structural modifications, including enhanced surface area, functional group availability, and mesoporosity, which contributed to enhanced adsorption performance. The kinetic modeling confirmed that the process predominantly followed a pseudo-first-order model, suggesting that rapid physisorption mechanisms controlled the initial adsorption phase. Equilibrium studies revealed that adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous active sites, with maximum adsorption capacities of 491.9 mg/g (Cd2+), 481.8 mg/g (Co2+), and 434.3 mg/g (Cu2+) at 303 K. Furthermore, statistical physics-based isotherm model incorporating steric and energetic parameters provided deeper mechanistic insights. The adsorption energy (ΔE) values remained below 12.66 kJ/mol, confirming a predominantly physical adsorption process, while thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic and spontaneous nature, as evidenced by negative free enthalpy (G) and internal energy (Eint) values. The recyclability assessment demonstrated that CTAB/MS retained over 70% of its adsorption efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles, underscoring its long-term applicability in water treatment. This highlights the potential of CTAB/MS as an advanced, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for large-scale water purification.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAstragali Radix (AR) - Curcumae Rhizoma (vinegar processed, CR) herb pair was recorded in ‘YIXUE ZHONGZHONG CANXILU’ to treat colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Hedysari Radix (HR) was categorized under the AR entry in ‘SHENNONG BENCAO JING’. HR is still an alternative to AR paired with CR clinically in northwest China. Hedysari Radix Praeparata Cum Melle (HRPCM) is a product that HR fries with honey to enhance the therapeutic effect. However, the mechanism of HRPCM paired with CR (HRCR) in CAC needs to be further elucidated.MethodsHRCR-MIAS were prepared using the eversion intestinal sac method. UHPLC Q-Exactive-MS investigated the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. Then, the mechanism of HRCR in CAC mice was predicted based on network pharmacology analysis in combination with the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. The pharmacodynamic effects of HRCR-MIAS for SW620 colon cancer cells were invested in vitro. The efficacies of HRCR low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (HRCR-L, 3.413 g/kg; HRCR-M, 6.825 g/kg; HRCR-H, 13.650 g/kg) in CAC mice were explored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to assay The inflammatory factors levels, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum. The expressions of the intestinal permeability proteins, such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1, were detected via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Finally, the predicted signalling was verified by Western blot (WB).Results855 common components were identified in HRCR and HRCR-MIAS, and 25 specific components in HRCR-MIAS were pointed out. Based on network pharmacology analysis, the inflammatory response and the cross-linked MAPK signalling and NF-kB signalling were predicted to be the main reasons for HRCR in CAC. HRCR-MIAS inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, regulated the cell cycle progression, and restrained the SW620 cells’ ability to migrate and invade in vitro. The outcomes of the WB experiment exhibited that HRCR-MIAS inhibited the expression of key proteins such as MEKK1, RAS, ERK, IKB and NF-kB in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling pathway of SW620 cells. The study in vivo found that the different doses of HRCR recovered the loss of body weight, the shortened colon length, the increased tumour counts, the abnormal changes in spleen and thymus indices, the colonic lesions, the unbalanced inflammatory factors levels like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, and the down-regulated intestinal permeability proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Experimental validation by WB confirmed that HRCR inhibited the expression of the key proteins, including MEKK1 RAS, ERK, IKB, and NF-kB, in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling in CAC mice.DiscussionHRCR not only suppresses the process of colonic inflammation and improves intestinal permeability but also relieves CAC by inhibiting the activated MAPK/NF-kB signalling cascade to alleviate CAC.",

We employed K-Banhatti topological descriptors and analyzed the findings to achieve this. For estimation of physicochemical properties of pneumonia treatment drugs we utilized linear, quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic regression analyses.Results and ConclusionThe drugs comprise linezolid, ceftabiprole, and clarithromycin, among others. Topological descriptors enable the exploration of the complexity, connectivity, and other essential attributes of molecules. The quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis of pharmaceuticals for illness treatment employing K-Banhatti topological descriptors is an economical approach utilised by pharmaceutical researchers. We performed a QSPR analysis on 20 anti-pneumonia drugs to ascertain the most precise predictions for five properties: enthalpy, flash point, molecular weight, molar volume, and molar refractivity, employing five K-Banhatti indices. To do this, we used linear, quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic regression analyses to find links between molecules and the physical and chemical properties of drugs used to treat pneumonia.

The functional groups identified in the extracted natural dye were described using an FTIR spectrophotometer.Results and discussionUsing methanol as the solvent and 5 g of seed at 60°C for 60 min, the highest color yield was observed in USB. Using the ultrasonic water bath dyeing method at 60°C for 40 min without using any moderant, cotton, silk fabric, and leather were effectively colored in a yellow-orange color. The L*, a*, and b* values of the dyed material treated using the USB approach were 80.95, 4.52, 75.35 for cotton, 88.65, -1.35, 62.85 for silk, and 79.55, 015.35, 66.45 for leather, respectively. Compared to the other bacterial reduction, 85.25% of the colored materials showed substantial antibacterial action against Staphylococcus sp. Vibrio sp. (76.69%), Pseudomonas sp. (75.83%), Klebsiella sp. (74.24%), and Micrococcus sp. (74.21%) were the following most prevalent bacteria. The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) measurements showed that leather and cotton treated with B. orellana seed dye had higher UV radiation shielding properties.",

    "abstract": "Epoxy zinc-rich coatings usually require high zinc content to ensure its anti-corrosion performance. However, excessive zinc powder content will reduce the mechanical properties of the coating, increase the economic cost, harm the environment, etc. Therefore, this paper aims to reduce the amount of zinc powder and improve the corrosion performance of epoxy zinc-rich coatings by introducing two kinds of conductive particle materials, conductive graphene-mica powder and conductive nickel. Conductive graphene was first loaded on mica powder and the obtained conductive graphene-mica powder and the conductive nickel were introduced to the epoxy zinc-rich coatings to partially replace zinc component. The anti-corrosion properties of the coating were systematically evaluated by EIS and salt spray test. The resulting epoxy zinc-rich coating with nickel powder or conductive graphene-mica demonstrates outstanding salt spray resistance, lasting up to 2,000 h, exhibiting superior anti-corrosion performance at reduced zinc content of 60% or 45% compared to conventional coatings with 70% pure zinc powder. This study introduces a novel conductive mica material and investigates conductive metal nickel additive, effectively reducing zinc content in epoxy zinc-rich coatings, which offers valuable insights for developing high-performance anti-corrosion coatings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract2D hybrid perovskites with diversified species and tunable physical properties have emerged as versatile platforms for applications in many fields such as photovoltaics, light‐emitting diodes, ferroics, and so on. However, reports of thermally stable dielectric switching behavior in molecularly tailored 2D lead‐free copper chloride perovskites are limited. In this work, we employed monofluoride substitution to successfully regulate the crystal symmetry to achieve high‐temperature structural phase transition and switchable dielectric responses in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 (2‐FEA = 2‐fluoroethylaminium). Fluorine substitution establishes intermolecular C─H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions among the organic cations, driving a symmetry‐breaking transition from the parent tetragonal (EA)2CuCl4 (EA = ethylaminium) to a monoclinic phase in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 but it maintains a 2D perovskite structure. Consequently, (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 undergoes an evident order‐disorder structural transition (P21/c‐Cmce) around 351 K accompanied by dielectric switching behavior. Besides, eye‐catching thermochromic behavior has been evidenced by variable‐temperature UV–vis spectra revealing a temperature‐dependent bandgap redshift. This finding establishes fluoride substitution as a powerful strategy for the molecular engineering of multifunctional materials while providing valuable insights for the rational design of stimuli‐responsive hybrid systems.",

Studies have demonstrated that CatS plays a pivotal role in antigen presentation and is associated with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity, positioning it as a potential target in related disorders. Consequently, the development of a selective and straightforward method for detecting CatS is crucial. In this study, we introduce a colorimetric approach utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and CatS‐specific peptides for the detection of CatS activity. The CatS enzyme cleavage peptides, PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2, can stabilize AuNPs in a hydrosaline solution without aggregation. Upon hydrolysis of PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 by CatS, the AuNPs aggregate with a color change from red to blue. After optimizing the size of the AuNPs and the concentration of the peptides, the limits of detection for CatS were both to be 10 nM, when PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 were used to protect the AuNPs. Therefore, this colorimetric assay, which employs peptides and AuNPs, enables not only a selective but also a simple detection of CatS, visible to the naked eye.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnveloped viruses utilize membrane fusion to enter the host cell and cause viral diseases. Most conventional inhibitors are target‐specific and ineffective against broad‐spectrum viral infections. Therefore, the current scenario demands developing inhibitors to attenuate the membrane properties instead of targeting the viral proteins. In the present work, we have designed a new WD‐containing peptide (dmTG‐23) by introducing a WD repeat at the center of the peptide sequence using mTG‐23 peptide as a template and a 14‐amino acid peptide with seven WD repeats (WD‐14), and tested their efficacies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐induced fusion assay. Our findings show that both dmTG‐23 and WD‐14 prevent PEG‐induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol concentrations, with a higher effect for dmTG‐23. Moreover, we have compared our results with our previous observations on TG‐23 and mTG‐23 to evaluate the importance of the number and position of WD repeats in the peptide sequence to impart the highest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that three WD repeat‐containing dmTG‐23 shows the highest efficacy against the PEG‐induced fusion of SUVs by enhancing the membrane order at the acyl chain region. This result is significantly important in designing peptide‐based broad‐spectrum fusion inhibitors.",

It was shown that a larger strong Brønsted acidity enhanced the total aromatics formation with an increased light arenes content (especially at elevated WHSV). At low WHSV, excess Brønsted acidity leads to the declined aromatics yield due to its high cracking ability. On the contrary, a higher Lewis acidity and extensive mesoporosity promoted the heavier aromatics production accelerating the coke formation and shortening the catalyst lifetime. An improved aromatization performance and a prolonged durability of the zeolite catalyst were controlled by a balanced Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio and the ratio of WHSV to acid site concentration.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo elucidate the emergence and amplification of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral molecules and their assemblies, we designed positionally isomeric chiral V‐shaped Schiff base ligands and their corresponding bis(boron difluoride) complexes. The ligands were synthesized by condensing chiral cyclohexanediamine with either 1‐hydroxy‐2‐naphthaldehyde or 2‐hydroxy‐1‐naphthaldehyde, followed by complexation with boron difluoride (BF2) to yield CNB1 and CNB2, respectively. While the parent Schiff bases exhibited no CPL, BF2 coordination induced strong CPL signals in solution. Remarkably, upon aggregation in a mixed solvent system, CNB2 displayed enhanced and inverted CPL, whereas its isomer CNB1 showed attenuated emission. Through comprehensive characterization and singlecrystal analysis, we attribute this divergent behavior to distinct molecular packing modes: CNB2 forms tightly stacked aggregates with efficient π─π interactions, while CNB1 adopts a less ordered arrangement. This study establishes a clear correlation between subtle structural modifications, supramolecular packing, and CPL performance, offering a rational strategy for tailoring chiroptical properties through precise molecular design and controlled self‐assembly.",

This study presents a bifunctional imidazole‐functionalized Hf(IV)‐based metal–organic framework (MOF), 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesizing 1,4‐dihydropyridines (1,4‐DHPs), which are key moieties in the synthesis of drugs used for cardiovascular treatments. The solvent‐free activated form of 1, labeled as 1′ catalyzes both Biginelli and Hantzsch reactions under mild conditions. The Biginelli reaction using aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea proceeded at 80 °C in 0.5 h with a 99% yield, while the Hantzsch reaction with aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate occurred at room temperature in ethanol within 1 h, also achieving a 99% yield. Compound 1′ showed broad substrate compatibility in both reactions. Additionally, the MOF exhibited excellent sensing ability for the anticancer drug raloxifene (RLX), showing a fast turn‐off fluorescence response (within 5 s), a low detection limit (9 nM), and a high Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv, 2 × 106 M⁻¹), enabling sensitive detection in diverse environments, including wastewater and biofluids. Detailed investigations into catalytic mechanisms and detection capabilities provide valuable insights for advancing drug synthesis and analytical methodologies.

In this work, cellulose is derivatized with a thiol‐containing amino acid, cysteine, via two approaches to enhance silver anchoring by exploiting the high affinity between thiol groups and soft metals. The first method involves direct esterification to produce Cel‐Cys‐Est, while the second uses periodate oxidation to form dialdehyde cellulose (DAC), followed by linking with cysteine via a Schiff base reaction, creating DAC‐Cys. After confirming the successful cysteine derivatization using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the adsorption characteristics towards silver ions have been optimized for parameters like pH, adsorbent dosage, and ion concentration. The kinetic studies have shown the pseudo‐second‐order model for silver ion adsorption over both materials, while the isotherm studies have indicated Langmuir‐type monolayer adsorption. The silver‐loaded DAC‐Cys, having higher adsorption capacity, has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work highlights the versatility of cysteine‐derivatized cellulose as an effective, eco‐friendly material for silver ion sequestration and its promising application in antimicrobial domains.",

Mechanistic investigations revealed that the formation of stable metallogels is facilitated by a synergistic combination of multiple noncovalent interactions, including Zn(II)‐hydrazide coordination, solvophobic effects, and π─π stacking interactions. These dendritic metallogels exhibited intelligent stimuli‐responsive behavior, undergoing reversible gel–sol phase transitions in response to various external stimuli, such as temperature and chemical inputs. Furthermore, the dendritic metallogel, particularly in its xerogel form, demonstrated exceptional efficacy (>94% within 10 hours) and outstanding adsorption capacity (800 mg/g) in the removal of Hg2⁺ ions from aqueous solutions, highlighting its potential for environmental remediation applications.",

The direct esterification and amidation of thioester are achieved without using toxic and hazardous reagents and with minimal waste production. Significantly, direct amidation of thioester was exploited to achieve diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amides derived from various electron‐rich, electron‐deficient amines. It is noteworthy that different amino ester and amino alcohol derivatives also participated in the direct amidation reaction and delivered the corresponding amides in good yields.

To address this, here we report the synthesis of cysteine‐capped copper nanoclusters (Cys‐Cu NCs) in just 30 min under ambient aqueous conditions. The incorporation of γ‐cyclodextrin (γ‐CD) enhanced the stability and immediately amplified the photoluminescence of the nanoclusters by triggering aggregation‐induced emission (AIE), increasing their quantum yield from 0.15 to 0.24. The remarkable photoluminescence of γ‐CD‐assisted Cys‐Cu NCs (γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs) was selectively quenched by protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), enabling ultrasensitive detection with an exceptionally low limit of 70 pM. Stern–Volmer analysis revealed the underlying interaction mechanisms between γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs and PPIX. This precise detection of PPIX is critical for diagnosing and monitoring porphyrias and other heme‐related disorders. The method demonstrated excellent PPIX recovery in complex biological matrices, such as human serum and artificial urine, across a broad PPIX concentration range (0.5–10 µM), highlighting its applicability in real‐world systems. Additionally, the nanoclusters exhibited strong sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS), underscoring their potential for oxidative stress monitoring. These findings position γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs as a versatile, cost‐effective, diagnostic tool for clinical and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen-like light muonic ions, in which one negative muon replaces all of the electrons, are extremely sensitive probes of nuclear structure. Using pulsed laser spectroscopy, we have measured three 2\n            S\n            -2\n            P\n            transitions in the muonic helium-3 (μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            ) ion, an ion formed by a negative muon and bare helium-3 nucleus. This allowed us to extract the Lamb shift, the 2\n            P\n            fine structure splitting, and the 2\n            S\n            -hyperfine splitting in μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            . Comparing these measurements with theory, we determined the root-mean-square charge radius of the helion (\n            3\n            He nucleus) to be\n            \n              r\n              h\n            \n            = 1.97007(94) fm, in good agreement with the value from elastic electron scattering but a factor 15 more accurate. Our results represent benchmarks for few-nucleon theories and open the way for precision quantum electrodynamics tests in He atoms and ions.",

    "abstract": "Antagonistic activities of the 53BP1 axis and the tumor suppressor BRCA1-BARD1 determine whether DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by end joining or homologous recombination. We show that the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a central 53BP1 axis component, suppresses DNA end resection by EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex but acts by distinct mechanisms in restricting these entities. Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis.",

However, central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic. A lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. Here, we silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.",

    "abstract": "Interfacial polymerization has been an industrial standard for preparing desalination membranes. Extending the same concept to molecular separation of organic solvents would be a key enabler for the decarbonization of the chemical and petrochemical industries through energy-efficient crude or biocrude oil fractionation. Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts. These membranes, which feature fast and selective transport of hydrocarbons, including multicomponent and industrially relevant mixtures, outperform commercial and state-of-the-art benchmark membranes.",

    "abstract": "The Biological Weapons Convention turned 50 this year. Since 1975, the intent of this international treaty has been to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. Global commitment to these objectives is reflected by the treaty’s total membership of 188 states. However, member states have thus far been unable to raise strong barriers against illicit bioweapons development. With rapid advancements in science and technology and the rise of biological weapons disinformation, improvements of the Convention are urgently needed. One way to reinforce the treaty is to consider an inspection mechanism that aims to disrupt illicit programs rather than detect them.",

    "abstract": "A stellar common envelope occurs in a binary system when the atmosphere of an evolving star expands to encompass an orbiting companion object. Such systems are predicted to evolve rapidly, ejecting the stellar envelope and leaving the companion in a tighter orbit around a stripped star. We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.",

In this work, we show that this competitive cancellation is essential for understanding computation in the cerebellum. In marmosets, we identified a vector for each Purkinje cell (P cell) along which its spikes displaced the eyes. Two spikes in two different P cells produced superposition of their vectors. In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.",

We generated a global-scale understanding of marine heteroprokaryotic functional biogeography by synthesizing genetic sequencing data with a mechanistic marine ecosystem model. We incorporated heteroprokaryotic diversity into the trait-based model along two axes: substrate lability and growth strategy. Using genetic sequences along three ocean transects, we compiled 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds and estimated their degree of optimization for rapid growth (copiotrophy). Data and model consistency indicated that gradients in grazing and substrate lability predominantly set biogeographical patterns, and we identified deep-ocean “slow copiotrophs” whose ecological interactions control the surface accumulation of dissolved organic carbon.",

The direct effect is “brain drain”—a decrease in the country’s human capital stock. However, there may also be indirect “brain gain” effects. This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration. We discuss conditions under which beneﬁts from skilled migration may outweigh costs and also describe potential research paths to inform policy.",

Several of these giants have vanished within the past 130,000 years, but the timing and macroevolutionary drivers behind this pattern of rise and collapse remain unclear for some megaherbivore lineages. Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.",

This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Supramolecular polymers, bonded through directional non-covalent interactions, closely mimic dynamic behaviors of biological nanofibers. However, the complexity of assembly pathways makes it highly challenging to unravel the nature of supramolecular dynamics in aqueous environments. Here we introduce a precise combinatorial titration methodology to probe in situ the assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PAs). This approach reveals a binary assembly mechanism governed by equilibrium between spheroidal micelles and β-sheet polymers. Weakening hydrogen bonding shifts the equilibrium towards micelles and decreases the internal structural order of filamentous polymers, promoting supramolecular dynamics. Extending this methodology to two-component copolymerization systems, we find a surprising tendency to form blocky nanostructures with reduced internal phase separation as the mismatch in peptide sequence decreases. Interestingly, while well-mixed copolymers acquire different dynamics, mismatched ones retain the characteristic supramolecular motion of their homopolymer counterparts. These critical insights into supramolecular dynamics offer strategies to tailor the dynamic functions of supramolecular nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The Wingless/Int-1 (WNT) signaling network is essential to orchestrate central physiological processes such as embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. In the currently held tenet, WNT/β-catenin signaling is initiated by WNT-induced recruitment of Frizzleds (FZDs) and LRP5/6 followed by the formation of a multiprotein signalosome complex. Here, we use bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to show that different WNT paralogs dynamically trigger FZD-LRP6 association. While WNT-induced receptor interaction was independent of C-terminal LRP6 phosphorylation, it was allosterically modulated by binding of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL) to FZD. WNT-16B emerged as a ligand of particular interest, as it efficiently promoted FZD-LRP6 association but, unlike WNT-3A, did not lead to WNT/β-catenin signaling. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed distinct transcriptional fingerprints of WNT-3A and WNT-16B stimulation in HEK293 cells. Additionally, single-molecule tracking demonstrated that, despite increasing FZD5 and LRP6 confinement, WNT-16B stimulation did not result in formation of higher-order receptor clusters, in contrast to WNT-3A. Our results suggest that FZD-WNT-LRP5/6 complex formation alone is not sufficient for the initiation of WNT/β-catenin signaling.

So far, most of the reported work is conducted on metal substrates and relies on unconventional mechanisms, thereby precluding a direct transposition of well-established organic reactions from solutions to surfaces. In addition, the intrinsic properties and reactivity of metal substrates often limit the activation methods available to trigger on-surface reactions, and photoinduced processes are especially difficult to handle due to quenching of the adsorbed precursor molecules. Herein, the photoinduced deoxygenation of dibenzothiophene S-oxide (DBTO) derivatives is transposed from solutions to insulating alkali halide surfaces in ultra-high vacuum. By combining in-solution and on-surface investigations by means of scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, as well as bias spectroscopy measurements, we provide evidence of the successful on-surface deoxygenation of individual DBTO derivatives under UV irradiation. The photoinduced deoxygenation is conducted at low temperature (",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.",

While phosphate was likely the main phosphorus source for life during the Archean, phosphite (HPO3\n            2\n            −) gained importance leading up to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, the concentration of phosphite in seawater at that time, and the processes driving this shift in P utilization, remain poorly constrained. Using lab experiments and phosphite data from banded iron formations (BIFs), we show that hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) preferentially remove phosphate over phosphite. This suggests that shallow seawater at the onset of the GOE could have contained up to 0.17 µM phosphite, comprising 5–88% of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus. We propose that phosphate depletion driven by HFO adsorption and microbial competition may have promoted the use of phosphite as an alternative P source.",

However, evolving new aaRS/tRNA pairs traditionally relies on a labor-intensive process that often yields aaRSs with suboptimal ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Here, we present an OrthoRep-mediated strategy for aaRS evolution, which we demonstrate in 8 independent aaRS evolution campaigns, yielding multiple aaRSs that incorporate an overall range of 13 ncAAs tested. Some evolved systems enable ncAA-dependent translation at single amber codons with similar efficiency as natural translation at sense codons. Additionally, we discover an aaRS that regulated its own expression to enhance ncAA dependency. These findings demonstrate the potential of OrthoRep-driven aaRS evolution platforms to advance the field of GCE.",

Although exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1 to 2 micrometers, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons enables extended transport lengths and offers opportunities to use photonic mode engineering for tailored transport. Conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons, however, are challenging to tune and integrate into photonic circuits. We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration. We achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in transport length compared to bare excitons and reveal transport dependence on polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which are controlled via photonic crystal design and pump intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport.

These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1-SPNs by M1 and D2-SPNs by PrL, respectively. In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD, the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL-DMS pathway was reversed, leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr\n            607\n            site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS.

However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects. Our findings open the door for moiré flatband cavity–enhanced quantum light sources and quantum nodes for the quantum internet.",

However, it remains unclear whether the hippocampus drives the communication of predictions to sensory cortex or receives prediction signals from elsewhere. We collected 7-tesla fMRI data in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) while auditory cues predicted abstract shapes. Strikingly, neural patterns evoked by predicted shapes in CA2/3, pre/parasubiculum, and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were negatively correlated to patterns evoked by the same shapes when actually presented. Using layer-specific analyses, we ask: In which direction are predictions communicated between the hippocampus and neocortex? Superficial layers of the MTL cortex project to the hippocampus, while the deep layers receive feedback projections. Informational connectivity analyses revealed that communication between CA2/3 and PHC was specific to the deep layers of PHC.

Here, we explore the use of amphiphilic nanoporous polymer-infiltrated nanoparticle films that condense and release liquid water under isothermal and undersaturated conditions. By tuning the polymer fraction and nanoparticle size, we optimize condensation and droplet formation. As vapor pressure increases, voids fill with condensate, which subsequently exudes onto the surface as microscopic droplets.

In GLF-MINFLUX, membrane-permeable small-molecule fluorogenic dye with protein-induced “off/on” switching is gradually labeled, located, and bleached, enabling sequential positioning and tracking of individual proteins. GLF-MINFLUX reveals continuous microtubules with 2.6-nanometer localization precision, offering substantially improved precision (1.7-fold), acquisition (2.2-fold), and target density (3-fold) compared to conventional MINFLUX with Alexa Fluor 647. GLF-MINFLUX also enabled the three-dimensional localization of translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 proteins within mitochondrial clusters and dual-channel nanoscale imaging of endogenous neuronal microtubules and microfilaments. GLF-MINFLUX allowed live-cell single-protein tracking with 7.8-nanometer precision at ~200-microsecond temporal resolution, revealing distinct diffusion behaviors and rates between the basal membrane and filopodia.

In nonplume environments, carbonatite melts are progressively consumed until fully frozen as reduced carbon. Attachment of these materials to the cratonic keel further enhances craton stability.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, psychophysical experiments, and resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, our study demonstrated that events have an independent storage space within WM, named as event cache, with distinct neural correlates compared to object storage in WM. We found the cerebellar network to be the most essential network for event cache, with the left cerebellum Crus I being particularly involved in encoding and maintaining events.

Using this high-resolution resin, three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals (PhCs) were printed with two-photon lithography. After printing, the structures were heated to high temperatures in air to remove organic components and convert the remaining material into silica glass. 3D glass PhCs with periodicities as small as 260 nanometers were obtained after sintering at 650°C. The 3D glass PhCs exhibit ~100% reflectance in the visible range, surpassing the typical reflectances observed from similar structures in low–refractive index materials. The quality of PhCs achieved is observed in both electron microscopy and the excellent agreement with band structure calculations of idealized structures.",

The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.",

Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples, we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co-occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions. The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans, where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation. Conversely, in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans, plankton showed enrichment in non-phosphorus lipids, likely responding to warm temperature, with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump. In the subsurface of these regions, highly unsaturated lipids were enriched, suggesting phytoplankton adaptation to low light and contributing unsaturated fatty acids to tropical and subtropical ocean food webs.",

A limitation of neochromosomes is their low and unpredictable transmission rates due to trisomy. Here, we report that selecting for dicentric recombinants through male crosses uncovers stabilized chromosome 4 fission events, which split it into 4a-4b complementary chromosome pairs, where 4a carries a native centromere and 4b carries a synthetic one. The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated metabolism of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment leads to immune evasion and tumor progression. As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2\n            hi\n            TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (T\n            regs\n            ) to T\n            H\n            17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.",

    "abstract": "Coherently driven optical microresonators with Kerr nonlinearity have received intense interest since they host various nonlinear optical states including solitons and chaos. Recently, chaotic modulational instabilities (MIs)—a state far from equilibrium—have been exploited for parallel ranging and random number generation. Despite theoretical predictions suggesting unconventional wave statistics in chaotic MI, its rapidly varying temporal waveforms have prohibited direct experimental assessment. Here, we use a frequency-agile optical frequency comb to coherently interrogate the optical field within the microresonator in both temporal and spectral domains. In the chaotic regime, we observe transient events characterized by extremely high optical intensity, identified as rogue waves based on the long-tailed distribution of peak powers. Statistical analysis of many rogue wave events reveals their origin as pulse collisions. Our full-field measurement further unveils universal correlated photon transport that determines the collision process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Oxidative addition most commonly involves the addition of a substrate to a metal centre. This reaction is fundamental across synthetic chemistry and underpins numerous catalytic methods. In the textbook description of oxidative addition reactions, a net increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal occurs with simultaneous bond breaking at the substrate. The majority of known oxidative addition reactions, however, involve substrates bearing relatively electronegative elements (for example, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and halogens) and there has been little discussion of how addition processes may fundamentally change if substrates were constructed from more electropositive elements. Here we show that the zinc–zinc bonded complex, Cp*ZnZnCp* (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), which is isoelectronic with dihydrogen, undergoes facile addition to the metal (or semi-metal) centres of a series of main group carbene analogues based on silicon, aluminium, gallium or indium. Reactions proceed with complete breaking of the zinc–zinc bond and an increase in the coordination number of the central metal from two to four. Our analysis suggests that these addition processes are not oxidative, but rather there is likely a continuum of redox outcomes spanning oxidative, redox neutral and reductive. The addition of Cp*ZnZnCp* to silicon(II) provides the most compelling case for a prototypical reductive addition process.",

The formation of C–N bonds is reliably achieved through methods, such as reductive amination, N-alkylation and cross-coupling. Hydroamination, starting with alkenes, presents a valuable alternative for accessing organic compounds containing nitrogen, as alkenes are highly abundant. Here we present a method for the iron-catalysed radical hydroamidation of alkenes. To this end, we developed a radical amidation reagent that can be readily prepared on a large scale, facilitating the efficient transfer of the synthetically valuable cyanamide functionality across both activated and unactivated double bonds. The scope of the reaction is remarkably broad, demonstrating its applicability to the diastereoselective hydroamidation of complex terpene natural products. Importantly, the synthesis of 15N-labelled amines is possible using this strategy. Subsequent chemistry, converting the distinctive cyanamide functionality into other useful groups, further validates the value of the developed methodology.",

    "abstract": "Developing resilient and robust electrocatalysts devoid of noble metals is vital for facilitating the generation of O2/H2 from water electrolysis, particularly in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. Nickel‐based catalysts have attracted as part of global efforts to produce hydrogen from urea‐rich wastewater due to their high reaction rates and favorable long‐term stability. Two new mononuclear NiII‐embedded complexes, namely, [C26H38NiN4O4] (Complex 1) and [C24H32NiF2N4O2] (Complex 2), are explored as a bifunctional catalyst for the OER and UOR herein. Complexes 1 and 2 crystallize in triclinic and monoclinic with space group 1 (2) & P 21/c (14), respectively. The OER outcomes of Complex 1 exhibit excellent performance, featuring a lower overpotential of 220 mV and reduced Tafel slope value of 82 mV dec−1 at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH compared to Complex 2. Additionally, the results of UOR indicate that Complex 1 only requires 1.30 V potential to achieve the same current density which is significantly lower than other counterparts and most reported materials. Chronopotentiometry analysis reveals that Complex 1 is stable up to a longer period of 100 and 20 h in 1 M KOH and alkaline urea electrolyte, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis are typically developed by combining separate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts to form composites, often requiring complex synthesis methods. In this study, a simplified approach is presented by mechanical blending of BaSr2CoTiSbO9 (BSCTS), an OER catalyst, with BaSr2MnTiSbO9 (BSMTS), an ORR catalyst, to construct a composite bifunctional electrocatalyst. The density‐functional theory calculation supports superior ORR activity of BSMTS due to an uplifted Mn d‐band center than the Co d band and its proximity to the Fermi level, whereas the greater OER activity of BSCTS is due to the uplifted O 2p band center. While microstructural similarity of BSCTS and BSMTS facilitates efficient mixing for composite formation, the mechanical blending avoids intervention of complex synthesis procedures. The resulting bifunctional composite electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent performance with a bifunctional index of 0.72 V and a peak power density of 125 mW cm−2 when used as an air–cathode electrocatalyst in Zn–air battery (ZAB). This approach underscores the importance of mechanical blending of microstructurally compatible OER and ORR catalysts in designing practical bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs.",

    "abstract": "Functionalized quinones are crucial structural building blocks for synthesizing significant biologically active compounds. The selective catalytic oxidation of low‐valent oxygen precursors (including aromatic compounds, phenolic derivatives and hydroquinone analogues) has been widely recognized as one of the most economically and environmentally favorable approaches for producing functionalized quinones. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as versatile inorganic clusters, have attracted much attention in multidisciplinary fields, especially in catalysis, due to their adjustable structural configuration and acid‐base properties, excellent redox properties, as well as remarkable thermal stability, chemical stability and hydrolysis stability. As a pivotal branch, POM‐based heterogeneous catalytic systems not only preserve the inherent highly active sites of POMs, but also establish synergistic catalytic networks through the integration of hybrid components. This paves a new way for achieving material recyclability and green catalytic technology. This review presents a critical analysis of research advances in POM‐based heterogeneous catalysts for quinone synthesis over recent decades and systematically proposes optimization strategies from the perspective of material design principles and catalytic processes, aiming to offer molecular engineering theoretical support for the construction of a new generation of catalytic platform.",

    "abstract": "Corrosion is a challenge for the conservation of musical instruments when metal parts are exposed to organic materials of the instrument's body. In long‐term observations in the Norwegian Museum of Music, Ringve and Rockheim (Museums of Southern Trøndelag), local contact corrosion is documented on metal strings of plucked instruments when mounted close to cellulose nitrate (CN). The investigated strings are iron‐based alloys, in some cases covered with a tin coating. In the gas mixture emitted from CN, the presence of corrosive compounds, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carboxylic acids, is confirmed by an electrochemical NO2‐sensor and gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry. The corrosion product on the strings consists of iron oxide nitrate hydroxide hydrate, Fe2(NO3)O(OH)3(H2O), and goethite, α‐FeOOH, detected with X‐ray diffraction, Raman, and infrared spectroscopy. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, used to investigate the surface of tin‐coated corrosion products, showed the presence of adsorbed organic nitrogen. The formation of corrosion products is dominated by organic acids and moisture. The presence of nitrate in the corrosion product proves the involvement of nitrogen oxides in the corrosion mechanism. This analytical study highlights a dilemma for preserving material combinations in musical instruments and provides a basis for further research in conservation practice.",

However, existing catalytic systems often require harsh conditions or suffer from overoxidation issues, limiting their practical applicability. Herein, a highly efficient and selective catalytic system is reported for benzylic C─H oxidation of alkyl aromatics under exceptionally mild conditions, employing a synergistic combination of trivalent cobalt acetylacetonate [Co(acac)3] and N‐hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) in neutral media. This catalytic protocol achieves outstanding ketone yields up to 99% with >99% selectivity at 70 °C under atmospheric oxygen pressure. The system demonstrates remarkable substrate scope tolerance, accommodating various functional groups while maintaining excellent efficiency (up to 99% conversion and selectivity). Notably, the methodology has been successfully scaled to multigram production of acetophenone without compromising yield and selectivity. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including 18O2 isotopic labeling experiment, unequivocally establish a two‐step reaction pathway proceeding through a 1‐phenylethanol intermediate. This work provides significant advances in sustainable oxidation catalysis by combining operational simplicity with exceptional selectivity under mild conditions, offering promising potential for industrial implementation.",

In view of the simple structure and reactivity toward thiols, the DQ ring has the possibility to become a unique electrophile toward cysteine (Cys) for use in biochemical research. Herein, this possibility is investigated by evaluating the reactivity of a simple DQ salt toward amino acids and Cys‐containing peptides in neutral aqueous media. The results show that the DQ salt selectively forms adducts with free Cys and Cys residues in peptides. It is also demonstrated that the DQ salt effectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase, which contains a Cys residue in its active center. These results indicate that the DQ ring could serve as a new reactive group capable of Cys modification for biochemical and pharmaceutical applications.",

Understanding these materials is critical to developing conservation strategies, as their composition continues to change with industrial innovation and regulatory changes. This study presents the application of an analytical approach that integrates chemical mapping based on spectroscopic approaches together with analytical pyrolysis, chromatography, and mass spectrometry to investigate two key case studies and provide insights into the evolution of street art materials over the past 30 years. This comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of the composition and transformation of urban art materials over time, overcoming the limitations of individual methods and revealing both organic and inorganic materials. This combined approach represents the state of the art in the study of synthetic paints used in modern art and provides new insights into the evolution of the formulation of materials used by street artists.",

Herein, KI is incorporated into the BA2MA3Pb4I13 polycrystalline detector fabricated via the lamination method. The introduction of KI enhances both the crystallization quality and charge carrier transport capability of the perovskite polycrystalline film. By introducing K+ ions into the interstitial site of perovskite, the effective channel for ion migration is reduced, leading to increased ion activation energy, and then the ion migration in perovskite is effectively inhibited. Consequently, the prepared X‐ray detector exhibits improved stability, with a sensitivity of 6250 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 19.7 nGyair s−1.

The results revealed ellagitannin dyes in the black cords and lac and madder dye markers in one red cord. Some soluble redwoods (likely pernambuco, also known as brazilwood) were detected in the others, either on their own or mixed with weld. The preservation state varied among cords, correlating with the mordants; iron predominated in the black and red threads of Łaski’s Statute, contributing to their degradation, whereas the white cord exhibited higher sulfur content. In‐situ sampling using papers soaked with bathophenanthroline (Bphen) allowed detection of major elements in the fibers.

It is known that in the past, the pigment is collected in wooden reservoirs in which copper (Cu) compounds precipitated from drainage water during copper mining at Špania Dolina–Piesky and Ľubietová deposits, Slovakia. Microsamples of four polychrome wooden sculptures from the 16th‐17th centuries are examined. Posnjakite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·H2O) and malachite (Cu2(CO3)(OH)2) are most frequently detected by X‐ray powder microdiffraction. In rock samples from the mine site, brochantite (Cu4SO4(OH)6) and malachite are dominant, and in recent precipitates, only langite (Cu4SO4(OH)6·2H2O) is detected, remained in contact with leaking water. In the laboratory, the pigment is prepared by gradually enriching the starting CuSO4·5H2O solution with NaHCO3 in two series of experiments. The initial concentration of the reactants reflected the ratio of Cu2+: HCO3− = 1:1 found in the mine waters at the site, from which langite crystallizes. However, langite does not formed, while brochantite gradually transformed into posnjakite and subsequently malachite. The co‐occurrence of basic copper sulfates and carbonates and the characteristic grain morphology proved to be the main indicators of the pigment in artworks.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the long‐term stability of nanofluids (NFs) is challenging due to the several  issues. This study is the first to focus on both the stability and thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of biomass‐derived carbon nanosphere (CNS)‐based NFs. It enhances NF stability by utilizing CNSs synthesized from eight biowaste sources, each exhibiting varying dispersion capabilities (zeta potential, ZP values) ranging from ‐17 mV to ‐45.6 mV. For the first time, this research investigates how the ZP of biomass‐derived CNSs influences the TC and dynamic viscosity (V) of biomass‐based NFs. The NFs demonstrated high stability without the need for surfactants, achieving up to 111.8% enhancement in TC with high stability up to 40 days.  The influence of CNS concentration (0.01‐ 0,1 wt%) on TC was studied, revealing optimal enhancement at 0.1 wt%. The effect of ZP on thermal diffusivity is also studied. This work bridges the gap between research and industry, offering significant potential in the automotive sector. It provides a practical guide for future researchers to enhance their understanding of high‐efficiency coolants. Furthermore, this study aligns with seven Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing a cost‐effective waste‐to‐wealth approach that promotes sustainability and innovation.",

    "abstract": "Increasing biodiesel production poses a significant challenge in managing its primary byproduct, bioglycerol. Advancements in production techniques have markedly enhanced bioglycerol potential applications across various sectors, including as cosolvent in industrial formulations. In the context of eco‐sustainable formulation design, this study addresses the self‐aggregation of rhamnolipids, biosurfactants with a wide range of physico‐chemical and biological activities, in bioglycerol aqueous mixtures, studied by integrating surface tension and NMR self‐diffusion measurements. Preliminary analysis of the properties of water‐bioglycerol mixtures indicates that bioglycerol impurities (mainly potassium acetate) have only a small effect on surface tension and no discernible effect on bulk properties such as density, viscosity and refractive index. The aggregation of rhamnolipids is unaffected by bioglycerol at concentrations up to 40‐50 wt%. At higher cosolvent levels, the cmc increases and the micelle dimension micellar size decreases, an indirect effect of the decreasing polarity of the medium. These results provide the basic knowledge to promote the exploration of rhamnolipids and bioglycerol as valuable ingredients in formulations for various applications.",

    "abstract": "This study uses a membrane‐less reactor to explore the bioelectrochemical remediation of real contaminated groundwater from chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) and nitrates. The research focuses on testing a column‐type bioelectrochemical reactor to stimulate in‐situ degradation of contaminants through the supply of electrons by a graphite granules biocathode. After a preliminary laboratory characterization and operation with a synthetic feeding solution, a field test was conducted in a real contaminated site, where the reactor demonstrated effective degradation of CAHs and inorganic anions. Notably, the cathodic potential promoted the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated species. Simultaneously, nitrate reduction, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis occurred, influencing the overall coulombic efficiency of the process. The use of real groundwater, compared to the synthetic medium, significantly decreased the coulombic efficiency of reductive dechlorination, dropping from 2.43% to 0.01%. Concentration profiles along the bioelectrochemical reactor allowed for a deeper description of the reductive dechlorination rate at different flow rates as well as increased knowledge about reduction and oxidation mechanisms. Scaling up the technology presents several challenges, including the optimization of coulombic efficiency and the management of competing microbial metabolisms. The study provides a valuable contribution towards advancing bioelectrochemical technologies for bioremediation of complex contaminated sites.",

This study reports the design and synthesis of dopant‐free pyrazine‐based HTMs. PS1 features a D–A–D type structure with pyrazine as the acceptor and 4,4′‐dimethoxy triphenylamine (4,4′‐OMe‐TPA) as the donor, while PS2 adopts a D–π–A–π–D configuration with an additional thiophene unit as π‐spacer along with 4,4′‐OMe‐TPA as donor. Both compounds are synthesized through a simple two‐step synthetic procedure. These HTMs are subjected to structural, photophysical, electrochemical, theoretical, and photoelectrochemical studies with an emphasis on evaluation of structure–property relationships. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the electronic distribution, optimized molecular structure, and frontier molecular orbitals. Their performance in PVSCs is systematically evaluated without adding dopants. PS2 exhibits superior photoluminescence quenching compared to PS1, indicating more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite layer. Notably, PS2 achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%, surpassing the performance of PS1 (PCE of 10.15%). These findings highlight the potential of adjusting the electron‐deficient core and π‐bridge units as an effective strategy to optimize the properties of HTMs and improve their performance in PVSC applications.",

    "abstract": "The development of environmentally friendly oxidants has emerged as a prominent topic in the fields of green chemistry and chemical engineering. This review comprehensively examines the sustainable production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and its applications in green chemical synthesis. H2O2, known as a green oxidant, is generated through the 2e− ORR pathway using various catalysts, including noble metals, carbon‐based materials, single‐atom catalysts, and transition metal oxides. This method offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional H2O2 production, enabling in‐situ synthesis without organic waste. The review highlights the direct role of H2O2 in promoting chemical transformations, such as the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides and alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Additionally, it explores the indirect application of H2O2 through its decomposition into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in Fenton reactions, which drive selective oxidation and degradation processes. These applications demonstrate the versatility of H2O2 in advancing green chemistry by facilitating eco‐friendly oxidation reactions and pollutant degradation. Future work will focus on improving catalyst stability and scalability for industrial use, further enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of H2O2‐based chemical processes.",

This research focuses on murals from the churches of Marcapata and Canincunca in the Cuzco region. Microsamples from these murals were analyzed using micro‐invasive techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy‐dispersive spectroscopy (SEM‐EDS), and Raman microspectroscopy. The study revealed a preparation layer of gypsum/anhydrite on adobe walls and a simple yet diverse palette of pigments. Red pigments included hematite (Fe₂O₃) and organic carmine dye, while green hues featured copper‐based pigments such as antlerite (Cu₃SO₄(OH)₃) and posnjakite (Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆·H₂O), identified here for the first time as a major component in Andean mural paintings. Blue tones were achieved using indigo and smalt, a cobalt‐containing glass pigment whose presence is still scarcely documented in Peruvian murals. These findings deepen our understanding of colonial pigment selection, preparation practices, and their deterioration mechanisms, contributing to sustainable conservation strategies. This study highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing knowledge of Hispanic‐American colonial art and its preservation as a vital component of cultural heritage.",

The knowledge obtained can be useful for leaching minerals with disseminated native platinum in refractory minerals such as silicates of which there are large quantities in nature but are not processed due to their great refractoriness. The results show that increasing the temperature and the HClO4 concentration increases the leaching rate. Interestingly, for each HClO4 concentration, an H2O2/HClO4 = 2.5 ratio exists that optimises the leaching kinetics. The best operating conditions were approximately 70 °C, [HClO4] 3M, and [H2O2] 7.2 M. From kinetic analysis, it was concluded that the leaching process is governed by a mixed control stage (diffusion in the boundary layer and surface chemical reaction). Also, it was proposed that the leaching process mechanism is supported by fundamental thermodynamic and experimental results, highlighting the importance of chlorine gas for this novel extraction method that reaches elevated recoveries. This process is also interesting because the chemical system can potentially weaken the crystallographic structure of silicates (very important), increasing the feasibility of extracting the partially not liberated precious metals.",

Since the discovery of catalytic reactivities in Au‐based materials, including nanoparticles, molecular complexes, and nanoclusters (AuNCs), mechanistic insights into the interaction and reductive activation of O2 by Au have been pursued by researchers. However, the atomic level understanding of the reaction mechanism remains elusive compared with that for other widely explored transition metalO2 systems. This paper briefly discusses recent progress in clarifying the reaction mechanisms of Au‐O2 chemistry for homogeneous molecular Au complexes and atomically precise AuNCs. We introduce our research on (1) O2‐activation by Au complexes without the distinct formation of conventional metal‐hydride species, and (2) the application of kinetic analyses to the reaction of thiolate‐protected AuNCs with O2 to quantify parameters like O2‐binding constants on the Au surface. These findings help elucidate both the Au‐O2 interaction and reductive activation of O2, which are essential in catalytic systems using O2 as a terminal oxidant that can contribute to the developments of eco‐friendly oxidation Au‐based catalysts with high performance.",

    "abstract": "As the sole commercial polycarbonate derived from CO2, poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) is still hindered by poor thermal stability and a low glass transition temperature. Herein, first, the terpolymerization of CO2, propylene oxide (PO), and epichlorohydrin (ECH) to synthesize PPC‐ECH terpolymers via one‐pot and metal‐free method using multinuclear organoboron catalysts is reported. The PPC‐ECH terpolymers with well‐rounded properties can be easily synthesized by adjusting reaction conditions, monomer ratios, catalyst types, and loading. The molecular weight of the PPC‐ECH terpolymer can reach up to 59.4 kg mol−1, which is the highest known. Notably, the synthesized PPC‐ECH exhibits outstanding barrier performance with oxygen permeability as low as 1.31 cm3 mm (m2 day)−1 and water vapor permeability as low as 0.016 g mm (m2 day)−1, significantly lower than those of pure PPC or other common packaging materials. Importantly, the introduction of a small amount of ECH not only preserves the biodegradability of polycarbonate but also markedly enhances its mechanical properties, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and flame retardancy, offering promising prospects for application in packaging materials.",

To this purpose we examine an acrylic painting on raw canvas, Tela by Giorgio Griffa (1973), and the model samples purposely prepared together with the painter. Felt‐tip marker vandalic act, by which the painting was disfigured, is analyzed as well. The analytical approach entails combination of non‐invasive spectroscopic techniques to study the molecular composition and changes induced by artificial ageing in model samples. The results are correlated with those obtained on the painting to support the development of a suitable conservation treatment to remove the vandalic act.",

This study employs nontargeted metabolomics to provide a comprehensive chemical profile of a single P. lactiflora plant using Orbitrap high‐resolution, accurate‐mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry. A total of 214 compounds are identified, including 45 previously unreported metabolites. These compounds, spanning classes such as glycosides, flavonoids, organic acids, and triterpenes, are detected across its seven parts (leaf, petiole, stem, flower, root, xylem in root, cortex in root), with the root showing the highest chemical diversity. Six root samples collected from traditional habitats are also analyzed to propose their quality markers. From 37 compounds common to all root samples, 8 compounds are proposed as potential quality markers based on their widespread presence and abundance across traditional growing regions. This research not only enriches the chemical understanding of P. lactiflora but also sets the foundation for future studies on its medicinal potential and quality control in pharmaceutical applications.",

The synthesis process involves the sequential coating of magnetite nanoparticles with tetraethylorthosilicate (SiO2), 3‐chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTES), and 3,5‐diamino‐1,2,4‐triazole (DAT). The MNPs synthesized at each stage are analyzed using high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis (EDX), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (DT/TGA) to confirm the successful coating of the desired adsorbent. Fe3O4@SiO2@CPTES@DAT MNPs selectively recover Au(III) ions under optimum conditions of pH = 2, 10 mg adsorbent amount, and 20 min contact time, and quantification of Au(III) ions is carried out by inductively coupled plasma‐optical emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES). The method's suitability to adsorption isotherm and kinetic models is examined and found to be more compatible with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic model. Relative standard deviation, limit of detection, and limit of quantification are calculated as 2.51%, 0.019, and 0.065 μg L−1, respectively, as analytical performance parameters.

In this study, we identify the sterol metabolism‐related genes, which encode the aldolases (Ltp2 and Thl) and carboxylic acid reductases (CAR) in Mycolicibacterium neoaurum NRRL B‐3805 (B3805), by analysis of the metabolites from phytosterols biotransformation. Based on these results, a genetically modified strain is constructed by disrupting the kstD, ltp2, and hsd4A genes and overexpressing the aldolase gene (thl) in the strain B3805. This recombinant strain (B3805V) is able to transform 5 g L−1 phytosterols to 2.0 g L−1 4‐HBC without detectable AD by‐product. Additionally, by disrupting the ltp2 and car genes, a strain (strain B3805VI) is obtained to transform phytosterols to PDCE with 1.44 g L−1 titer. The PDCE concentration is further increased by about 42% to 2.1 g L−1 without 4‐HBC by‐product by deleting thl gene (strain B3805VII). On the preparative scale, the strain B3805VII transforms 10 g L−1 of phytosterols into PDCE with 5.1 g L−1. This study presents one‐step bioproduction of pharmaceutically important 4‐HBC and PDCE with high yield and purity from bio‐renewable phytosterols, which are readily available as a by‐product from the plant oil industry.",

IFT is measured using the spinning drop tensiometer across a temperature range of 25–40 °C, while critical micelle concentrations (CMC) are determined via conductometric methods. Thermodynamic parameters of micellization are calculated from temperature‐dependent CMC data. The results show that micellization is an entropy‐driven process for all tested surfactants.

Specifically, the LOD for GSH using the BPh‐TPE‐Cu2+ complex is 457 nM. Practical applicability is confirmed via visual color changes on filter paper and in water samples. These findings highlight the potential of these TPE derivatives for detecting copper, mercury, silver ions, and GSH in environmental water. Additionally, Al/organic layer/p‐Si heterojunction devices incorporating spin‐coated TPE layers are fabricated. Their electrical behaviors are analyzed through current‐voltage and current‐time measurements under varying light conditions. Transient photocurrent analysis indicates strong photoresponse, supporting their suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.",

    "abstract": "Biodegradable polymers are of great interest in addressing the current pollution problem caused by synthetic petroleum‐based polymers. It is well known that various microorganisms synthesize and store high‐molecular‐weight polyhydroxyalkanoates in their cytoplasm as water‐insoluble inclusions. In this study, the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii N‐15 strain is used for bioplastic production. The optimal polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) yield (62% of biomass, 23.6 g L−1 dry cells) is achieved by cultivating the bacteria in Burke's medium with molasses as a carbon source (5 wt.%) at 30 °C, 220 rpm, for 50 h. The resulting polymer was characterized using thin‐layer chromatography, UV‐Vis, fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and X‐ray diffraction. The results confirmed that the polymer is PHB with a purity of 98.9%, a molecular weight of 1.2 MDa, a crystallinity of 73%, a melting point of 179 °C, a decomposition temperature of 275 °C, a density of 1.22 g cm−3, a melt flow index of 10 g 10 min−1, a Shore hardness of 82, a tensile strength of 30 MPa, and a relative elongation at break of 4.5%. Thus, a bioplastic with properties suitable for practical applications is successfully obtained using molasses—a byproduct of sugar production.",

    "abstract": "Perchlorate ions (ClO4−) are prevalent contaminants in the surface, and drinking water that disrupt thyroid function by competitively inhibiting the sodium‐iodide symporter (NIS), posing significant health risks. Here, fluorescence‐based logic gates have been constructed by leveraging the binding interactions between a hemicyanine dye, 4‐[4‐(dimethylamino)‐styryl]‐1‐docosylpyridinium bromide (DASPC22) and β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) that could be useful to know whether ClO4− ions in water are within the toxicity range or not. In aqueous media, DASPC22 forms nonfluorescent H‐aggregates, but fluorescence is enhanced upon forming host‐guest inclusion complexes with β‐CD. At low ClO4− ions concentrations, fluorescence intensity further increases due to enhanced complex stability through hydrogen bonding. ONIOM‐based quantum chemical calculations have supported this phenomenon. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of DASPC22 in the presence of β‐CD and a low concentration of ClO4− ions leads to the construction of a YES logic gate that would enable one to quantify ClO4− ions’ toxicity range in water. Dual‐input‐single‐output AND and INHIBIT logic gates with low and high concentrations of ClO4− ions, respectively, have also been constructed. The present system could be useful in addressing safety concerns related to perchlorate contamination of water.",

Chromatography and magnetic resonance assessed the purity, identity, and structural features of the synthesized compounds, ensuring their suitability for the said applications. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction was exploited for structure solution of three of them, revealing that the introduction of specific substituents induces changes in both the molecular structure and the crystal packing, driven by a balance between π‐stacking and weak nonbonding contacts. Small changes in the pyridine substituents can induce conformational changes in the opposite benzyl ring orientation, spanning from a planar to a perpendicular orientation. The structural analysis, including Hirshfeld surfaces and energetic frameworks calculations, clarified intermolecular interactions contributing to a better understanding of the solid state behavior of the title compounds.",

Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising nonprecious catalyst for the ORR. Unfortunately, FePc with plane‐symmetric Fe‐N4 site usually exhibits an unsatisfactory ORR activity due to its poor O2 adsorption and activation. In this work, Chlorine‐coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl‐FePc) has been studied as a catalyst for the electrochemical ORR. Coordination of iron phthalocyanine with chlorine introduces additional active sites for ORR, improving its catalytic activity. The chlorine atoms enhance the electron transfer process and facilitate the ORR validated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The obtained catalyst exhibits fast kinetics for O2 adsorption and activation with an ultralow Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 and a remarkable half‐wave potential of 0.80 V.

In this article, we report the synthesis of a series of azomethine‐pyrazole derivatives bearing a para‐substituted azo‐phenyl ring. These compounds were evaluated as antifungal agents against Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans strains. Compound ClAzoNH, substituted by chloride, displayed the highest toxicity on Candida albicans, with an MIC50 value of 2.08 μg/mL, while methoxy‐substituted MeOAzoNH showed moderate inhibitory activity. The unsubstituted AzoNH compound exhibited the highest activity towards Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei strains.

    "abstract": "Invasive alien vegetation brought about by various human activities has grown to be a significant threat to the ecosystem and its diversity; therefore, control strategies to combat this threat are being explored. This review aims to investigate the prospect of using biochar specifically from alien vegetation as a support material for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell electrocatalyst, highlighting the need to move to green energy and invest in Eco conservation. The use of biochar derived from alien vegetation as carbon support for the platinum (Pt) electrocatalyst for PEM fuel cells is an interesting field that is slowly gaining momentum. Biochar has the potential to be used as a carbon support due to its high specific surface, area, and intrinsic property needed for an electrocatalyst support. The current widely used electrocatalyst, which is Pt supported on carbon black, has shown to suffer from corrosion which weakens the bond between the support and the Pt nanoparticles, leading to instability and resistance; therefore, alternative supports are needed also to decrease the Pt loading as it is expensive. The focus of this review is on the benefits and prospects of these cheap green resources in increasing efforts to conserve the environment.",

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) are obtained on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in acetonitrile (MeCN) and 0.1 mol L−1 n‐Bu4NPF6 versus Ag|AgCl|Cl−, to evaluate cathodic and anodic behavior and chemical processes. The CVs of LQB‐109 display two irreversible cathodic waves at −2.04 V and − 2.19V, related to a four‐electron reduction to hydroxylamine. Two anodic waves appeared at +1.32 V and +1.53 V. The first electron uptake for LQB‐569 occurs in the nitroaromatic group, followed by reductions to give a more electrophilic nitroso, prone to dimerizing and forming reducible azoxy derivatives, along with nitrone reduction, in a 10‐electron total process. One irreversible anodic wave at +1.45 V appears, related to the nitrone oxidation. The electrochemical oxidation profile can be correlated to antioxidant capacity (AO). The ability to scavenge 2,2‐diphenil‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)• radicals (% radical scavenging activity) and reduce ferric complexes (ferric‐reducing antioxidant power) were used to assess. LQB‐569 showed low AO, due to the presence of the electron‐withdrawing group, reflecting the oxidative part of the CVs.",

The ligand synthesis is straight forward and accomplished in two steps. Detailed studies show that the implementation of the functional groups in the [FeFe]‐hydrogenase mimic has marginal impact on the structural, thermodynamic properties, and catalytic performance in the electrochemical proton reduction reaction. However, the modification opens the way for a wide variety of functionalization in the ligand backbone, e.g., for applications in photo/electrocatalysis. Electrochemical investigations reveal that initial two electron reductions are followed by protonation by acetic acid forming an asymmetric diironhydride species. Further reduction of the hydride species and protonation leads to H2 formation. Utilizing foot of the wave analysis, a reaction rate of 2 × 108 s−1 m−1 for the H2 evolution step consisting of the reaction of the metal hydride species and the external acid has been determined. However, catalysis is limited by the formation of the hydride at a rate constant of about 4 × 104 s−1 m−1.",

    "abstract": "The development of inherently flexible battery electrodes remains a key challenge for modern wearable electronics. Despite the advancement of flexible Lithium‐ion (Li+) batteries, achieving full adaptability requires redesigning individual battery components. Conventional graphite electrodes are used in Li+ batteries but remain rigid and brittle, limiting applications in flexible energy storage. Here, this limitation is addressed by integrating nanocellulose (NCF), a nanoscale biopolymer, with graphite (G), to yield an intrinsically flexible electrode platform. Five NCF/G battery electrode compositions with increasing NCF content (40–70 wt%) are fabricated via a straightforward aqueous route and are evaluated in Li+ half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li+ and NCF surface groups suggesting Li+ diffusion through nanochannels. A perspective on the material‐driven reshaping of flexible NCF/G battery electrodes is provided, by investigating the contribution of NCF to charge storage mechanisms and to mechanical resilience. This study contributes to the development of battery electrodes that can be tailored to energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics applications, and towards battery market diversification.",

    "abstract": "The electroreduction of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers promising opportunities for the synthesis of valuable chemical precursors. However, achieving high selectivity in this process remains challenging due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved. Here, this study employs different electrochemical techniques to analyze each of the HMF electroreduction pathways. These findings demonstrate that the primary products of HMF electroreduction are 2,5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 5‐methylfurfural alcohol (MFA), with lower formation of 5‐methylfurfural (5‐MF) and 2,5‐dimethylfuran. This study identifies a significant competition between hydrogen evolution reaction and the reduction of HMF and 5‐MF that affect the faradaic efficiencies of the organic transformation. In contrast, BHMF and MFA display a reduced reactivity, behaving as terminal molecules. Through impedance analysis, it is possible to follow the reaction pathways by associating each reaction step with the changes observed in charge transfer and accumulation phenomena. These are key parameters for understanding the reaction mechanisms in the system as they allow to distinguish between adsorption, absorption and reaction of the organic molecules onto the electrode surface. This approach helps to accurately select the optimal potential for the reduction reactions. The results obtained in this study facilitate the design of efficient and selective electrocatalytic systems for biomass conversion.",

SSEs benefit from h‐BN's ability to suppress dendrites, reinforce mechanical strength, and optimize interfacial compatibility, making it a key enabler for next‐generation battery technologies.

    "abstract": "Platinum group metal‐free (PGM‐free) catalysts are showing increasing performance and durability and are considered as viable candidates for replacing precious metal‐based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Due to the low intrinsic activity and low active site density, large quantities of the PGM‐free catalysts are needed to obtain high performance. Consequently, the resulting high catalyst loadings induce several interesting and opposing phenomena, namely, lower ORR kinetic losses due to an increase in the number of active sites and much higher mass and charge transport losses. In this work, Fourier‐transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are employed to systematically deconvolute the gains and losses to the activity due to the high loading of PGM‐free catalysts and relate the underlying processes to the observed fuel cell performance. EIS is analyzed via extraction of the distribution of relaxation times, obtaining a model‐free analysis of the physical processes in the cell. Combined with FTacV measurements, the obtained catalyst loading optimum from a mechanistic point of view is explained. The combined use of advanced alternating current techniques for the analysis of operating fuel cells is an important step toward the rational design of the catalyst layer.",

Herein, the electrochemical synthesis of a ten‐membered cyclic azobenzene, 6,7‐dihydrodibenzo[e,i][1,4,7,8]dioxadiazecine (DDEI), is reported through the reduction of 1,2‐bis(2‐nitrophenoxy)ethane (BNPOE) in the presence of CO2. The reduction mechanism, involving an irreversible eight‐electron process and CO2 capture, is elucidated using in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) spectroelectrochemistry, complemented by 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry analyzes. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that DDEI undergoes highly efficient trans‐to‐cis isomerization under green light (500 nm) irradiation, achieving a remarkable yield of 97%, with both isomers exhibiting excellent thermal stability. In contrast to 8‐ and 9‐membered cyclic azobenzenes and in line with conventional linear azobenzenes, the trans configuration of DDEI is more stable than the cis configuration. This combination of synthetic accessibility and superior photophysical properties makes DDEI a promising candidate for various applications, including those in living systems.",

    "abstract": "Catalyst dissolution is one of the key challenges in achieving long‐term performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with low iridium loading. However, most of the dissolved catalyst remains in the catalyst‐coated membrane, inaccessible for operando quantification. While simpler aqueous model systems improve mechanistic understanding, dissolution rates are significantly overestimated compared to the device level. To bridge this gap, herein, an electrochemical half‐cell setup that mimics the anode catalyst layer environment to enable operation at relevant current densities (>1 ) is presented. Dissolved catalyst species transported through the porous transport layer or through the membrane are separately detected operando by coupling to inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate a strong preference for the transport of dissolved iridium through the membrane (99.9%) and a decrease in catalyst stability by factor 10 at high current densities. Discrepancies with so far reported findings from full‐cell and half‐cell experiments highlight a lack of understanding of catalyst dissolution and the transportation of dissolved species in different systems. The presented method offers unique insights which will help to study and optimize catalyst dissolution by means of various manufacturing and operation parameters to ultimately improve the stability of catalyst layers for water electrolysis.",

Herein, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with the [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic [Fe2(μ‐pdt)(CO)6, 1, where pdt = propane‐1,3‐dithiolate] in acetonitrile is reported. In the presence of the weak acid, methanol (MeOH), 1 reduces CO2 to both CO (Faradaic Efficiency maximum [FEmax] of 16 ± 6%) and HCOO− (FEmax = 20%) and produces H2 (FEmax = 56 ± 4%). Without added MeOH, 1 reacts with adventitious water to form H2 (FEmax = 85 ± 1%), HCOO− (FEmax = 7.8%), and CO (FEmax = 7 ± 3%) with CO32− being detected by infrared spectroscopy.  Product formation is potential dependent: more negative potentials increases selectivity for HCOO− over CO. The first reduction of 1 forms a pdt‐bridged dimer, 2. However, the reduction of 2 at the potentials required for electrochemical CO2 reduction leads to two new species. Using density functional theory, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR‐SEC), these structures are identified to be [Fe(CO)4]2− (3) and a trinuclear Fe3 species (4). While these species can reduce CO2 to CO and HCOO−, the predominant formation of H2 reveals kinetic issues in  CO2 reduction. The work offers to consider alternate competing mechanistic pathways and explains the lack of product selectivity when using hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO−.",

    "abstract": "Alkaline water electrolysis (AWS) is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the low performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes leads to high energy consumption. Enhancing OER efficiency is essential for reducing energy barriers and improving system performance. In this study, it develops a composite catalyst of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ and IrO2 (PBSCF‐Ir), with a surface area of 18.68 m2g−1. The PBSCF‐Ir composite exhibits a low overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and stability over 300 h. In water splitting tests, it achieves a lower cell voltage (1.95 V at 500 mA cm−2) compared to pure IrO2. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a 1 eV blueshift in Co 2p energy levels, indicating modified electronic structures. Density functional theory calculations show that IrO2 shifts the d‐band centers of Co and Fe, enhancing electrophilicity, OH− affinity, and OER activity. This study highlights the PBSCF‐Ir composite as an efficient and durable catalyst for AWS, thereby addressing the need for sustainable hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "The strong binding energy of CO on iron surfaces has rendered Fe electrodes as poor electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) catalysts, predominantly producing hydrogen. Recent studies on tuning the microenvironment near the catalyst surfaces by tuning the local electric field in nonaqueous environments have been shown to promote eCO2R by facilitating the CO2 activation step. Herein, the use of tetraethylammonium (TEA) cation to tune the electric field on Fe surfaces, such that it leads to the formation of industrially relevant oxalates (C2 products), is reported. At optimal cation concentrations, the developed eCO2R system achieves 25 mA cm−2 of current density and Faradaic Efficiencies up to 75% toward oxalate. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of surface‐adsorbed TEA cations and other species on the Fe surfaces, leading to the well‐known outer‐sphere mechanism of electron transfer during eCO2R. The employment of Fe, along with microenvironment tuning, not only demonstrates high catalytic performance but also provides a safer and more sustainable alternative to toxic catalysts such as Pb that dominate the nonaqueous eCO2R literature. These findings pave the way for further optimization and scale‐up of the process, offering a viable route for sustainable chemical production and CO2 mitigation.",

    "abstract": "With global energy demand increasing alongside population growth, the importance of efficient, clean energy conversion systems like fuel cells and batteries intensifies. Fuel cells are recognized for their ability to generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen, with water as the only byproduct, and can also function in reverse as energy storage systems by producing hydrogen. Batteries chemically store energy and enable zero‐carbon emissions through their closed‐loop functionality. As demand grows, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is more actively used for investigating various electrochemical and physicochemical properties within electrochemical systems. Furthermore, EIS can serve as an in situ analysis method during operation, making it even more impactful in the near future. This article reviews the studies and applications of EIS, an advanced technique that provides insights into the electrochemical reaction at the interfaces and charge transfer processes within these systems. In addition, it provides an overview of the electrochemical principles governing these technologies, with a focus on the distinct roles and mechanisms of their components. The review offers a deeper understanding of EIS applications for studying electrochemical performance and physicochemical properties while also covering advancements in state‐of‐the‐art technologies for fuel cells, electrolyzers, and batteries.",

Herein, a two‐step study is undertaken to investigate and optimize hydrophobic modification of electrodeposited Cu2O nanomaterial electrodes. First, the electrochemical deposition potentials are altered in equivalent electrolyte conditions, which is found to alter the size of the deposited nanomaterials and the corresponding electrode surface roughness. Second, the electrodes are soaked in thiol‐containing solutions containing a range of both aromatic and aliphatic thiols to achieve chemically modified self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the electrode surfaces. The surface and morphological properties of the electrodeposited electrodes are assessed with scanning electron microscopy, laser confocal, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Confocal and AFM also allow the determination of the surface roughness of the electrodes at both the microscale and the nanoscale. The presence of SAM‐modification is determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angles are also measured on the nonthiol‐modified and thiol‐modified electrodes, and the contact angle is found to increase from 70°–100° to 130°–140°, close to superhydrophobic levels of contact angles.",

    "abstract": "Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), widely used in electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications, are increasingly expected to deliver higher energy densities and stable performance over a wide temperature range, posing stringent challenges for advanced electrolyte design. However, achieving these properties remains challenging with currently commercialized ethylene carbonate (EC)‐based electrolytes. Herein, a propylene carbonate (PC)‐based electrolyte system is reported, employing hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as synergistic additives. Specifically, HFB facilitates compatibility with graphite anodes through selective interfacial adsorption, while the decomposition of FEC stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), mitigating the formation of high‐impedance interfaces. This tailored electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity, excellent oxidative stability, and broad temperature tolerance. When validated at 4.5 V, high‐loading NCM811/graphite cells achieve nearly full capacity over 100 cycles at low temperatures (−20 °C), with pouch cells retaining 80% of their capacity after 470 cycles. These findings underscore the effectiveness of strategic additive engineering in advancing the development of PC‐based electrolytes for practical LIBs.",

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with their unique structural tunability, redox properties, and high surface area have emerged as promising candidates for the OER process. In this work, a presentation on how linker functionalization in rather unexplored manganese‐based MOFs leads to enhanced OER activity is given. A series of manganese‐based MOFs in rarely reported MIL‐88B structure (Mn‐MIL‐88‐X) is synthesized using functionalized linkers [X = NH2, NO2, Br]. The objective is to modulate the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of the MOFs leading to enhanced OER activity. Among functionalized MOFs, Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 shows remarkable performance, requiring only 260 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1. The improvement in OER activity of Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 is ascribed to the higher oxidation states of manganese (Mn3+/Mn4+) and the presence of the amino group (‐NH2) as confirmed through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work paves the way for the designing and exploring of mixed‐valence state metal‐based MOFs as advanced electrode materials for electrocatalysis.",

To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the OCO angles and elongate the CO bonds, transforming CO2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual‐V and dual‐Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO2, leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu‐based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO2 utilization.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, visible‐light‐driven reactions have emerged as a powerful tool in organic synthesis. Unlike traditional photoredox reactions that require additional catalysts or photosensitizers, electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complex‐mediated photochemistry offers a simpler and more cost‐effective approach to achieving diverse radical transformations without the need for noble catalysts. Among these, the use of boron‐containing compounds as electron donors or acceptors in EDA complexes has garnered significant attention due to their unique properties. This review highlights recent advances in visible‐light‐induced EDA complex‐mediated transformations involving boron‐containing compounds, focusing on their applications in constructing CC and CB bonds and elucidating the underlying reaction mechanisms.",

Most donor–acceptor‐type luminescent systems show solvent‐polarity sensitivity, which limits their applications. Herein, three alternate π‐conjugated biphenyl/terphenyl substituents are attached to the TTM unit. Results reveal that connection modes and types of benzene ring derivatives lead to distinct charge transfer (CT) and locally excited state hybrid emitters due to the differences in conjugation degree. All three radicals exhibit polarity‐insensitive red emission (626–690 nm), and their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) increase with solvent polarity. Specifically, linear‐conjugated TTM‐DPh has higher photostability but lower PLQY, while nonlinear‐conjugated TTM‐3DPh and TTM‐TPh have nearly 10‐fold higher PLQYs. The photophysical studies suggest that the conjugation degree and hybridization level between CT and ground states account for these properties.",

Herein, the successful synthesis of ≈2.6 nm AuPt alloy nanoparticles supported on MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures via in situ transformation of α‐MnO2 is reported. Selective aerobic photocatalytic glycerol oxidation toward value‐added C3 products has been achieved with AM 1.5G light irradiation under ambient conditions on these as synthesized 1 wt% AuPt/MnO2‐Mn3O4, which displays 2.3 and 6.5 times enhancement compared to that of AuPt/Mn3O4 and AuPt/MnO2. A 74% overall C3 product selectivity (60% in terms of glyceric acid) has been achieved at 75% glycerol conversion after 4 h of photocatalytic reaction. Investigation results reveal that the formation of MnO2‐Mn3O4 heterostructures combines the local photothermal heating (primarily on MnO2) synergistically with the photochemical catalysis (on Mn3O4), thus achieving enhanced photocatalytic glycerol oxidation. This study may provide guidance for future catalyst design, where photon‐driven photocatalysis with phonon‐driven photothermal effect can be seamlessly integrated to achieve maximal solar energy utilization and high photocatalytic efficiency.",

Among photochemical techniques, photopolymerization stands out as a rapid, controlled, and eco‐friendly approach, making it particularly suitable for applications like 3D printing. This research in two‐photon‐induced photopolymerization for 3D microfabrication led to groundbreaking performance, thanks to the use of custom π‐extended molecular architectures as photoinitiators. Building on these results, a photoactivable initiation system for photoinduced‐atom transfer radical polymerization (photoATRP) is now reported using a similar π‐extended photoinitiator. Through comprehensive optimization, we successfully created a functional multicomponent photoinitiating system, with its detailed mechanism thoroughly established in solution. By covalently attaching alkyl halides to glass surfaces, we were able to implement the surface‐induced photo‐ATRP technique to create customized brush polymer architectures. This work not only advances the understanding of photoATRP mechanisms but also introduces new strategies for functional surface engineering, with potential applications in two‐photon‐induced surface modification of 3D/4D structures via photoATRP.",

It is very favorable for the devices working at high temperature. And this phenomenon may benefit from the high energy transfer efficiency at higher temperatures.

Switches based on 2‐pyridyl‐ or 2‐pyridylmethyl‐containing N‐components exhibit strong fluorescence in their protonated Z‐configurations, compared to their phenyl/benzyl counterparts. This behavior can be attributed to variations in intramolecular charge transfer or excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer effects.

    "abstract": "Polymethine cyanine dyes have a heterocyclic structure containing nitrogen at both ends of the polymethine chain. They have been extensively investigated in material sciences for numerous applications. The synthesis of cyanine dyes with various functional groups on the methine chain has attracted significant attention because it significantly alters the properties of the dye. However, few synthetic methods have been reported for directly introducing groups onto the methine chains of cyanine dyes. Ketone functional groups are essential in synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials chemistry. However, there are no reports on the direct introduction of ketone groups into cyanine dyes. Trifluoroacetylation is performed on the methine chains of polymethine cyanine dyes. This is achieved by directly using anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid to synthesize trifluoroacetylated trimethine, pentamethine, and heptamethine cyanine dyes in good yields. Single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis is performed to determine the substitution positions in the synthesized dyes. The results reveal that trifluoroacetylation of the methine chain shortens the maximum absorption wavelength and decreases the molar absorption coefficient in dichloromethane solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) film compared to an unsubstituted cyanine dye, and decreases the fluorescence quantum yield. This study highlights the unique properties of trifluoroacetylated polymethine cyanine dyes.",

Herein, bismuth manganate (BMO) is investigated as a photoanode absorber material for PEC. BMO thin films are prepared by a sol–gel method with and without a bismuth oxide (BO) overlayer. It is found that the BO overlayer forms BO nanoislands after annealing. Under visible light illumination, BMO with BO nanoislands results in a nearly tenfold increase of the current density compared to pristine BMO at the same applied potential. This increased performance is related to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and in the amount of recombinations based on the formation of a favorable heterojunction between BMO and BO. The application of overlayers on electrode materials in combination with suitable band alignment is an effective strategy to improve the performance of PEC electrodes.",

Photophysical studies, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, reveal strong electronic communication between the porphyrin core and the fullerene unit, corroborated by theoretical calculations demonstrating efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Electrochemical measurements, supported by theoretical insights, confirm that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) energy levels of the C60‐3PV‐ZnP‐2DoH‐COOH dyad are well aligned for effective integration into NiO‐based DSSCs. Notably, photovoltaic performance measurements show that solar cells sensitized with the covalent dyad exhibit significantly enhanced efficiencies compared with those using the reference compounds and other “ZnP‐Acceptor” dyads. These findings highlight the potential of covalent ZnPor‐C60 assemblies in advancing the design of high‐performance p‐type DSSCs.",

    "abstract": "Altering the manner in which groups are connected could offer a straightforward approach to achieving different functionality. Herein, heterotetraarylene molecules with varying bond‐linked quinoline moieties are synthesized and designed to investigate their differential performances. The heterotetraarylene with carbon‐carbon double bonded quinolines exhibits multifunctional properties: 1) all‐visible light‐induced photochromism, 2) acidochromism, and 3) acid–base gated photoswitch. Simultaneously, it achieves dual‐mode fluorescence modulation through both photoexcitation and acid/base stimuli. However, the heterotetraarylene and quinoline connected by carbon carbon single bonds exhibit divergent properties, including light‐induced emission enhancement and solvent‐dependent fluorescence emission. This bond‐selective functional divergence enables precise customization of stimulus‐responsive fluorescence through simple connectivity control, establishing a novel design paradigm for smart molecular systems. Furthermore, the heterotetraarylene‐linked quinolines with carbon carbon double bonds exhibit many properties, thus allowing for the construction of a new dual‐responsive encryption system.",

Herein, a strategy is reported for achieving higher quantum yields of NIR‐light‐driven photocatalytic H2 production using salts of diprotonated dodecaphenylporphyrin (H4DPP2+(X−)2), showing large saddle distortion as organic photosensitizers and platinum nanoparticles as catalysts. When a perchlorate ion (ClO4−) is employed as a counter ion (X−) of H4DPP2+(X−)2, the quantum yield of the photocatalytic H2 production reaches to 36% by excitation at 750 nm, which is the highest value among those of NIR‐light‐driven H2 production reported so far. Such a drastic enhancement of the quantum yield is achieved by selection of X− as an appropriate counter anion of H4DPP2+, judging from second‐order rate constants of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from electron donors to 3(H4DPP2+(X−)2)* and the reorganization energy of ET for H4DPP2+(X−)2.",

When 2,5‐diformylfuran (DFF) and methyl levulinate (MLA) were employed as substrates, the yield of long‐chain dicarboxylic acid ester precursors reached 91.0% in the presence of pyrrolidine lactate. This preparation process eliminated the need for additional acids and bases, thereby minimizing the generation of waste salts, which was a common issue in base‐catalyzed systems and biosynthesis methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization revealed that a strong interaction between the hydroxyl group of the catalyst and the carbonyl group of MLA facilitated the activation of the substrate for the aldol condensation reaction. Notably, the yield of dicarboxylic acid ester precursors remained stable even after five catalytic cycles, demonstrating the excellent reusability of the catalyst. Furthermore, pyrrolidine lactate exhibited broad applicability in both aldol condensation and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. This work presented a novel and sustainable strategy for the synthesis of long‐chain dicarboxylic acid ester precursors.",

Herein, the impact on the Brønsted acidity (probed by pyridine adsorption and thermodesorption) and on the catalytic properties (in meta‐xylene isomerization) of ZSM‐5 zeolites shaped with silica binders is quantified. The effect of sodium was assessed by using two binders exhibiting different sodium contents. Operando infrared monitoring of the reaction shows that only a portion of the zeolite crystallites is active at short time on stream, which suggests that the inner part of the crystallites does not take part in the catalytic test reaction. The evolution of acidity and activity upon shaping by extrusion is compatible with a model where sodium from the binder heterogeneously poisons the zeolites dominantly at the outer shell of the crystallites. The quantitative impact of shaping zeolites thus depends strongly on the silica source, the crystallite size and shape, the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, and on the catalytic reaction of interest.",

The use of these supports was found to enhance the reducibility and dispersion of the iridium phase, while the presence of acid sites of varying strengths contributed to higher catalytic activity in the toluene hydrogenation reaction. The innovation of the applied synthesis method lies in the use of ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) as the aluminum source and hydrogen fluoride as the fluorine source. Proper selection of the AACH and HF ratios enables the synthesis of binary materials with controlled Al₂O₃ and AlF₃ content, as well as tailored textural, structural, and acidic properties. The effect of calcination temperature on crystallinity, the type of crystal phases formed, and the resulting porous structure of the binary supports was investigated. It was found that the AlF₃–Al₂O₃ support, after calcination at 500 °C, exhibits a mesoporous structure with a surface area of 102 m2/g and the presence of the AlF1.96(OH)1.04 phase, which proved to be the most effective support for the iridium active phase.

The gCN/NiO‐3.12%/Pt(IV) heterojunctions, with 1.31 wt% Pt, exhibited the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 132.9 mol H₂ mol Pt−¹ min−¹ in hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis, which is 1.9 times higher than that of gCN/Pt(IV) nanocomposites. The enhanced activity of the gCN/NiO/Pt nanocatalysts can be attributed to the heterojunction formed between gCN and NiO, which facilitates greater visible‐light absorption, more efficient photo‐induced charge separation, and improved charge carrier transfer compared to the gCN/Pt nanocatalysts in photo‐assisted HAB. Reusability tests demonstrated that the gCN/NiO/Pt heterojunction photocatalysts retained 84% of their initial hydrogen generation rate (mL H₂/min) after five consecutive runs of HAB.

In this context, reforming of the mixed alkanes (RMA) in the purge gas and recycling of the produced syngas can effectively enhance the carbon and hydrogen efficiency of C1 chemistry. However, in‐depth structure‐performance relationships and catalytic mechanisms were rarely investigated for RMA, which forms a major research gap for further development. Herein, a series of Ni–MgO–CeO2 catalysts with different Mg and Ce contents were prepared, and the catalytic performance in reforming of mixed alkanes was investigated. It was found that smaller Ni particles on the Mg‐rich samples (NM6C0 and NM5C1) are more effective for the activation of C2H6. However, the generated CxHy intermediates cannot be converted with matching kinetics, which resulted in the formation of unwanted CH4 and more importantly, larger amounts of carbon deposition. On the other hand, despite a moderate C2H6 conversion is observed on Ce‐rich samples, appropriate balance between the generation of CxHy intermediates from alkanes and their conversion aided by the activated CO2 and H2O can be established, resulting in excellent anticarbon properties. Overall, the optimum catalyst (NM3C3) showed stable CH4 and C2H6 conversion (28% and 43%, respectively) and negligible carbon formation in 100‐h operation. Upon the comparison with individual reforming of CH4 and C2H6, this study also presented in‐depth understanding on the different mechanism and reaction network for reforming of mixed alkanes, which solidifies the foundation of catalyst design in related areas including CO2 utilization or C1 reforming.",

TMDCs possess excellent physicochemical characteristics with tuneable bandgaps, large surface area, and intense visible‐light absorption that render them exceptionally competent for initiating photo‐induced redox reactions. The review highlights mechanistic understanding concerning charge carrier generation and separation, defect engineering, and interfacial electron transfer, all of which is a key to improved photocatalytic performance. Particular focus is on pollutant degradation mechanisms, water splitting kinetics, and CO₂ photoreduction mechanisms. Though promising, TMDCs face challenges such as photo‐corrosion, short‐term stability issues, and scale‐up limitations. To overcome these challenges, the formation of heterojunctions with visible‐light‐active semiconductors, such as halide perovskites, is emphasized as a potential method to enhance charge separation and broaden spectral response. Furthermore, the integration of TMDCs with cocatalysts and the design of multicomponent heterostructures are investigated as methods to promote durability and efficiency. This review emphasizes the central role of TMDCs in developing scalable and sustainable photocatalytic systems for environmental and energy applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFlavin‐dependent halogenases (FDHs) are remarkable biocatalysts because they can catalyze the precise installation of carbon‐halogen (C─X) bonds in organic compounds due to their specific catalytic features. Recently, many notable FDHs with potential applications in diverse and challenging synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical biosynthesis processes have been reported. Various new FDHs, especially single‐component halogenases with novel functions and mechanisms, can catalyze the halogenation of diverse substrate scaffolds beyond just simple aromatic halogenation. This concept article discusses recent findings obtained over the past 5 years for novel FDHs and highlights important structural and mechanistic insights into single‐component FDH catalysis. Furthermore, new approaches for identifying non‐native halogenases are discussed, and a showcase of redesigned FDHs with expanded catalytic functions is presented.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of efficient photocatalytic systems based on earth‐abundant metals for the direct conversion of CO2 into renewable solar fuels is transforming the landscape of solar energy conversion. In this study, we present a novel photocatalytic system utilizing the triangulenium dye (N,N′,N′′‐tris(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐triazatriangulenium (TATH) hexafluorophosphate) as the organic photosensitizer, paired with an iron‐quaterpyridine molecular catalyst and BIH/TEOA as sacrificial electron donors. The photocatalytic performance is significantly enhanced through a synergistic electron‐proton relay mechanism between BIH and TEOA, which effectively mitigates charge recombination during CO2 reduction. Operated in a MeCN/NaHCO3 buffer under visible light, this system demonstrates exceptional activity and selectivity for CO production, achieving a turnover number (TON) exceeding 20,000, a quantum yield of 41.6%, and >99% product selectivity. These results surpass benchmark systems employing noble‐metal photosensitizers such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or [Ir(bpy)(ppy)2]+ under identical conditions. Remarkably, both the photosensitizer and catalyst maintain exceptional operational stability by their high individual TONs. This versatile, noble‐metal‐free system holds great potential for advancing direct solar‐to‐fuel photocatalytic CO2 reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNitrogen‐doped carbon (NC)‐supported Mo and Ni–Mo catalysts were synthesized via pyrolysis and impregnation strategies to investigate their performance in methane dry reforming (DRM). By modulating nitrogen content (1.65–13.25 at.%) and speciation (pyridinic/pyrrolic versus graphitic N) in NC supports, we demonstrated that nitrogen functionalities critically influence MoO2 reduction and Mo2C stabilization. Higher N content in NC2 and NC3 enhanced metal‐support interactions, promoting Mo2C formation during H2 reduction, while NC1 (low N) favored metallic Mo. However, under DRM conditions, all catalysts deactivated due to Mo2C oxidation to MoO2, with stability marginally improved at 850 °C via improved “oxidation‐re‐carbonization” cycles. Introducing Ni (5–15 wt.%) via impregnation facilitated CH4 dissociation and lowered MoO2 reduction temperatures through hydrogen spillover, boosting initial CH4/CO2 conversions and H2/CO ratios. Yet, Ni incorporation accelerated carbon support degradation (>50% mass loss) and induced inactive phases (NiO, Ni3Mo3N), offsetting its promotional effects. Combined XRD, H2‐TPR, Raman, and XPS analyses revealed the interplay between N defects, Mo speciation, and Ni–Mo interactions, underscoring the challenges in balancing activity and stability. This study highlights the dual role of nitrogen in stabilizing active phases and the limitations of Ni–Mo bifunctionality under oxidative DRM conditions, providing critical insights for designing robust, carbon‐supported catalysts through defect engineering and structural optimization.",

FA dehydrogenation occurs under near‐ambient conditions using palladium/activated carbon (Pd/AC) catalysts, but aspects like high Pd loading and gradual catalyst deactivation remain key challenges. This study investigates how the physicochemical properties of Pd nanoparticles and support characteristics influence the continuous process performance including FA conversion, evolved gas flow rate, total hydrogen production, and catalyst durability. Pd catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation using various precursors, powdered supports, and Pd loadings and evaluated in a fixed‐bed reactor. The findings reveal that Pd/AC catalysts prepared with PdCl₂ precursor and nanopowdered AC are the most efficient. Strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged PdCl₄2⁻ species and the positively charged AC surface during impregnation enhance nanoparticle support interactions, resulting in small (∼2 nm), highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles with a high Pd2⁺/Pd⁰ atomic surface ratio. Metal dispersion is the dominant factor influencing hydrogen production, surpassing the effects of both particle size and electronic state. Higher Pd loadings also increased catalyst durability, reducing regeneration frequency. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Pd/AC catalysts, paving the way for efficient FA utilization as a hydrogen carrier.",

This semiquinonate radical conducts hydrogen atom transfer reactions to facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions of a large number of alcohols. Leveraging on the dehydrogenating ability of PD that easily conducts 2e−/2H+ redox shuttles, olefination reaction was conducted on heteroarene methyl, fluorenes under mild conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic process works under aerobic conditions since oxygen regenerates the catalyst. The methodological development is a significant improvement over many transition metal catalysts for this task, which often work at high temperature and anaerobic reaction conditions.",

For some time now, it has been known that shear is unlikely to harm most proteins directly. Rather, interfacial phenomena, particularly those involving dynamic gas‐liquid interfaces are critical contributors to protein damage, which leads to aggregation and compromises stability. This work investigated the kinetic stability of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase (HMFO; EC: 1.1.3.47) in a 2 L stirred tank reactor. Exposure experiments revealed that the leading cause of enzyme deactivation was exposure to the gas‐liquid interface, either produced deliberately when sparging gas into the system or by accidental air entrainment from the overhead space due to mechanical stirring. This was further proven by experiments using the Bio Thrust membrane module, which enabled bubble‐free aeration thus, confirming that exposure to the gas‐liquid interface is the leading cause of deactivation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA novel strategy to synthesize micro‐structured cobaltite (ACo2O4; A = Fe, Mn, Cu) catalysts with tunable catalytic properties exhibiting highly selective production of glycerol carbonate via urea glycerolysis reaction is demonstrated. FeCo2O4 microcubes, MnCo2O4 microspheres, and CuCo2O4 micro‐octahedrons were produced via an ultrasonication‐assisted hydrothermal approach. The impact of urea (U), semicarbazide (S) as structure directing agents (SDAs), and metal ion substitution (A = Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+) on catalyst morphology and acid–base active sites in cobaltite is confirmed using various material characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The enhanced catalytic properties resulted in a significant improvement in their catalytic performance, particularly in terms of activity and selectivity. The order of yield (Y) and selectivity (S) for GC production is FeCo2O4‐U microcubes (Y95 ± 3%, S99%) > MnCo2O4‐S microspheres (Y91.5 ± 3%, S98.5%) > CuCo2O4‐S micro‐octahedrons (Y83.4 ± 3%, S92.4%) > Co3O4 (Y35 ± 3%, 99%), as determined using the GC‐MS analysis. This performance is attributed to the effective catalytic activation of urea, leading to enhanced GC production via the isocyanic acid pathway. Therefore, the strategies presented in this work could be further extended to other spinel compounds to achieve desired catalytic properties for chemical transformations of industrial interest.",

Improving hydrophilicity has been found to address this issue. CoFeCr LDH/NF, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with good hydrophilicity and a nanoflower structure, is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Hydrophilicity affects the size of bubbles produced, with better hydrophilic electrodes generating smaller, more easily disrupted bubbles. The cavitation effect upon bubble rupture releases heat, breaking water molecules to produce free OH⁻ and promoting the reconstruction of CoFeCr LDH. Additionally, the nanoflower structure of CoFeCr LDH features numerous micropores, enhancing the surface roughness of NF, and resulting in more uniform bubble sizes. Solution convection induced by ultrasound gathers small bubbles into larger ones, which are more easily removed by ultrasound. At 30 mA cm−2, ultrasound reduces the overpotential for HER and OER by 17 mV and 16 mV, respectively. Enhanced hydrophilicity significantly improves the efficiency of CoFeCr LDH/NF in water electrolysis, especially in OER.",

This necessitates the designing of highly active and stable Co‐based electrocatalysts for UOR. Herein, the influence of electronic modulation in the synthesized borophene–cobalt phosphate catalyst (B@CP) for generating active sites for UOR was studied. The addition of urea to the alkaline electrolyte as a sacrificial agent significantly reduced the potential required by B@CP for UOR compared to OER for attaining a fixed current density. B@CP achieved the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at potentials of 1.31 V and 1.40 V, respectively. Adding borophene to the catalyst also modified its morphology and charge transport, enhancing the UOR kinetics, reducing the charge transfer resistance, and exposing more electrochemically active sites. Moreover, B@CP displayed long‐term UOR stability for 50 h. This work will encourage the development of innovative strategies for tuning the properties of different transition metal‐based electrocatalysts via borophene for various energy conversion applications.",

We explore its catalytic properties, substrate scope, and recyclability. Furthermore, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals the material's evolution over multiple catalytic cycles.

    "abstract": "AbstractA new class of skeleton nickel catalysts with high activity and selectivity in the CO2 methanation reaction has been developed, where magnesium fluoride plays a structure‐forming component. The precursor for the skeleton catalyst is a binary magnesium–nickel fluoride solid solution (MgF2–NiF2), synthesized using the precipitation method from magnesium nitrate, nickel nitrate, and ammonium fluoride. Upon reduction at 500 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere, only nickel fluoride is reduced, while magnesium fluoride maintains its structure unchanged, forming the structural framework for nickel nanoparticles. The catalyst achieves a specific surface area of up to 87.2 m2g−1 and a nickel metal surface area of up to 3.06 m2g−1. The most active catalyst, containing 73.1 wt.% Ni can convert 73% of CO2 to methane, with a selectivity of nearly 98% and a carbon balance of 0.98 at 400 °C, under high GHSV = 20,000 h−1. Among the factors contributing to the high catalytic activity, the metallic surface area measured by hydrogen chemisorption, the content of metallic nickel, and the amount of hydroxyl groups were identified. A strong correlation with catalytic activity was also observed for the surface composition of the catalysts determined by XPS, including: (1) total nickel content, (2) metallic nickel content, (3) oxygen content, and (4) the atomic Ni/Mg ratio. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between the activity and the surface basicity of the catalysts as measured by the CO2‐TPD method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In Venus’s mesosphere, the observation/model discrepancy of molecular oxygen, O2, abundance has been a long-standing puzzle. Chlorine atoms have been proposed as a catalyst to oxidize carbon monoxide through the formation of chloroformyl radicals (ClCO), removing O2 and ultimately generating CO2. However, relevant kinetic studies of this catalytic cycle are scarce and highly uncertain. In this work, we report the spectrum of the ClCO radical between 210–520 nm using a multipass UV–Vis spectrometer coupled to a pulsed-laser photolysis flow reactor at 236–294 K temperature and 50–491 Torr pressure ranges. High-level ab initio calculations were performed to simulate the observed spectrum and to investigate the electronic structure. In addition, we observed the formation of molecular chlorine, Cl2, and phosgene, Cl2CO, suggesting that both the terminal chlorine and the central carbon in the ClCO radical are reactive towards chlorine atoms. Most importantly, the reported spectrum will enable future measurements of essential kinetic parameters related to ClCO radicals, which are important in regulating the O2 abundance in Venus’s mesosphere.",

We present a straightforward method for achieving high-concentration and long-term stable graphene suspensions by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) via a combination of ammonia (NH3) as an easily removable additive together with low-boiling point, benign organic-water co-solvent mixtures as suspension media. We find that the addition of small amounts of NH3 as an additive drastically improves the obtainable LPE graphene concentrations by up to 2 orders of magnitude for a wide range of organic-water co-solvent mixtures including with isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone, ethylene glycol and tert-butanol. With our approach we readily reach current benchmark graphene concentration values of ~180 mg·L-1 that are normally only obtainable using hard-to-remove high-boiling-point and hazardous standard solvents like dimethylformamide and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolydone or with hard-to-remove surfactants. Notably, NH3 as an additive is highly volatile and thus, as we show, easily removable without degrading the produced high quality graphene nanosheets.",

Here, we use a model formulation to develop cryogenic sample preparation for molecular depth profiling Orbitrap secondary ion mass spectrometry (Cryo-OrbiSIMS) preceded by morphological characterisation using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). It is found that the depth distribution of individual lipid components is revealed relative to the surface and the RNA cargo defining the core. A preferential lipid orientation can be determined for the 1,2-Dimyristoyl-glycero-3-methox-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DMG-PEG2k) molecule, by comparing the profiles of PEG to DMG fragments. PEG fragments are found immediately during analysis of the LNP surface, while the DMG fragments are deeper, coincident with RNA ions located in the core, in agreement with established models of LNPs.

Its activity can be controlled by ligands offering access to pharmacological Nurr1 modulation. However, the binding epitope(s) and molecular activation mechanisms of synthetic Nurr1 activators remained elusive but are essential to advance Nurr1 ligands towards new medicines. Here we characterized Nurr1 dimer dissociation and coregulator release as molecular contributions to Nurr1 activation by vidofludimus and locate its binding in an allosteric surface pocket lined by helices 1, 5, 7, and 8 by mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation. Structure-guided ligand design using these insights resulted in an optimized Nurr1 agonist with substantially enhanced potency and binding affinity. Our results provide a structural and molecular basis for Nurr1 activation by a synthetic agonist which was lacking for rational ligand design.",

These forces, termed reactive-orbital-based electrostatic forces, arise from the negative gradient of orbital energy, creating a direct connection between orbital energy variations and nuclear motion. Through the analysis of 48 representative reactions, we identify two predominant types of force behavior: reactions that sustain reaction-direction forces either from the early stages or just before the transition state. These forces carve grooves along the intrinsic reaction coordinates on the potential energy surface, shaping the reaction pathway. This clarifies which types of electron transfer contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. This study provides a framework for understanding the driving forces behind chemical transformations, offering insights into the electronic basis of reaction mechanisms.",

By leveraging this reactivity, we developed a regiospecific synthesis of unsymmetrically 2,3-diaryl substituted indoles from three readily available feedstocks: an amine, an arylglyoxal, and a boronic acid. While traditional Petasis reactions with similar three-component inputs are typically applied to build C(sp3)-C(sp2) and C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds, the present transformation offers a special opportunity for constructing a C(sp2)-C(sp2) linkage. Highly substituted indole motifs with structural diversity in the C2 position are easily accessed by this three-component reaction.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) is an important relaxation process of excited atoms and molecules in an environment, producing low-energy electrons that may contribute to radiation damage. Despite its significance, the mechanisms influencing ICD in molecular complexes remain unclear. Here, we investigate and unambiguously prove the ICD process in thiophene dimer, an aromatic ring with a third-row atom. Using multi-particle momentum coincidence spectroscopy, accompanied by high-level electronic structure calculations, we elucidate that the ICD process is initiated from the sulfur-containing inner-valence orbitals which are energetically below the Auger threshold. This leads to an enhancement in the emission of low-energy ICD electrons compared to other aromatic ring dimers. By utilizing this ‘ICD-only decay’ contribution we quantify ICD probabilities above the Auger threshold. This study reveals the pivotal role of sulfur in shaping the ICD electron spectrum, which can be implied to control the low-energy electron emission in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Model-based analysis is essential for extracting information about chemical reaction kinetics in full detail from time-resolved data sets. This approach combines experimental hypotheses with mathematical and physical models, enabling a concise description of complex system dynamics and the extraction of kinetic parameters like kinetic pathways, time constants, and species amplitudes. However, building the final kinetic model requires several intermediate steps, including testing various assumptions and models across multiple experiments. In complex cases, some intermediate states may be unknown and are often simplified. This approach requires expertise in modeling and data comprehension, as poor decisions at any stage during data analysis can lead to an incorrect kinetic model, resulting in inaccurate results. Here, we introduce DLRN, a new deep learning-based framework, designed to rapidly provide a kinetic reaction network, time constants, and amplitude for the system, with comparable performance and, in part, even better than a classical fitting analysis. We demonstrate DLRN’s utility in analyzing multiple timescales datasets with complex kinetics, different 2D systems such as time-resolved spectra and agarose gel electrophoresis data, experimental datasets as nitrogen vacancy and strand displacement circuit (using photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques), even in scenarios where the initial state is a hidden, non-emitting dark state.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In the past few decades, tremendous attention has been devoted to enhancing the activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for hydrogen production, while the cost and long-term stability of catalysts, which can play an even more important role in industrialization, have been much less emphasized. Herein, we engineered an OER electrode from abundant stainless steel (SS) via facile approaches, and the obtained electrode consists of a Ni-rich oxide surface layer with a Fe-rich metal substrate. An outstanding activity was observed with an overpotential of 316 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, an electrode self-replenishing concept is proposed in which a Ni-rich catalyst layer can be regenerated from a metallic substrate due to the difference in diffusion and dissolution rates of metal oxides/hydroxides, and this regeneration is validated by various characterizations. A recorded degradation rate of 0.012 was observed at 1000 mA cm−2 for 1000 h. The facile engineering of OER electrodes from SS combined with the self-replenishing catalyst can potentially address the cost, activity, and long-term stability barriers.",

We developed a novel t-SPESI unit that can be used in combination with an inverted fluorescence microscope and basic technologies to extract components from microregions of cells and measure ions with high sensitivity. We performed multimodal (fluorescence, lipid ion, and topographic) imaging of two types of HeLa cells labeled with fluorescent dyes and chemically fixed and showed the potential for subcellular-scale analysis of both cell structure and chemical composition. Furthermore, we evaluated the lipid species by comparing the SC-MSI results with those of supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The technical advancement presented here is effective for distinguishing cell types based on the signal intensity of lipid ions in single cells and investigating differences in the subcellular localization of lipids in different types of cells.",

Although OAD has been used for untargeted lipidomics, its availability has been limited to the positive ion mode, requiring the independent use of a collision-induced dissociation (CID) method. In this study, we demonstrated the OAD MS/MS technique in the negative-ion mode for profiling phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, and sulfatides, where the fragmentation mechanism remained consistent with that in the positive ion mode. Furthermore, we proposed optimal conditions for the simultaneous acquisition of CID- and OAD-specific fragment ions, termed OAciD, where oxygen atoms and hydroxy radicals facilitate C=C position-specific fragmentation, while residual water vapor induces cleavage of low-energy covalent bonds as observed in CID. Finally, theoretical fragment ions were implemented in MS-DIAL 5 to accelerate C=C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics. The OAciD methodology was used to illuminate brain region-specific marmoset lipidomes with C=C positional information, including the estimation of C=C positional isomer ratios. We also characterized the profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids, finding that lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids were enriched in the cerebellum, whereas those containing omega-6 fatty acids were more abundant in the hippocampus and frontal lobe.",

While NOS linkages in proteins were once assumed to occur only between lysine and cysteine, our investigation shows that these bonds extend beyond the well–studied lysine-NOS-cysteine examples. By systematically analyzing over 86,000 high–resolution X-ray protein structures, we uncovered 69 additional NOS bonds, including arginine-NOS-cysteine and glycine-NOS-cysteine. Our pipeline integrates machine learning, quantum–mechanical calculations, and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data to systematically detect these subtle covalent interactions and identify key predictive descriptors for their formation. The discovery of these previously unrecognized linkages broadens the scope of protein chemistry and may enable targeted modulation in drug design and protein engineering. Although our study focuses on NOS linkages, the flexibility of this methodology allows for the investigation of a wide range of chemical bonds and covalent modifications, including structurally resolvable posttranslational modifications (PTMs). By revisiting and re-examining well-established protein models, this work underscores how systematic data-driven approaches can uncover hidden aspects of protein chemistry and inspire deeper insights into protein function and stability.",

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL), generated from tryptic digestion of 42 human recombinant proteins, in enhancing the detection and quantification of lower-abundance cancer-associated proteins. Additionally, we generated a combined sample-specific biological-rPSL by integrating the rPSL with a spectral library derived from pooled biological samples. We compared the performance of these libraries for DIA data extraction with standard methods, including sample-specific biological spectral library and library-free DIA methods. Our specific focus was on quantifying cancer-associated proteins, including key enzymes involved in kynurenine pathway, across patient-derived tissues and cell lines. Both rPSL and biological-rPSL-DIA approaches provided significantly improved coverage of lower-abundance proteins, enhancing sensitivity and more consistent protein quantification across matched tumour and adjacent noncancerous tissues from breast and colorectal cancer patients and in cancer cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that rPSL and biological-rPSL coupled with DIA-MS workflows, can address the limitations of both biological library-based and library-free DIA methods, offering a robust approach for quantifying low-abundance cancer-associated proteins in complex biological samples.",

This paper describes experimental data and a prediction model for challenging CCS prediction tasks including longer peptides that tend to have higher charge states. The proposed model is based on a pretrained deep protein language model. While the conventional prediction model requires training from scratch, the proposed model enables training with less amount of time owing to the use of the pretrained model as a feature extractor. Results of experiments with the novel experimental data show that the proposed model succeeds in drastically reducing the training time while maintaining the same or even better prediction performance compared with the conventional method.

    "abstract": "Recently, the aromaticity and antiaromaticity of organometallacycles have received much attention to understand the cyclic electronic delocalization through d orbitals on the metal center. Here, we prepared a Pd(II) platina(II)corrole bipyridyl complex, which was converted to the corresponding stable Pt(IV) complex upon oxidation with iodobenzene dichloride. Oxidation of the platinum center did not result in the C-C bond formation between two pyrrole units via reductive elimination. The X-ray diffraction analysis of these complexes elucidated their nonplanar molecular structures. The nonaromatic nature of platina(II)- and platina(IV)corroles was revealed by 1H NMR analysis and NICS calculations.",

They are formed via the anion-exchange reaction between lanthanide(III) bromide and metal(II) acetate salts and driven by a mismatch in hard-soft acid-base character. The crystal structure of EuHg revealed a heteropolymeric 1-D structure, with cationic acetate-bridged and anionic bromide-bridged chains forming parallel arrays; IR, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopic data of LnPb strongly suggested similarity with the LnHg compounds. The analogous reaction with EuCl3·6H2O and Hg(OAc)2 forms an isostructural material, but substituting Pb(OAc)2 generates [Eu(OAc)2(OH2)3]Cl and PbCl2 instead of a mixed-metal product comparable to LnPb. An N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate [Eu(OAc)2(DMF)3](PbBr3)] (EuPb·DMF) was structurally characterized, showing the same heteropolymeric motif as EuHg and resembling an organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskite due the anionic chain of face-sharing bromoplumbate(II) octahedra. Photoluminescence properties of the compounds, including lifetime measurements and Tb(III)→Eu(III) energy transfer parameters for the LnM 50:50 Eu/Tb solid-solutions are described.",

A high-throughput differential cell viability assay using colon cancer cell lines was developed to identify natural product modulators of TOP3B-associated cancer cell viability. The assay identified an organic extract of the plant Centratherum punctatum as having cytotoxic activity. Seven new furanoheliangolides, centratherolides A-G (1-7), along with two known analogues (2,3-epoxybutyryloxy)-goyazensolanolide (8) and goyazensolide (9), were isolated. Compounds 1, 8, and 9 exhibited selective cytotoxic activities against the TOP3B-knockout (TOP3B-KO) human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells compared with the wild-type HCT116 cells (TOP3B-WT). The challenging absolute configuration determination of the flexible chiral side chains in selected analogues (1-4 and 8) was resolved by combined approaches, including synthesis of chemical standards, DFT ECD calculation, and chiral HPLC analysis. Application of this elucidation methodology to a commercial sesquiterpene lactone clarified a contradiction in the stereochemical assignments reported for centaurepensin/chlorohyssopifolin A and 17-epi-chlorohyssopifolin A.",

    "abstract": "Essential trace metals are vital for cellular processes, such as respiration, DNA replication, and photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria must tightly regulate metal homeostasis to prevent deficiency or toxicity, yet their metallophores remain overlooked. Here, we report lusichelins A-E (1-5), new metallophores isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lusitaniella coriacea LEGE 07167. Their structures and configurational assignments were determined by using NMR, mass spectrometry, TD-DFT calculations, and retrobiosynthetic insights. Lusichelins feature a unique structural arrangement with thiazoline/thiazole rings connected via a vinyl group, an aliphatic carbon chain, or directly enabling the potential for metal coordination. Genomic analysis identified a hybrid PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with the lusichelin structure, bearing traits characteristic of metallophore biosynthesis. Functionally, lusichelins act as metallophores capable of chelating both iron and copper. Lusichelin C (3) consistently bound iron under both metal-rich and metal-limited culture conditions, while copper complexation was only observed under elevated copper levels. At physiologically relevant pH values, no significant metal-binding preference was detected. Moreover, compound production was maximized under metal-rich conditions and in response to copper limitation. Lusichelin B (2) exhibited cytotoxicity against colon carcinoma cells while reversing multidrug resistance via ABCB1 efflux pump modulation. These findings expand our understanding of cyanobacterial metallophores in microbial metal homeostasis and highlight their biological potential.",

The absolute stereochemistry of HICA was determined to be R in fusarihexin C using a modified Mosher's method. It was assumed that HICA in fusarihexins D and E would have the same configuration, as they are derived from the same biological source. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structures of fusarihexins D and E as well as three new analogues. The compounds were synthesized by employing solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and high dilution macrolactamization and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Comparing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of synthesized and natural compounds revealed that the HICA residue has the S-configuration in fusarihexin D. The antiplasmodium activity on Plasmodium falciparum and antitumor activity against MCF7 and A431 cells were also investigated. Encouragingly, fusarihexin D (with S-HICA) displayed potent antiplasmodium activity by interfering with the ring stage of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite life cycle (IC50 at 650 nM).",

The results highlight the advantages of (7S,7'S,8'S)-2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan, (-)-γ-diisoeugenol. A series of derivatives with effective absolute configurations were synthesized with high stereoselectivity via intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reactions, and biological assays were performed. The most effective compound identified in this research was the (4-OCH3, 5-OCH3, 3'-CF3, 4'-OH)-derivative (EC50 = 8.6 μM). The combination of a hydrophobic group at the 3'-position and a phenolic hydroxy group at the 4'-position was crucial for the high activity. The 8'-epimer of the effective (7S,7'S,8'S)-2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan compound was also prepared by stereoselective hydrogenation of the 7-8' internal alkene. Thus, a novel anti-phytopathogenic fungal 2,7'-cyclo-7,8'-neolignan-type indane was developed.",

Mass spectrometry-based molecular networking and other advanced computational data mining techniques were employed to explore the chemical space of natural AETX derivatives. We identified a total of 43 biosynthetic intermediates and derivatives of AETX, including several iodinated derivatives, a rare halogenation in specialized metabolites of freshwater organisms. Structural characterization of these metabolites showed that most of them are AETX derivatives with varying substitution patterns of the bromo or iodo substituents, but also, AETX biosynthetic intermediates and other biindole derivatives were detected.

In this study, three unusual C30 ergosterols, cordycepsterols A-C (1-3), have been isolated from this fungus. Their structures have been identified according to extensive spectroscopic methods as well as computational quantum chemistry. They possess an unusual 6/6/6/5/6-fused pentacyclic system which might be derived from a normal ergosterol backbone by adding two skeletal carbons. Compounds 1-3 exhibit significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide production with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 3.0, 0.9, and 2.3 μM, respectively. They could significantly suppress the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 at the concentration of 5 μM, which indicated that C. militaris and its cordycepsterols A-C have a potential anti-inflammatory application prospect.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived natural products are commonly consumed orally and can be structurally modified by the gut microbiota, potentially altering their biological activity. However, high-throughput studies on their microbial metabolism remain limited. This study applied an in vitro screening system for microbiome-derived metabolism using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolism of 200 natural products by human gut microbiota, and successfully annotated 118 natural products metabolized by gut microbiota. For the first time, metabolic reactions of isorhynchophylline and wilforgine in the intestine were documented. Notably, a substantial increase in the plasma concentration of isocorynoxeine was observed in human microbiota-colonized rats following isorhynchophylline administration compared to those without colonization, suggesting that the dehydrogenation of isorhynchophylline by gut microbiota observed in the in vitro screening system also occurs in vivo. 16S rRNA gene sequencing further revealed an increased abundance of Klebsiella and Escherichia-Shigella following isorhynchophylline administration, suggesting that these genera may influence its microbial transformation or pharmacological activity.",

However, the stereochemical complexity of 2,5-DKPs presents challenges in chemical synthesis, particularly concerning indole derivatives such as indole diketopiperazines (IDKPs). Prenylation and oxidation further diversify these structures, enhancing their bioactivity and membrane affinity. Despite recent advances, the biosynthetic pathways of IDKPs, especially those involving dual prenylation, remain inadequately understood. In this study, the fellutanine biosynthetic gene cluster from Nannizzia fulva was cloned and heterologously expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. A partially oxidized intermediate in the fellutanine biosynthetic pathway was characterized. The dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS) enzyme FelB was shown to catalyze consecutive prenylations at two C-2 positions of cyclo(l-Trp-l-Trp) in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Additionally, comparative studies with the known DMATS enzyme OkaC revealed differences in the regioselectivity. Furthermore, the biprenylation mechanism of FelB and OkaC was elucidated through molecular docking and active site analysis.",

Here, we fabricated a cobalt oxide (Co3O4)‐synergised nickel‐doped ruthenium oxide (Ni‐RuO2) heterojunction on reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/Ni‐RuO2/rGO) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes. The interface of Co3O4/Ni‐RuO2 heterojunction and doping of Ni into RuO2, as well as their effect on electronic structure, were examined by advanced characterizations. With only 1.36 wt% RuO2, the Co3O4/Ni‐RuO2/rGO heterojunction revealed an ultra‐low overpotential of 195 and 305 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst's performance was well maintained after operating for 100 h at 500 mA cm−2, suggesting great promise for practical applications. Density functional theory calculations and in‐situ Raman analysis indicate that both the heterojunction structure and Ni doping play crucial roles in enhancing the OER activity and durability. This study provides a promising avenue for developing cost‐effective electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability for advanced energy conversion.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme‐responsive active transporting nanomedicines have shown promise in overcoming the tumor‐dense extracellular matrix barrier by inducing cancer cells’ intercellular transcytosis to deliver drugs deep into solid tumors. However, nanomedicine only responsive to the cancer cell‐related enzyme is not very effective in pancreatic tumors because successive transcytosis cannot be established among the cancer cells, which are scattered in a large number of cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here are reported dual‐enzyme responsive 7‐ethyl‐10‐hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)‐polymer conjugates capable of inducing transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs to infiltrate pancreatic tumors efficiently. The conjugates are zwitterionic for long blood circulation. Once in the tumor, the γ‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor endothelial and cancer cells, or the fibroblast‐activated protease (FAP) on CAFs, can cleave the γ‐glutamylamide or the prolylglycine dipeptide amides, producing primary amines. The cationized conjugate then induces transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs, establishing successive intercellular transport to infiltrate the tumor. The conjugates' enzyme reactivity and overall hydrophobicity determine their cationization and transcytosis behaviors. The conjugates with high hydrophobicity and fast cationization show potent antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer patient‐derived xenograft and orthotopic tumor models. This study provides an active transportation strategy to overcome the delivery barrier of tumors with rich stroma cells.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of imine‐linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has also drawn attention to the influence of the nature of imine binding, including its orientation and possible protonation, on the chemical and physical properties of imine COFs. However, the influence of the polarity of imine bond (C═N) on the photocatalytic performance of COFs has not yet been described. In this work, we synthesized a series of imine COFs with differently polarized C═N bonds by altering the C═N bond orientation and regulating the donor–acceptor (D–A) strength, respectively. The less polarized C═N bond for one of the COFs possesses a faster charge separation with a decrease of exciton binding energy (Eb). In contrast, the imine COF with more polarized C═N bond exhibits a stronger internal electric field contributing to a more efficient charge transfer. Taking into account this trade‐off between binding energy and charge transfer concerning the effect of C═N polarity on the photocatalytic performances, the imine COF with moderately polarized C═N bond shows the highest hydrogen evolution performance of 14.0 mmol h−1 g−1. This work provides evidence that the polarity of C═N should be taken into account when designing and tuning the properties of imine COFs.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can significantly enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy, via the transfer of polarization from unpaired electrons to nuclei. As a result, there is considerable interest in improving DNP efficiency, particularly through the development of new polarizing agents (PAs). Here, a series of 32 PAs, including 26 dinitroxide and 6 hetero biradicals, of which 11 are introduced for the first time, were evaluated in DNP NMR experiments at magnetic field strengths of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T. The PAs soluble in aqueous media were compared for different proton concentrations. A detailed comparison of the enhancement factors, polarization build‐up times, contribution factors, and the resulting overall sensitivity factors is provided. We find that the class of narrow‐line‐broad‐line biradicals not only yield the best performance at high field (21.1 T and 14.1 T), but also remain among the best at intermediate fields (9.4 T). Specifically, we find that SNAPol‐1 and HyTEK2 are consistently among the best performing radicals at any field. Among the dinitroxide biradicals, notably at 9.4 T, the AsymPol‐POK and M‐TinyPol families stand out in proton‐dense aqueous matrices, and a newly‐developed dinitroxide, NaphPolCbo, is found to provide the best overall sensitivity factor in organic solvent.",

However, it remains ambiguous how Fe‐S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox‐induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo‐Fe‐S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent‐ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride‐free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride‐free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe‐S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.",

However, their potential as functional materials has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by the unique properties of ionic liquids, organic liquids, and liquid metals, we explore liquid CPs as a platform for novel functionalities distinct from those of their crystalline and glass counterparts. Here, we present a strategy to achieve functional liquid CPs near ambient conditions by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier, shifting compositions away from stoichiometric ratios. This process disrupts extended coordination networks during melting, producing a stable liquid state. By tuning the ratio of network modifiers, we achieve control over liquid properties, including anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm−1 at 353 K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa·s at 303 K. These findings demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid CPs, introducing them as a new platform for designing liquid conductors.",

Herein, we report a topologically entangled polymer electrolyte featuring ionophilic–protonation dual side chains. The ionophilic functional groups on these side chains provide abundant coordination sites, significantly enhancing Li+ transport, while exposed carboxyl (–COOH) groups induce protonation on the cathode surface, effectively suppressing transition metal (TM) ion migration. The topologically entangled polymer network ensures uniform electric‐field distribution, mitigates lattice‐oxygen release, and maintains continuous Li+ conduction. As a result, this electrolyte achieves a high room‐temperature ionic conductivity of 0.81 mS cm−1 and an oxidation stability up to 4.9 V. Moreover, the in situ formed inorganic species (LiF, Li2O, and Li2CO3), stabilized the EEI, enabling stable cycling of the symmetric cell for 2000 hours. Batteries assembled with a high‐voltage Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 (LRMO) cathode retain a specific capacity of 217.37 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles, and Ah‐level pouch cell utilizing an LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode exhibits stable cycling performance over 150 cycles.

After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H2 generation.

    "abstract": "AbstractCobaloxime is a versatile 3d‐metal catalyst for dehydrogenative radical coupling reactions. Prior mechanistic studies of cobaloxime catalysis have revealed that cobaloxime(II)‐catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process can control the site‐selectivity and chemoselectivity of radical transformation. However, the relevance of HAT to the enantioselectivity is seldom reported. Herein, our density functional theory studies of the cobaloxime‐chiral amine co‐catalyzed enantioselective coupling of the enamine radical cation with alkene proved that it is the HAT step that determines the enantioselectivity, instead of the previously proposed radical addition. Because the metal–alkene‐coupled (MAC) radical addition is a reversible process while the followed by HAT is the rate‐determining step. Moreover, computational studies suggest that the dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the radical cation and cobaloxime plays a significant role in harnessing the reactivity and tuning the enantiocontrol. The intra‐ and inter‐molecular hydrogen bonding between the iminium and the cobaloxime fragments contributes to the lower energy barrier of MAC radical addition. Structural analysis and quantitative steric‐electronic effect dissection jointly unveiled that the stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the aminium and the cobaloxime fragments is the dominant factor that stabilizes the (R)‐HAT transition state and guarantees high enantioselectivity.",

However, conventional characterization techniques struggle to capture the dynamic processes and flooding at TPB. To address this, we develop operando electrochemical magnetic resonance imaging (EC‐MRI), an inherently non‐invasive technique sensitive to 1H, which probes both bulk and boundary regions, enabling real‐time visualization of TPB evolution and a deeper understanding of its function at the device level under operational conditions. In a study of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), with a focus on the kinetically sluggish O2 reduction reaction in cathode, operando EC‐MRI quantitatively illustrates the interplay between power output, water content, and TPB evolution. It reveals that the TPB maps undergo significant spatial and dynamic variations, with TPB deterioration, rather than apparent water accumulation, directly triggering flooding, as proved using catalysts with different water generation and adsorption capabilities. Our finding opens new perspectives on water management and TPB design, with potential applications in other critical electrochemical processes such as H2 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and N2 reduction, underscoring the value of operando EC‐MRI for real‐time diagnostics of electrochemical devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThrombosis is a pathological condition which represents the formation of clots inside blood vessels, blocking the flow of blood through the circulatory system. A high occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, has been observed in COVID‐19 patients. Platelets (thrombocytes), the small cell fragments in the blood, play crucial roles in vascular haemostasis and thrombosis. The activation and subsequent aggregation of platelets lead to the formation of thrombus, a key process in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, inhibitors of platelet aggregation are important for the prevention and treatment of many thrombotic disorders. As the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is known to prevent platelet‐dependent thrombosis, we have studied a series of antioxidant nanozymes for their ability to inhibit platelet activation/aggregation. Herein, we show that V2O5 nanozymes with specific and morphology‐dependent GPx activity effectively inhibit the aggregation of human platelets and prevent pulmonary thromboembolism in mice. Crucially, the nanozymes do not lead to the unwanted side effect of bleeding, which is important in the development of more effective and safe antithrombotic agents.",

The multi borylated arenes, on the other hand, have received much less attention because the preparation of multi borylated arenes in a straightforward manner is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present our findings on synthesizing bis borylated arenes from structure‐diverse and readily available aryl halides (Ar–X, X = Cl, Br, I). Simultaneous C−X and C−H borylation of aryl halides is achieved using earth‐abundant titanium as a catalyst. Not only the 1,2‐bis borylation but the 1,3‐ and 1,4‐bis borylation are also achieved. Control experiment and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computation propose an titanium‐mediated aryl radical‐driven reaction resulting selective bis‐borylation over mono‐borylation.",

Such mechanism reverses the sluggish diffusion kinetics. Moreover, merited by the common ion effect and drug dissolution, a suitable preaddition of Mn2+ to electrolyte inhibit Mn(III) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework.

Up to date, exciton regulation is still in its infancy. Here, via linkage engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we propose a fully conjugated sp2 carbon‐linked COFs (sp2c‐Py‐Bpy COFs) with strong exciton interaction and fast ISC for boosted 1O2 photosynthesis. The sp2c‐Py‐Bpy COFs delivers a record‐high 1O2 yield (624 μM min–1) with 100% selectivity, which is ca. 8 times that of the traditional imine‐bridged COFs (Im‐Py‐Bpy COFs, ca. 95.8% selectivity), outperforming documented systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the fully conjugated sp2 carbon linkage of sp2c‐Py‐Bpy COFs can enhance Coulomb interaction, promote ISC and push forward the transfer of triplet exciton to the O2 adsorption sites throughout the COFs matrix, jointly facilitating the energy transfer process for efficient 1O2 photosynthesis and bypassing the traditional electron transfer process. Hence, sp2c‐Py‐Bpy COFs can selectively degrade acetaminophen within minutes under visible light irradiation and enables stable degradation of emerging pollutants in a continuous flow membrane reactor (20 × 30 × 2 cm) utilizing natural sunlight and dissolved O2.",

    "abstract": "Carbon dots have made significant advancements in photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo‐ATRP), achieving ultrafast reaction rates and precise control over the resulting polymers. However, their ultrasmall size necessitates time‐consuming and resource‐intensive purification steps, which can ultimately lead to undesirable product contamination. In this study, we integrated dye‐derived carbon dots (NCD) into nitrogen‐deficient carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets via a hydrothermal process, forming NCD@CN heterojunctions with an expanded delocalized heterocyclic structure, enhanced specific surface area and improved light absorption. The chemical linkages between the two components created NCD@CN heterojunctions, which improved interfacial interactions and promoted efficient charge transfer. The NCD@CN heterojunctions demonstrated ultrahigh activity, comparable to the NCD precursors, achieving a turnover number up to 1780 and a turnover frequency up to 59.3 min‐1. This led to the production of polymers with tailor‐made structures, predicted molecular weights and narrow dispersities. Additionally, they enabled complete catalyst recovery across multiple polymerization cycles. The incorporation of NCD into CN nanosheets affords new territory for high‐performance photocatalysts at the atomic level and provides alternative pathways for ultrafast photo‐ATRP processes.",

Surprisingly, the by far most active catalyst features an uncommon tetrasubstituted ligand backbone that renders chloride binding to the active Ti(III) species less favorable and thereby increases catalyst activity due to improved substrate binding. Catalysis is most efficient in the ‘green’ solvent ethyl acetate and can be initiated using base metals as well as electrochemical methods for the reduction of the Ti(salen)‐precatalyst. Compared to the commonly employed titanocene catalysis, the use of the newly developed Ti(salen)‐catalyst allows for the use of milder and more sustainable reactions conditions, a broader substrate scope as well as facile modification of the catalyst's electronic and steric properties.",

In this study, we report a hexagonal close‐packed (hcp)‐PdMo catalyst that exhibits the highest room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol among reported catalysts, with 100% methanol selectivity and without any signs of deactivation. Structural analyses, which included various in situ and ex situ X‐ray techniques and infrared spectroscopy, have revealed that Mo and Pd serve as the active sites for CO2 adsorption and H2 dissociation, respectively. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is facilitated at room temperature on the surface of the hcp‐PdMo intermetallic catalyst, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanistic studies, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water‐gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&C) pathway though a Pd‐assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature. These findings not only reveal the origin of the reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis, but also open a new direction for the design of highly efficient catalysts that function under mild conditions.",

However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine‐bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of ZZ, EZ(=ZE), and EE geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the ZZ isomer predominated in trithiophene (ZZ:(EZ+ZE):EE = 58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near‐statistical distribution. X‐ray crystallography revealed intramolecular S···S chalcogen bonding in trithiophene with S···S distances (≈3.04 Å) shorter than van der Waals radii and C–S···S angles of 171°. Comprehensive conformer searches and DFT calculations not only validated the higher stability of the ZZ isomer in trithiophene but also provided calculated isomer distributions that closely matched the experimental values. Multi‐faceted computational analysis (ELF, NCI, QTAIM, and NBO) confirmed the presence of these chalcogen‐centeredinteractions and quantified their strength through lone pair LP(S)→σ*(S–C) donor‐acceptor orbital interactions. Trithiophene exhibited a unique dual‐chalcogen bonding mode in the ZZ configuration. These findings elucidate the role of chalcogen bonding in stabilizing ZZ‐trithiophenes and contribute to designing PTMs with controlled stereochemistry for organic electronics applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe have investigated the photochemistry of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in solution upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation in comparison to L‐cystine by femtosecond X‐ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K‐edge. For these aliphatic disulfides, the very similar differential absorption spectra reveal unequivocally a pair of geminate thiyl radicals as the single primary reaction product with a formation time constant of about 100 fs. We find size‐dependent majority yields for disulfide recombination with DMDS reforming ten‐fold slower and at lower quantum yield than L‐cystine while GSSG recombines even faster than L‐cystine at a yield of nearly 80 % within 2 ps after excitation. We attribute the much lower recombination rates and yields of DMDS to larger product separation after homolytic S−S bond cleavage due to the smaller thiyl radical mass and correspondingly larger mutual acceleration. Furthermore, we observe the delayed formation of at least one additional reaction product for these disulfides that we attribute to perthiyl radicals. The ultrafast recombination of L‐cystine and GSSG at majority yield in condensed phase suggests a dynamic S−S bond integrity which may be exploited in natural systems to mitigate UV radiation damage, and which could be of interest in materials design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe fascinating properties introduced by the breaking of mirror symmetry have recently motivated a rising interest in chirality in nanomaterials. In particular, transition metal (TM) dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a wide group of technologically relevant 2D layered materials where recent efforts in the introduction of chirality have shown promising results, attracting great attention for future studies and potential applications. This review article is focused on the development of chirality in TM dichalcogenide nanostructures, dealing with the synthetic strategies that have been adopted to produce chiral TMDs both via solution‐phase and vapor‐phase syntheses along with the characterization of their chiroptical properties. A broad range of examples, including a variety of nanostructures such as 0D quantum dots (QDs), 1D nanotubes, 2D flakes, and more complex 3D nanostructures as well as different origins of chirality are considered. Critical analysis of potential pitfalls in the assessment of the materials’ chirality are discussed. A broad range of exciting properties and applications associated with the materials’ chirality, including: nanomedicine, enantioselective catalysis, spin‐dependent electrocatalysis, spintronics, and nonlinear optics, are also presented in the review.",

    "abstract": "The oxidation of alcohols, amines, and halides is a fundamental transformation in organic chemistry with significant applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Here we show that a broad variety of N‐heteroarenes bearing hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, or halomethyl groups are oxidatively dehydrogenated to their respective aldehydes by simply heating them in acidic or basic aqueous solution under ambient atmosphere. The quantitative oxidation of 9‐acridinemethanol to 9‐acridinecarboxaldehyde serves as an illustrative example, proceeding to completion within 3 h in refluxing 5% aqueous acetic acid or even household vinegar. Quinoline derivatives may be similarly oxidized but require higher temperatures and longer reaction times, while indole derivatives are oxidized under basic conditions. Based on comprehensive regioselectivity screens, internal kinetic isotope competition, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism in which migration of a methylene hydrogen to the pyridinic nitrogen by acid‐catalyzed dearomative tautomerization yields an unstable enol or enamine intermediate that then irreversibly loses two hydrogen atoms to atmospheric oxygen. In addition to the simplicity and environmentally benign nature of our method, we observe no indication of any over‐oxidation to carboxylic acids. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this reaction through two different one‐pot formylations of acridine.",

However, the further growth of this field depends on the development of new probe structures to expand the proportion of the proteome that can be studied using these methods. Inspired by previous reports of succinimide-containing covalent inhibitors for proteases, we synthesized a panel of potential probe structures with a succinimide reactive group and a terminal alkyne tag suitable for subsequent azide-alkyne click chemistry. Members of this panel with an N-arylsulfonyl linker produce labeling of both purified serine proteases as well as proteins in complex cellular lysates. We found that one of these probes labels the human rhomboid protease RHBDL2 at low micromolar concentrations and can be competed with active-site inhibitors. Our studies establish succinimide as a new reactive group for the development of activity-based probes and offer a new chemical tool for studying a class of enzymes with limited functional characterization.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the potential application of six types of carbon dots (CDs) obtained from different organic sources as photoreductants. Such carbon nanomaterials were synthesized by two different approaches, either hydrothermal or pyrolytic, from citric acid and glucose as the starting organic substrates. On the other hand, carbon dots deriving from fishery waste (bass scales) and fruit processing waste (blackberries) have been also prepared. Diethylenetriamine was employed in some cases as the nitrogen source. The hydrothermal syntheses yielded amorphous CDs, which were either non-doped (a-CDs) or nitrogen-doped (a-N-CDs), whereas the pyrolytic treatment afforded graphitic CDs (g-CDs). The efficiency of the so obtained carbon nanomaterials was studied in the model photoreduction reaction of triarylsulfonium salts to diaryl sulfides. A comparison carried out on the results obtained points out the key role of the starting substrates in determining the photophysics and the photochemical efficiency of the resulting CDs. In this context, citric acid-derived materials (both graphitic and amorphous) were found as the most promising materials, while less satisfactory results have been observed when using CDs derived from glucose and biowastes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFlexible ionic conductors hold potential for wearable sensors and energy harvesting. However, most gel‐based conductors suffer from solvent evaporation and liquid leakage, limiting practical applications. Although solid‐state ionic conductors mitigate these issues, achieving strong mechanics, high conductivity, self‐healing, and stability remains challenging. Here, by integrating supramolecular engineering and dynamic covalent adaptive networks, a self‐healing polyurethane‐based solid‐state ion‐conductive elastomer (DACPU/100Li) with outstanding overall properties is successfully synthesized. DACPU/100Li exhibits ultrahigh ionic conductivity (1.23 × 10−3 S cm−1) and high tensile strength (7.62 MPa), along with an elongation at break of 1200%. Additionally, it exhibits excellent tear resistance and a fracture energy of 45.6 kJ m−2, along with 96% self‐healing efficiency (after self‐healing at 120 °C for 24 h), good recyclability, and stability under extreme conditions. The DACPU/100Li‐based sensor has high sensitivity (5.89) and a wide strain range (0.1–1000%). Integrated with machine learning, it enables precise gesture recognition and human–machine interaction. Furthermore, the triboelectric nanogenerator based on DACPU/100Li achieves a high power density of 3.87 W m−2. It harvests energy from body motion to power small devices and aids object recognition via machine learning. It is believed that these solid‐state ion‐conductive elastomers provide new opportunities for wearable electronics, energy harvesting, and ionotronics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSoft matter, featuring superior flexibility and intriguing tunability, has shown enormous potential in sensors, soft robots, and light tailoring. However, limited by its inherent structural complexity, soft matter remains uncompetitive in multidimensional and high‐density information optics. Herein, a heterogeneous liquid‐crystal (LC) superstructure composed of interlocked nematic and chiral LCs is designed to achieve higher‐dimensional light control. Optically multidimensional photopatterning with programmable UV polarization and dosage is proposed to precisely customize both transverse and longitudinal LC arrangements, bringing in a wide range of light‐matter interactions within a single micrometer‐thick film. The constructed heterogeneous LC superstructure not only enables simultaneous near‐field full‐color printing and far‐field full‐color holography but also boasts brightness controllability and polarization selectivity. This low‐cost photonic structure enables a high information density of ≈1.6 million hybrid‐dimensional optical data per square millimeter, unlocking new capabilities in optical storage, display, and encryption. This work creates an ingenious bond between advanced photopatterning technologies and higher‐level optical informatics, and pioneers soft‐matter‐mediated full‐dimensional optics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChiral organic–inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) are such a promising family of chiral semiconductors to directly sense circularly polarized light (CPL) due to inherent chiroptical activity, but face synthetic constraints due to a shortage of suitable chiral building blocks that generate chiral and 2D structures, which are a prerequisite for expected optoelectronic responses. Here, a halogen interaction assisted crystallization of a pair of chiral 2D OIHMHs, (R/S‐AMOL‐I)2PbI4 (1R/S; AMOL‐I = 1‐amino‐4‐iodobutan‐2‐ol cation) is reported. In situ iodine substitution in the chiral cation forms halogen‐halogen bond, favoring crystallization of the chiral&polar 2D structure and efficient chirality transfer. The inherent polar structure of 1S produces a significant bulk photovoltaic effect (0.48 V), which serves as a driving source for self‐powered CPL detection. When exposed to CPL, the fabricated single crystal‐based device shows a large response asymmetry factor (0.16) at a zero bias. Moreover, the prototypical device shows broadband photo‐responses in the wavelength range of 265–700 nm, which is attributed to the polar structure‐aroused pyroelectric effect. This study evidences how the substituted halogen group in the organic cation leads to the desired 2D chiral&polar OIHMHs which enable high‐sensitive self‐powered broadband CPL detection, offering new insights for the design of functional chiral semiconductors.",

Catalysts are pivotal in overcoming these energy barriers, enhancing reaction rates and selectivity. The strategy of atomic size misfit, which introduces structural defects like vacancies, grain boundaries, and dislocations, has gained attention as a promising approach to optimize catalytic activity. This strategy modulates atomic interactions, alters electronic structures, and enhances the reactivity of active sites, facilitating the activation of small molecules. Moreover, this approach holds significant potential for reducing environmental impact by enabling more efficient and sustainable chemical processes. However, current research on atomic size misfit remains fragmented, lacking a unified framework. A comprehensive review of this strategy is essential to consolidate its mechanisms, applications, and integration with other catalytic tuning methods such as alloying and doping. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the design of next‐generation catalysts, guiding future developments in energy conversion technologies and offering pathways for practical, scalable applications in small molecule activation.",

Therefore, developing theranostic agents with high efficacy, low drug resistance, and excellent biocompatibility for the effective treatment of drug‐resistant bacterial infections is urgently needed. Herein, a series of cationic 3,2′ and 3′,3″‐linked tri‐pyrrole (Tri‐Py) oligomers with yellow fluorescence from readily available N‐aryl‐3,4‐dihydro‐2,5‐dimethylpyrroles through a one‐pot oxidative coupling reaction is developed. These cationic Tri‐Py oligomers can be easily decorated with various functional groups, enabling modification of antibacterial activity and selectivity against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria. Compared with conventional antibiotics, Tri‐Py oligomers can effectively combat drug‐resistant bacteria and their corresponding biofilms by dual disruption of bacterial membrane and DNA, leading to low drug resistance and cross‐resistance. In addition, they demonstrated excellent in vivo antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility in mouse models of skin wounds and peritonitis induced by drug‐resistant bacteria. As a novel theranostic skeleton, Tri‐Py oligomers show promise for clinical applications in the treatment of drug‐resistant bacterial infections.",

Herein, a comprehensive interface control strategy for synthesizing rod‐like MoO2‐based materials possessing delocalization properties and exhibiting efficient Na+ storage is presented. By meticulously managing the interface conditions during the synthesis process, Co, Cu, Mg, Fe, and Ni‐polyimide‐coated molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanorods are successfully prepared, respectively, each displaying unique structural features. Specifically, the MoO2@Mo3NiS4 nanorod composite obtained through a sulfurization process based on the model of nickel‐polyimide‐coated MoO3 has a rich heterointerface and an optimized charge transfer path, thereby significantly improving the electrochemical activity. As a result, the composite electrode shows a high reversible capacity (665.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and outstanding long‐cycle stability (decay of 0.08% per cycle following 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Furthermore, through theoretical calculations, electrochemical kinetic analysis, in situ Raman, and in situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD), the specific mechanisms of interface engineering and copper current collectors affecting the electrochemical properties of MoO2 composite nanorods are deeply explored.

However, the liquid nature of Na‐K alloys also introduces significant instability, which undermines their inherent advantages and thus restricts their practical application. In this work, a semi‐solid Na‐K anode consisting of a homogeneous mixture of solid and liquid phases is developed, aiming to enhance stability while preserving the original benefits. The synergistic interaction between the solid and liquid phases enables the semi‐solid Na‐K anode to integrate the advantages of both solid and liquid anodes, thereby demonstrating excellent comprehensive performance. Notably, when matched with NaClO4 electrolyte, the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase containing KClO4 crystal layers is observed, which possesses a high modulus to inhibit dendrite growth and promote uniform deposition. As a result, full cells utilizing the semi‐solid Na‐K anode achieve a capacity retention of 89.18% after 1000 cycles at 1 C, while also demonstrating excellent rate performance, with a high capacity of 93 mAh g⁻1 at 20 C.

However, developing oral antioxidant nanozymes with stable and efficient superoxide dismutase‐catalase (SOD‐CAT) cascade activity remains challenging. Herein, montmorillonite (MMT) is employed to modulate the upward shift of the MnO2‐x d‐band center, thereby enhancing its SOD‐CAT activity and stability. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the strong interfacial interaction between MMT and MnO2‐x improves stability, reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy of MnO2‐x, and elevates the Mn d‐band center. This upward shift enhances the adsorption of key intermediates, such as *OH and *O2, in the SOD and CAT reaction pathways, which in turn lowers the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step. MnO2‐x@MMT effectively scavenges intracellular ROS through the SOD‐CAT cascade reaction. Transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the molecular mechanisms through which MnO2‐x@MMT alleviates cellular oxidative stress by activating autophagy and mitophagy pathways. Furthermore, MnO2‐x@MMT accumulates at the site of enteritis via electrostatic adsorption, exerting antioxidant therapeutic effects and facilitating the restoration of intestinal microecology. Collectively, utilizing minerals to modulate the upward shift of the antioxidant cascade nanozyme d‐band center offers novel insights for the design of materials targeting IBD.",

Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy reveals that chemical pressure enhances four‐phonon scattering and reduces optical and acoustic phonon lifetimes, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations correlate these effects with a more diffuse phonon dispersion, a broadened phonon density of states, and a distinct 3 THz spectral feature. These modifications elevate three‐ and four‐phonon scattering rates and expand the scattering phase space, reducing lattice thermal conductivity to 0.6 W m−1 K−1. The resultant peak zT of 1.3 at 873 K underscores chemical pressure as a potent phonon‐engineering strategy. Notably, it is revealed that chemical pressure predominantly mimics the “pressure” effect on phonon dynamics through comparative analysis with physically pressurized SnTe, establishing a universal strategy for thermoelectric optimization by tailoring anharmonic lattice dynamics, with implications for advancing high‐performance energy conversion materials.",

Experimental and computational results agree that the primary pathway involves double dehydrochlorination producing 1,3‐butadiene and HCl. Minor radical channels are evidenced by the detection of chloromethyl, methyl, and propargyl radicals in thermal decomposition, while chlorine radicals are absent. HZSM‐5 zeolites lower the reaction temperature and facilitate 1,3‐butadiene association reactions producing C5–C12 olefins. Further reaction steps, detected experimentally and in part isomer‐selectively, mimic previously postulated cross‐linking pathways to aromatics in PVC catalytic pyrolysis. This study identifies CC coupling as well as Diels–Alder dimerization of butadiene to yield polymethylated cyclopentadienes. These are central precursors to aromatics, for example, benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX). Ring expansion and contraction as well as transmethylation reactions are found to be dominant routes to aromatic products. The mechanisms during thermocatalytic conversion of PVC are applicable to other plastics and resemble the chemistry upon methanol‐ and methylchloride‐to‐hydrocarbon and aromatics conversion, which will inspire new strategies to enhance selectivity towards aromatics and mitigate coke formation.",

    "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)‐based dyads are emerging photocatalysts in solar‐driven hydrogen production, it is crucial to expose active sites and promote mass transfer for promoting photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, surfactant‐induced dynamic pore‐making strategy to construct noble‐metal‐free photocatalytic systems by combining the ketoenamine‐linked COFs on the surface of spinel‐structured CuCo2S4 (CuCo2S4/TpPa‐Cl2) is developed. The open hierarchically porous dyads supply rich active sites and enough channels for mass transfer. Hydrogen evolution rate of CuCo2S4/TpPa‐Cl2 is as high as 25.56 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation, which significantly surpasses those in surfactant‐free counterpart (1.63 mmol g−1 h−1) and Pt‐loaded TpPa‐Cl2 (12.38 mmol g−1 h−1). Apparent quantum efficiency at 420 nm reaches 2.24%. This study presents new protocols for constructing noble‐metal‐free COFs‐based photocatalytic systems with efficient solar energy conversion.",

    "abstract": "The critical process of fuel cells, metal‐air batteries, and electrolyzers are the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which inherently have slow kinetics demand an electrocatalyst to enhance reaction rates, performance, and durability. Nonetheless, most nonprecious catalysts undergo heat treatment, involve multiple stages, and struggle with maintaining their active sites. Herein, the active sites is intended to maintain and the synthesis costs is lowered by eliminating the need for heat treatment, leading to the polymerization of cobalt thioamide linkages for a more efficient and durable cobalt thioamide polymer synthesized through a polycondensation. This coordination polymer catalyst is supported on Ketjen Black and exhibited superior OER (Ej10 = 1.57 V) and ORR (E1/2 = 0.71 V) performances. The potential efficiency during long‐term durability of this polymer is examined by performing continuous OER operation for 260 h and exhibiting only 5.1% performance decay. For ORR durability, only 39 mV is required after 30 000 cycles in accelerated durability tests compared with the initial cycle. This study highlights the potential of cobalt‐coordinated polymer on Ketjen Black as high‐performing and durable alternatives to benchmark catalysts for OER and ORR.",

This review first elucidates the formation mechanisms of DESs and investigates how the parameter optimization of their physicochemical properties (e.g., reducibility, acidity, viscosity) enhances metal recovery rates. Following an in‐depth discussion on cathode material leaching processes using DESs, mainstream recovery methods for leaching products and cutting‐edge advancements in direct regeneration of cathode active materials are comprehensively summarized.

Therefore, innovative methods for recycling waste fiber need to be developed. This study explored the use of waste fabric as the primary raw material for the development of solar steam generators (SSGs) by harnessing abundant and affordable artificial three‐dimensional (3D) structures to deliver an efficient and cost‐effective steam‐generation solution. The limitations associated with conventional steam‐generation methods, such as high costs and the limited availability of suitable materials, were addressed by combining waste fabric with readily available artificial 3D structures. This investigation encompassed the design and fabrication of waste‐fabric‐based SSGs and evaluated performance, with an emphasis on viability, affordability, and scalability. Cotton fabric heat treated at 400 °C for 1 h exhibited a high light absorbance of 94.7%. In addition, an SSG fabricated using this cotton fabric delivered a high evaporation rate of 2.66 kg/(m2∙h). These findings contribute to the advancement of sustainable and accessible applications in a variety of domains by leveraging the potential of affordable artificial 3D structures for use in SSG applications.",

These materials exhibit broad application prospects in medical imaging, targeted drug delivery, and cancer therapy due to their exceptional magnetic properties, biocompatibility, and surface functionalization capabilities. As multifunctional imaging contrast agents, magnetic nanomaterials have been extensively employed in magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography to enhance multimodal imaging, thereby improving image resolution and diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, as targeted drug carriers, they can be guided by external magnetic fields to achieve precise drug delivery, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects. In therapeutic applications, magnetic nanomaterials have been utilized in magnetic hyperthermia therapy and photothermal therapy, where they generate localized heat via alternating magnetic fields or photothermal conversion effects, enabling tumor microenvironment modulation and precise tumor ablation. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the use of MNMs for medical imaging and therapy, with a particular focus on key technical challenges and emerging opportunities to achieve synergistic imaging and therapeutic functions.

    "abstract": "Baihuasheshecao (Scleromitrion diffusum (Willd.) R.J. Wang), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is extensively used as an ingredient in herbal teas and is a well-known folk medicine in China. However, two common adulterants, Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. and Hedyotis tenelliflora (BL.) Kuntze, belonging to the same family, are frequently mistaken as S. diffusum in folk medicine. This confusion has led to a growing concern about their identification and quality evaluation. While previous studies have demonstrated over 15 various compounds as potential chemical markers for authentication and quality control for S. diffusum, considering the selection criteria for chemical markers in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, most of these compounds do not meet the pharmacopoeial requirements. Hence, this study aims to identify an appropriate chemical marker for S. diffusum based on thin layer chromatography (TLC) identification and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quality control, in order to differentiate from any counterfeits such as H. corymbosa and H. tenelliflora. Our findings suggested for the first time that the compound (E)-6-O-(p-coumaroyl) scandoside methyl ester which is specific to S. diffusum, could serve as the chemical marker. Here, attempt was made to establish standardized protocols for TLC identification, HPLC analysis, and quantitative methodologies, adhering to Chinese pharmacopoeial standards, along with laboratory scale preparation procedures. In conclusion, our findings have provided valuable insights to the identification and quality control processes for S. diffusum, and anticipated with potential applications by the industry and regulatory authority.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are natural organic compounds that are derivatives of diphenylpropane. This group of polyphenols can be found in multiple natural sources and they exhibit a variety of biological effects. Despite the wide array of beneficial properties, the development of drugs based on these compounds is hindered by their low bioavailability. Although the substantial body of information available on strategies to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of flavonoids, this knowledge remains fragmented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to consolidate and systematize scientific data on methods for increasing the solubility and bioavailability of flavonoid compounds without changing their initial molecular structures. Throughout the investigation, it was determined that the most prevalent methods for increasing solubility and bioavailability include co-crystallization, formation of phospholipid and inclusion complexes, and the creation of nanostructures. Although there were no pronounced differences observed in enhancing solubility, the impact of these methods on pharmacokinetic parameters was established. It was found that the production of inclusion complexes and nanostructures leads to the greatest increase in the area under the pharmacokinetic curve by an average of 4.2 and 3.7 times, respectively. The least effect was noted for phytosomes, where this parameter for the modified forms exceeded the initial value by only 1.7 times. Phospholipid complexes exhibited a longer average half-elimination time than all other modifications, achieving a 2.1-fold increase. For nanostructures and micelles, a substantial increase in maximum concentration of the active substance in blood plasma was observed, reaching an average of 5.4 times for both types of modifications. During the systematization and generalization of the data, a high level of heterogeneity in solubility assessment methods across various studies was revealed, complicating comparisons of original data obtained by different researchers. The findings of this review are crucial for researchers investigating the bioavailability of flavonoid compounds and will facilitate the selection of the most effective methods based on the desired outcomes for solubility and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe similarity in appearance of poisonous and medicinal plants, such as Asarum heterotropoides (AH) and Cynanchum paniculatum (CP), poses safety risks due to frequent confusion. Since AH contains toxic ingredients, the traditional methods of olfactory and gustatory identification cannot be used to distinguish AH from CP.MethodsTo differentiate them systematically, we proposed a novel strategy based on dual electronic sensors (DES) and dual fingerprint spectra (DFS). The DES included two intelligent sensors, namely the E-nose and E-tongue, which differentiated AH and CP based on odor and taste, respectively. DFS comprised chemical fingerprint spectra obtained through LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS and electrochemical fingerprint spectra derived from the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, differentiating AH and CP by their specific and overall compositions, respectively. To our knowledge, this was the first time that the E-nose, E-tongue, LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS, and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction were combined to identify AH and CP.Results and discussion With the E-nose, we identified 25 major odor components in AH and 12 odor components in CP in a single run of 140 s. Using the E-tongue, bitterness and astringency were identified as their primary taste differences. Furthermore, 91 compounds in AH and 90 compounds in CP were identified through LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Both AH and CP shared nitrogenous compounds, volatile oils, organic acids, and lignans. However, AH uniquely contained coumarins and flavonoids, while CP contained steroidal compounds and saccharides. Notably, AH also possessed distinct toxic components, specifically aristolactam I, aristolochic acid D, and safrole. Based on the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, we obtained the electrochemical fingerprint spectra of AH and CP, thereby facilitating further distinction between these two herbs. Through the combination of electrochemical fingerprint spectra with principal component analysis (PCA) or orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), the accuracy of this method reached 100%. Through the fusion strategy, the odors, tastes, components, and electrochemical properties of AH and CP have been systematically analyzed.",

The vibrational band due to internal translation of ammonia molecule in the complex appeared at 169 and 182 cm−1 in the ground and excited state, respectively, suggesting a stronger hydrogen bonding interaction upon electronic excitation.The ground state structure of the complex was obtained using the FDIR spectrum with four bands observed at 3240, 3304, 3403, and 3433 cm−1, which showed a good agreement with the vibrational frequencies of the most stable structure.‐ The νN(1)─H frequency of the complex at 3240 cm−1 showed a significant red shift of 283 cm−1 to that of the 27DAI monomer, suggesting a strong N(1)─H⋯N interaction in the complex.

    "abstract": "AbstractA nickel‐catalyzed intramolecular acetylene hydroarylation process has been described to produce dibenzo[b,e]azepin‐6‐one derivatives in an effective, regioselective manner. This procedure demonstrates a broad substrate scope and exceptional tolerance to various functional groups. Mechanistic insights were confirmed through the use of the density functional theory method. Selective synthesized compounds were subjected to biophysical analysis such as UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, stoichiometric analysis, thermal melting, and circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis revealing strong binding affinity to exploit their interactions with human hemoglobin (Hb). Additionally, molecular docking studies provided insights into the interactions between the synthesized molecule and human Hb.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Microglia play a key role in the response to amyloid beta in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this context, the major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms change gene regulatory patterns that link back to biological function by shaping microglial transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We use RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia xenotransplantated into the brains of male APP\n              NL-G-F\n             mice. We identify widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased phagocytic capabilities and DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoform’s protective role.",

However, analyzing tissue samples under a microscope and summarizing the findings in a comprehensive pathology report is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and non-standardized. To address this problem, we present HistoGPT, a vision language model that generates pathology reports from a patient’s multiple full-resolution histology images. It is trained on 15,129 whole slide images from 6705 dermatology patients with corresponding pathology reports. The generated reports match the quality of human-written reports for common and homogeneous malignancies, as confirmed by natural language processing metrics and domain expert analysis. We evaluate HistoGPT in an international, multi-center clinical study and show that it can accurately predict tumor subtypes, tumor thickness, and tumor margins in a zero-shot fashion. Our model demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to assist pathologists in evaluating, reporting, and understanding routine dermatopathology cases.",

However, the increase in wood demand raises wood prices, and the environmental consequences of these market changes are unclear. Here we investigate the global carbon and land use impacts of adopting mass timber products, focusing on cross-laminated timber as a case study. Our results show that higher wood prices reduce the production of traditional wood products but expand productive forestland by 30.7–36.5 million hectares from 2020 to 2100 and lead to more intensive forest management. If the cumulative global cross-laminated timber production reaches 3.6 to 9.6 billion m3 by 2100, long-term carbon storage can increase by 20.3–25.2 GtCO2e, primarily in forests (16.1–17.7 GtCO2e) and in cross-laminated timber panels (4.1–8.1 GtCO2e). Including emission reductions from steel, cement, and traditional wood products, the net reduction of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions will be 25.6–39.0 GtCO2e.",

The factors contributing to this exceptional metastatic capacity have not been defined. To bridge this gap, we compare gene expression in SCLC patient samples who never experienced metastasis or relapse throughout their clinical course, versus primary SCLC patient samples from more typical patients who had metastatic disease at diagnosis. This analysis identifies FOXA2 as a transcription factor strongly associated with SCLC metastasis. Subsequent analyses in experimental models demonstrates that FOXA2 induces a fetal neuroendocrine gene expression program and promotes multi-site metastasis. Moreover, we identify ASCL1, a transcription factor known for its initiating role in SCLC tumorigenesis, as a direct binder of the FOXA2 promoter and regulator of FOXA2 expression. Taken together, these data define the ASCL1-FOXA2 axis as a critical driver of multiorgan SCLC metastasis.",

The brain uses abstract representations of the environment to generalize learned associations across sensory modalities. The circuit organization that mediates such cross-modal generalizations remains, however, unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mice can bidirectionally generalize sensorimotor task rules between touch and vision by using abstract representations of peri-personal space within the cortex. Using large-scale mapping in the dorsal cortex at single-cell resolution, we discovered multimodal neurons with congruent spatial representations within multiple associative areas of the dorsal and ventral streams. Optogenetic sensory substitution and systematic silencing of these associative areas revealed that a single area in the dorsal stream is necessary and sufficient for cross-modal generalization. Our results identify and comprehensively describe a cortical circuit organization that underlies an essential cognitive function, providing a structural and functional basis for abstract reasoning in the mammalian brain.",

Herein, we tactfully design and synthesize a ternary Co/Co3O4/CoB heterostructure that displays a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 98.8% in NORR with an NH3 yield rate of 462.18 µmol cm−2 h−1 (2.31 mol h−1 gcat\n            −1) at −0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming most of the reported NORR electrocatalysts to date. The superior NORR performance is attributed to the enhanced charge and proton transfer over the ternary Co/Co3O4/CoB heterostructure. The charge transfer between CoB and Co/Co3O4 yields electron-deficient Co and electron-rich Co3O4. The electron-deficient Co sites boost H2O dissociation to generate *H while the electron-rich low-coordination Co3O4 sites promote NO adsorption. The *H formed on electron-deficient Co sites is more favorable to transfer to electron-rich Co3O4 sites adsorbed with NO, facilitating the selective hydrogenation of NO. This study paves the way for designing and developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for electrochemical reduction of NO to NH3.",

With expanding availability of rapid whole-genome sequencing, bacterial genomics data could become a valuable tool for clinicians managing bacterial infections, driving precision medicine strategies. Here, we present a clinician-driven bacterial genomics framework that applies within-patient evolutionary analysis to identify in real-time microbial genetic changes that have an impact on treatment outcomes of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections, a strategy that is increasingly used in cancer genomics. Our approach uses a combination of bacterial genomics and antibiotic susceptibility testing to identify and track bacterial adaptive mutations that underlie microbiologically documented treatment failure (i.e. ongoing positive cultures [persistent infection] or new positive cultures after initial response [recurrent infection]). We show the potential added value of our approach to clinicians and propose a roadmap for the use of bacterial genomics to advance the management of severe bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds under mild conditions holds significant promise for industrial applications. However, the performance of photocatalysts is notably hindered by limited visible‐light absorption, low charge separation and transfer efficiency, as well as weak adsorption and activation of aromatic alcohols and O2. Herein, a boron‐doped (B‐doped) defect‐rich Fe3O4@B‐CeO2/Au photocatalyst is successfully synthesized for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) under visible light. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that boron doping not only introduces a heteroatomic energy level that acts as “intermediate springboards,” significantly broadening the absorption range of visible light, but also creates abundant oxygen vacancies and acidic sites, benefiting the adsorption and activation of O2 and BA. Furthermore, the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Au further improves the transport of interfacial photogenerated electrons. Due to these combined advantages, the selectivity of the Fe3O4@B‐CeO2/Au photocatalyst for BAD reaches 100%, and the conversion rate of BA is as high as 98.96% after 8 h of reaction under visible light. Moreover, owing to the magnetic properties of the Fe3O4 core, the photocatalyst exhibits excellent operational and cyclic stability.",

Detailed investigations, supported by density functional theory and time‐dependent density functional theory calculations, corroborate that the emission properties are strongly dictated by the neutral and the radical ancillary ligand.

Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has emerged as a sustainable alternative for NH3 production, leveraging renewable electricity to reduce nitrate (NO3−) under ambient conditions. Among various electrocatalysts, 3d‐block transition metal‐based materials have shown remarkable potential due to their low cost, electronic structures, redox flexibility, and tunable catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in 3d‐block transition metal‐based catalysts for NO3RR, highlighting catalyst design, performance metrics, mechanistic insights, and challenges. Furthermore, strategies such as alloying, single‐atom catalysts, and high‐entropy alloys are reviewed to enhance efficiency and selectivity. Finally, we discuss future perspectives on catalyst development and practical application in green NH3 production, aiming to bridge the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.",

Rapid and direct conversion of p‐nitrophenol (PNP) to p‐aminophenol (PAP) under ambient conditions at industrially relevant concentrations (115 mM) faces significant challenges such as catalytic poisoning from undesirable quinone products and sluggish kinetics due to mass‐transfer limitations leading to unsustainable energy requirements. We demonstrate a photothermal catalyst consisting of plasmonic Fe–Ru nanoparticles confined within non‐plasmonic nanostructured carbons (Fe–Ru@C10) that delivers quantitative and rapid conversion of PNP at the highest‐possible concentration (115 mM) to PAP, with excellent turnover frequency (7642 h−1) in ambient conditions, to achieve strong sustainability metrics (E‐factor: 1.3 × 10−5, PMI →1, carbon efficiency→100%, eco‐scale ∼85%). Photothermal synergism between Fe–Ru sheathed by mesoporous nanocarbon in Fe–Ru@C10 enables facile diffusional access of reactants and products to maintain fast pseudo‐first‐order kinetics (0.26 min−1) while simultaneously preventing catalyst deactivation by aggregation and poisoning. This robust and recyclable catalyst outperforms conventional catalysts, having exposed and accessible active sites while utilizing the lowest equivalent of reductant ([NaBH4]/[PNP]∼ 24.5), thereby carrying potential impact for sustainable and energy‐efficient management of environmental contaminants.",

This tailored approach enhances the electronic density of Pt nanoparticles and the distribution of acid sites, rationally tuning MSI to achieve a synergistic enhancement in activity, selectivity, and durability. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits exceptional PDH activity, achieving a 59.7 mmol·gcat⁻1·h⁻1 propylene formation rate with 94.1% selectivity and an extended operational lifetime.

    "abstract": "AbstractHigh‐entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting; however, their conventional synthesis often requires high temperatures and extreme conditions, limiting their scalability and practical application. In this study, we report a facile one‐step hydrothermal method combined with a low‐temperature reduction approach to synthesize Ni‐based HEAs (NiCoFeMoRu). During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the catalyst undergoes an in‐situ reconstruction, forming an amorphous phase interspersed among crystalline metal oxide nanoparticles. This structural transformation significantly enhances catalytic performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 357 mV at 1000 mA cm−2 and maintaining stability for over 300 h. Furthermore, a two‐electrode electrolyzer employing NiCoFeMoRu bifunctional electrodes demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm−2 and 2.47 V at 1000 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte, highlighting its efficiency for overall water splitting. The amorphous phase, induced by Ru and Mo evolution, not only improves catalytic activity but also reinforces structural integrity by facilitating self‐regulation and mitigating structural degradation. This work presents a viable strategy for designing cost‐effective, bifunctional HEA electrocatalysts, offering a pathway toward scalable and sustainable hydrogen production.",

In this work, Ru/CeO2 catalysts prepared by mechanochemical synthesis are studied in comparison with conventional impregnated catalysts to investigate the relevant parameters for catalytic ammonia decomposition. Different Ru precursors are used on CeO2 supports with varying surface areas, leading to a portfolio of catalysts with different characteristics such as CeO2 crystallite size, surface basicity, defectiveness, metal‐support interaction, reducibility, spillover effect, metal particle dispersion and dimension, and actual Ru loading. The combination of catalytic results and different characterization techniques allows for a better understanding of the importance of the different factors that affect ammonia decomposition on Ru/CeO2 catalysts, highlighting the role of particle size and Ru─H bond strength, whose relative relevance, in turn, is dependent on Ru precursor and synthesis method.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhotocatalytic hydrogen production offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, especially when combined with solar energy and biomass. Noble metals like platinum (Pt) are efficient but costly and scarce, limiting large‐scale use. Copper (Cu), with its interfacial interaction and plasmonic effects in visible light, presents a viable alternative, despite lower efficiency than Pt. This study investigates TiO₂‐based catalysts doped with low Cu concentrations (0.3%, 0.7%, and 1.1%) for hydrogen production using a photo‐thermal approach. Catalysts were synthesized via photodeposition and characterized using SEM, XRD, BET, XPS, and impedance spectroscopy. A fractional factorial design optimized reaction conditions, including Cu concentration, glycerol concentration, pH, and catalyst dosage. Results showed that 0.7% Cu provided the best balance between hydrogen evolution rate (3,847 µmol g−1 h−1) and stability. Thermal effects further enhanced production, reaching 10,421 µmol g−1 h−1 at 70 °C. The XPS analysis revealed a decrease in surface Cu concentration and the predominance of Cu⁰/Cu⁺ species, with no detection of Cu2⁺. The study concludes that photo‐thermal reactions can overcome limitations of non‐noble metal catalysts, positioning Cu as a competitive, sustainable option for hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "Niobium oxides are considered as promising anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their excellent rate‐performance. However, the practical application is hindered by their limited specific capacity. In this work, we report the first example of an all‐inorganic two‐dimensional niobate framework as anode material for LIBs. The title compound is based on antimony‐linked bivanadyl‐capped α‐Keggin polyoxoniobates as secondary building units. The compound undergoes a unique single‐crystal‐to‐single‐crystal (SCSC) transformation triggered by formic acid which results in the migration of a {VO} unit into the framework interlayer. This results in a 34% increase of the specific capacity, reaching 519 mAh g‐1 at 0.1 A g‐1, thereby surpassing most Nb‐based LIB anode materials. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the SCSC transformation exposes more Li‐binding sites in the framework, and reduces the interlayer Li‐ion diffusion barrier, leading to a capacity increase. This work presents the first example of a SCSC transformation leading to enhanced LIB performance and offers atomic‐level insights into the design of advanced LIB anode materials.",

However, the over‐hydrogenation product of ammonia is preferentially obtained under electroreduction condition. Thus, the rational design of catalysts structure is crucial to selective electrosynthesis of NH2OH. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH with emphasis on the design of catalysts structure. Electrochemical synthesis strategy we discussed is categorized by the existence form of product, including indirect electrosynthesis and direct electrosynthesis. Finally, the techno–economic analysis (TEA) of electrochemical NH2OH production and outlook of performance improvement strategies are carried out to further guide the optimization of reaction system.",

Notably, BNOF‐5, functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups, achieves exceptional reversible NH3 adsorption capacity (up to 10.0 mmol g−1 at 1 bar and 298 K), significantly surpassing that of the nonfunctionalized BNOF‐1 (5.6 mmol g−1) and the less‐functionalized BNOF‐7 (7.9 mmol g−1), thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the functionalization strategy. Remarkably, the damaged BNOF‐5 can be efficiently repaired through facile regeneration, highlighting its outstanding recyclability.

We herein report notably atom‐economic and high‐yielding biocatalytic route toward ΨTP (83% yield) and present two chemo‐enzymatic routes for producing m1ΨTP at ∼200 mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivers ΨMP (∼320 mg/mL) or Ψ (∼240 mg/mL) in 95% yield each. The acetonide‐protected ΨMP is N1‐methylated selectively using dimethyl sulfate (4 eq, 85% yield) and is subsequently converted to the triphosphate (7.3 mg/mL; 83% yield) by kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5’‐monophosphate kinase is shown for ATP‐dependent phosphorylation of (m1)ΨMP to (m1)ΨDP. The conversion to (m1)ΨTP is catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced Ψ into m1ΨTP (37% yield), the novel chemo‐enzymatic route from ΨMP offers greatly improved metrics of reaction efficiency (68% isolated yield) and sustainability (∼3‐fold less waste). The synthetic ΨTP and m1ΨTP replace UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C‐C coupling and phosphorylation toward efficient preparation of m1ΨTP.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered a highly attractive approach to reduce carbon emissions and yet encounters challenges in further converting *C1 intermediates to valuable two‐carbon (C2) products. Although copper‐based catalysts exhibit satisfactory adsorption energy for *C1 species, the symmetrical charge distribution at adjacent copper sites leads to a strong repulsive force between adsorbed *C1. Herein, asymmetric copper‐copper (CuF‐CuN) motifs with distinct adsorption behaviors have been constructed on the F‐Cu3N substrate using the in situ isostructural substitution method. Compared to the high hybridization of CuN 3d and N 2p orbitals, implanted F not only reduces the hybridization strength but also endows the CuF with delocalized unpaired electrons. Accordingly, CuF, beyond forming an isolated 3dz2‐2pz σ bond between Cu and the key *C1 intermediate (*CHO), offers additional 3dxz‐2pz π back bonding to the *CHO. With dipole interactions in the asymmetric CuF‐CuN motifs, the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent *CHO is diminished, efficiently promoting the C‐C coupling in CO2RR. Therefore, the CuF‐CuN motifs achieve an exceptional C2 selectivity of 81.5% with a partial current density of −325.9 mA cm−2 and a C2/C1 selectivity ratio of 10.47. This nuanced manipulation of atomic interactions illuminates a path to potentially groundbreaking alterations in material characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Sluggish interfacial reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases seriously hinder the practical applications of sodium‐metal batteries (SMBs) with extremely lowtemperature performance. Here, we propose an ester‐based electrolyte featuring solvent‐anion synergistic and self‐purification function, that empowers SMBs to operate stably at record‐low temperatures down to −60°C. The weakly solvating fluorinated solvent (ethyl difluoroacetate, EDFA) constructs an anion‐dominated solvated structure, where the high‐donor‐number trifluoroacetate anion (TFA−) synergistically reduces Na+ desolvation energy barrier while triggering the defluorination of EDFA. This dynamic process insitu generates inorganic components (e.g., NaF) in solid electrolyte interphase. Further, tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TMSPi) additive effectively scavenges corrosive HF species through self‐purification mechanism, ensuring durable cathode‐electrolyte interphase formation. As a result, the ester‐based SMBs render a capacity retention of 96% at −40°C (relative to the room‐temperature capacity), exceptional rate capacity (81.64 mAh g−1 at 400 mA g−1 with 70.26% retention at −40°C, which is the best rate capability at extremely low temperature compared to other ester‐based SMBs), and extended cycle ability (>300 cycles at −40°C and 100 cycles at −60°C).

    "abstract": "AbstractCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for high‐performance lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their well‐defined topologies and tunable pore architectures. However, their practical application is often limited by intrinsically sluggish charge transfer and inferior reaction kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an ionic quinoline‐linked COF (iQCOF) cathode via a one‐pot Povarov reaction with triazole ionic liquid. The iQCOF architecture achieves a synergistic enhancement by integrating π‐bridge‐induced charge delocalization to facilitate charge transport, the specific adsorption effect to gain fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and polar triazine units to enable uniform ion flux for stable interfaces. As a result, iQCOF delivers a high specific capacity of 407 mAh g−1 with 701 Wh kg−1, and exceptional rate capability (121 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) with 0.0027% per cycle over 10 000 cycles, further highlighting its potential as a high‐performance organic cathode. This work provides a convenient strategy for advanced COF‐based cathodes with fast reaction kinetics to achieve high‐rate performance, paving the way for next‐generation energy storage technologies.",

However, the reliance on weak noncovalent interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces) often leads to inefficient outer‐sphere electron transfer and inferior structural stability. Herein, we report the enantioselective immobilization of cobalt‐based molecular catalysts with chiral tetradentate ligands onto the surface of a β‐ketoenamine‐linked chiral covalent organic framework (COF) synthesized through chirality induction. The enantiomeric assembly enables axial coordination between the molecular catalysts and the chiral COF, accompanied by enamine‐to‐imine tautomerization. Leveraging efficient inner‐sphere electron transfer, the resulting composite exhibits a significantly enhanced H2 evolution rate (5.70 mmol g−1 h−1) and sustained performance without the use of precious metals. The enantiomeric assembly strategy on a COF platform demonstrates a viable approach to improve both the stability and activity of molecular catalysts, thereby expanding the design paradigm of single‐site photocatalysts.",

A primary goal of enhancing IoT infrastructure is the development of versatile RFID tags that are of compact size, high capacity, and robust security with seamless read‐write operations. Here, we report a fluorine‐19 nuclear magnetic resonance (19F NMR) based molecular encoding strategy using a fluorinated aromatics (FArs) library, termed \"FArsEER\" (Fluorinated Aromatics‐Empowered Encoding and Reading), to generate small molecule‐based ID tags (Farcodes). By leveraging the structure‐sensitive nature of 19F chemical shift, we developed a stepwise tuning strategy to precisely modulate 19F chemical shift via nuclear shielding. Through a simple one‐step synthesis, we constructed a demonstrating platform of 64 FArs with distinct 19F chemical shifts, enabling the quick generation of binary Farcodes capable of 64‐bit encoding and their facile reading and decoding with 19F NMR. Moreover, by leveraging the solvent‐dependent 19F chemical shifts and hydrolysis‐sensitive property, reversible encryption and irreversible erasure were further achieved with Farcodes for information security applications. With further advancements, Farcodes may serve as a promising small molecule‐based RFID tag for secure information storage and communication in IoT networks.",

It has proven particularly challenging to synthesize and isolate enantiomerically pure multi‐turn helicenes, and consequently, clear guidelines for the molecular design of helicenes to achieve large CPL output remain elusive. We explore the oxidative dimerization of a 2‐naphthol‐annulated hetero[13]helicene, and observe the formation of two types of structurally distinct hetero[27]helicenes, both with four helical turns, form. With CuIICl(OH)‐TMEDA as the oxidant, a symmetric dimer (bi[13]) formed, joining two helicenes with the same helicity in their keto tautomeric forms. Using CuII(OTf)₂ as the oxidant led to an unsymmetrical [27]helicenoid composed by an (M)‐ and a (P)‐enantiomer of the [13]helicene through an unusual coupling between the 1‐ and 3‐positions of the 2‐naphthol units. Structural characterization was achieved by NMR spectroscopy and single‐crystal (X‐ray or electron) diffraction analysis. The enantiomers of this [27]helicenoid were analyzed by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL measurements. The spectroscopic data were corroborated by DFT calculations, and the intense CPL output is preserved despite the presence of an (M)‐ and a (P)‐helicene in the same molecule. These [27]helicenoids are the first isolated structures that feature helical π‐systems with four helical turns.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSupramolecular polymers (SPs) driven by host–guest interactions have seen considerable advancements over the past decade, but the guest species involved are predominantly neutral molecules or cations. Strong and dependable macrocycle–anion interactions for supramolecular polymerization are highly sought after, yet the functionalities of this class of SPs featuring negatively charged backbones remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel host–guest interaction between one tetraurea macrocycle and two organophosphate anions with high affinity (association constant Ka = 1.06 × 109 M−2). It can serve as noncovalent joints to efficiently link low‐molecular‐mass polyethylene oxide (PEO) diorganophosphates into long linear SPs. Being used as an interphase layer in anode‐free lithium (Li) metal batteries, the polymer material promotes Li+ absorption and desolvation through electrostatic attractions and enables fast Li+ transport by the alternatingly arranged anionic linkages and PEO units in the polymer main chain. As a result, the SP layer homogenizes Li+ flux to achieve uniform Li deposition and significantly improves the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 full batteries by a factor of 285% with cycling stability over 200 cycles. These findings pave the way for a new family of anion‐based SPs with tunable architectures and compositions and suggest their promising applications in future batteries.",

In this study, we demonstrate that a subtle variation of the linker enables interconversion between these two conformations, the in conformer being thermodynamically the most stable in water. At basic pH (>8) the out conformer is instantly converted into the in. In contrast, at acidic pH (out monomer can be kinetically trapped and can self‐assemble into a supramolecular polymer. DFT calculations reveal that the interconversion mechanism is governed by a key hydrogen bond that locks the conformational states. Furthermore, we show that pH provides fine kinetic control over the interconversion rate and, consequently, the polymerization process. The system can then be reset toward the out conformation by using DMSO. This system stands in contrast to known transient supramolecular polymerization processes, which rely on metastable (non‐assembled) monomers. Here, it is the kinetic trapping of the assembling monomer that allows control over the lifetime of the transient supramolecular polymer via a pH‐responsive mechanism.",

Herein, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of the first all‐NHC‐protected superatomic silver cluster. This NHC‐ligand‐stabilized Ag8 cluster, characterized as Ag8K2L4(CO3)2(PF6)6 was prepared by reacting Ag2O with bisimidazolium salt H2‐L(PF6)2 under alkaline conditions in dimethylformamide via a one‐pot reaction. The results of single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis, multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and high‐resolution electrospray‐ionization (HR‐ESI) mass spectrometry revealed a cluster centered with a stable Ag8 ring. Energy decomposition analysis combined with the natural orbital for chemical valence method (EDA‐NOCV) was employed to analyze the nature of the Ag–ligand bonding, and the results suggested that the stabilization energy originated from the strong electrostatic attraction of the Ag8 ring to the NHC ligand. This work is expected to enable new applications of various NHC ligands in the formation of NHC‐protected metal clusters with attractive properties.",

These surface hydroxyls not only enhance methane chemisorption and improve charge separation, but also promote favorable interactions with molecular oxygen, collectively boosting catalytic performance. Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups lower the energy barrier for ethane formation while suppressing its over‐oxidation to CO2, resulting in significantly improved selectivity. Under ambient conditions in a flow‐reactor system, the catalyst achieves a continuous ethane production rate of 187 µmol·g−1·h−1 with approximately 97% selectivity over an extended operation period (>200 h), surpassing previous noble‐metal‐free photocatalytic systems.

However, the poor thermal stability of pentavalent vanadium [V(V)] electrolyte, manifested as V2O5 precipitation at high temperatures, leads to more critical heat management, low energy density, and even low reliability. The unclear dynamic solvation chemistry of V(V) ions brings difficulties in solving the above issues intrinsically. Herein, we investigated solvation structures and dynamic evolution of V(V) electrolyte using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and in situ liquid time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS). For the first time, we clarified the transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3, identifying the second deprotonation as the rate‐determining step. Based on this, we developed stabilization strategies through anion coordination and proton concentration control. The incorporation of HCl and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid improved the thermal stability of V(V) electrolytes remarkably. The optimized electrolyte showed no precipitation during 30‐day static tests at 50 °C, enabling stable cycling performance of 3000 cycles in VFB single cells. Further demonstration in a kW‐scale stack achieved over 1000 cycles, validating the scalability and viability. Our work provides insights into the solvation chemistry of V(V) species, paving the way to improve the reliability and energy density of a VFB system.",

    "abstract": "Precisely modulating the binding energies of intermediates through cationic engineering remains a pivotal challenge in controlling reaction pathways and improving selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). While alkali cations are widely recognized as stabilizing intermediates via electrostatic interactions, this study proposes a steric‐effect‐dominated strategy using organic quaternary ammonium cations (CnTA+) to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates. Through in‐situ attenuated total reflectance‐surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS), we elucidate that CnTA+ cations with longer alkyl chains substitute K+ more efficiently within the electrical double layer, exhibiting higher affinity for the Cu surface. This steric dominance significantly enhances the adsorption of key intermediates, steering the pathway toward formic acid (HCOOH) production. An improved Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 90% for HCOOH was achieved using octadecyl trimethyl ammonium (C18TA+) cations. This molecular engineering strategy provides a route to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates to improve the performance of CO2RR.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we prepared a resveratrol‐derived antimicrobial conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) named DY6 to enhance drug‐like properties. While DY6’s increased hydrophobicity augmented its antibacterial efficacy, it also induced significant cytotoxicity, highlighting the long‐existing dilemma of amphiphilic antimicrobials. To mitigate this issue, we employed a supramolecular strategy by complexing DY6 with sodium sulfobutyl ether β‐cyclodextrin (SβCD), forming the host–guest inclusion complex DY6@SβCD. This complex elevated the half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against L929 cells from 9.4 to over 128 µg mL−1 while maintaining a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 µg mL−1 against methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). NMR and UV–vis spectroscopic analyses confirmed that DY6’s aromatic backbone is encapsulated within the hydrophobic cavity of SβCD. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that size compatibility and electrostatic interactions are essential for stable complex formation and enhanced biocompatibility. Importantly, DY6@SβCD exhibited no resistance development over 14‐day serial passages against S. aureus, significantly outperforming norfloxacin. In biofilm‐based MRSA‐infected wound and corneal models, DY6@SβCD more effectively reduced bacterial load and inflammation compared to the last‐resort antibiotic vancomycin. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of supramolecular host–guest approach based on COEs to overcome the drug‐resistant challenges.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of antitumor agents with diverse action mechanisms has become an important focus in both fundamental research and clinical oncology, driven by the need for more effective cancer therapies. Metal complexes, with their versatile chemical, photophysical and biological properties, represent an ideal class of therapeutic and diagnostic candidates for investigating novel antitumor mechanisms. Recent advances have underscored their unique ability to trigger diverse cell death pathways. Among these, pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has garnered substantial attention because of its intrinsic link to antitumor immunity. This minireview focuses on the cutting‐edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis and elucidates their pyroptosis‐stimulating mechanisms across chemo‐, photo‐, sono‐ and targeted therapeutic modalities. By dissecting the interplay among pyroptosis induction, biological processes such as inflammasome activation and gasdermin cleavage, and subsequent immune reprogramming, we provide a thorough overview of the action mechanisms of metal complex‐based pyroptosis inducers. This understanding has inspired the rational development of novel anticancer metal complexes that can remodel the tumor microenvironment and synergize with immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractQuasi‐solid‐state lithium–sulfur batteries exhibit significant promise as safe, high‐energy electrochemical storage technology, yet their performance remains constrained by polysulfide accumulation and exacerbated shuttle effects due to sluggish redox kinetics and inefficient charge transport. Here, a dynamic migration‐pulling strategy is proposed to accelerate polysulfide redox kinetics by dynamically restructuring the solvated structure of Li+, which is validated on a GPE incorporating boronic ester dynamic covalent bonds and polar side chains (BE‐GPE). Theoretical calculations and experiments revealed that the desolvation barrier for Li+ is significantly reduced, while the ligand groups were pulled out from the solvated shell assisted by the migration of dynamic covalent bonds. Rapid charge transfer kinetics are attainable via designed electrolyte. Consequently, BE‐GPE based lithium–sulfur batteries delivered high reversible capacity of 1446 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and long‐term cycling stability with an average capacity decay of 0.04% during 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. The initial capacity at 0.5 C is up to 920 mAh g−1 and remains stable for 200 cycles at 0 °C. Successfully realized the energy storage of quasi‐solid‐state Li–S batteries under low‐temperature conditions.",

However, although it is well established that water efficiently quenches emissions of Eu(III) complexes, reported emission quantum yields of water‐soluble Eu(III) complex NPs vary significantly among studies, and the factors governing these emission properties have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we systematically investigated the emission quenching mechanisms of Eu(III) β‐diketonate complex NPs by time‐resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies. We found that the primary pathway is the interaction between coordinated and external water molecules, which strongly enhances nonradiative deactivation. Notably, coordinated water facilitates stronger interactions with the surrounding water, further promoting quenching. Additionally, we also found that aggregation causes emission quenching in Eu(III) complexes lacking phenyl groups in the β‐diketonate moiety, which have smaller molecular volumes. These findings clarify the origin of luminescence variability in Eu(III) complex NPs and provide a foundation for rational material design to enhance luminescence stability in aqueous environments.",

The reduction processes were characterized by a transition from the orthorhombic, pseudo‐hexagonal phase α‐U3O8 to the hexagonal polymorph, followed by the formation of fluorite‐type UO2+x phases. The reduction temperature and intermediate phases vary with the type of reducing agent, though they all follow a similar sequence of phases. In the presence of pure hydrogen and upon reaction with PVDF and CaH2, U3O8 transformed entirely into fluorite‐type phases UO2+x. By decreasing the chemical potential of hydrogen via its partial pressure, the behavior of U3O8 preceding the reduction to UO2+x can be switched from an orthorhombic‐to‐hexagonal phase transition followed by disproportionation to two different U3O8 phases, presumably with different oxygen content, to a continuous oxygen loss within one U3O8 phase without prior phase transition. The detailed analysis of lattice parameters and phase transformations in the course of the investigated reactions offers insights into the reduction pathways of uranium oxides, highlighting the impact of different reducing environments on the reaction pathways and final products.",

    "abstract": "The chemical modification of biomolecules is an emerging technique for studying and manipulating biological mechanisms. Among these methodologies, catalysis offers advantages over stoichiometric strategies due to its ability to enhance selectivity, e.g., spatiotemporal control, via catalytic turnover, and the modification of tyrosine recently attracts considerable attention due to its significant biological functions. However, catalyst‐controlled aromatic halogenation is challenging under near‐physiological conditions due to the lack of biocompatible catalysts, despite the potential of tyrosine bromination as an attractive biomolecular labeling technique. In this study, inspired by the bioorthogonal reactivity of cyclic olefins, we developed catalytic aromatic bromination via the transfer of a bromenium ion from olefins to aromatic substrates based on the in‐situ generation of bromiranium ions as active species. Bifunctional cyclooctenes bearing a hydroxybenzyl group efficiently catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification. The substituent effects of the catalysts primarily affected the rate of the generation of bromiranium ions, which provided the kinetics enabling light‐gated catalysis that could be activated in situ via the photochemical deprotection of the hydroxybenzyl group. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis‐base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.",

A solution process at room temperature could prepare each crystal of these molecules modified with pyridyl/phenyl. The crystal structure analysis results suggest that the difference in the pyridyl/phenyl group affects the crystal system. Solid‐state emissions were similar due to the molecular structural differences affecting only the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of the crystal exhibited amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties with the formation of population inversion. However, the pyridyl–pyridyl interactions contributed to the thermal stability of the crystal, which was stable even under high‐energy density laser irradiation. Therefore, molecular modification with the pyridyl group offers a new strategy for controlling crystal structures and rigid frameworks.",

The coordination requirements of Cu(II) enable, as demonstrated by SC‐XRD and Powder X‐ray diffraction (P‐XRD), the formation of either 1D ribbon‐like (1‐TCMSC and 1‐H2OSC) or 2D (1‐MeCNSC) extended frameworks depending on the ability of the trapped solvents to interact as hydrogen bond (HB) donor with the metal's counterion. Hirshfeld Surface (HS) analysis and in situ VT SC‐ and P‐XRD experiments reveal different interchain interactions in 1D vs 2D CPs. Solvent exchange experiments on both single crystals (SCs) and microcrystalline samples, set up to evaluate differences in the CPs’ dynamic nature, confirm the drastic effect of CP dimensionality. Additionally, an amorphous desolvated phase 1‐AmorphPwd was tested for VOC adsorption and demonstrated to display affinity for acetonitrile and nitromethane, with high selectivity for the latter, but also to have the ability to trap aromatic VOCs, capturing up to ca. 2 mmol/g of solvent. The adsorption experiments, conducted at r.t., 1 atm, and no prior activation, underscore the potential of these materials for environmental and industrial applications.

To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, and auto‐fluorescence interference, in this work, we present the rational design of an aggregation‐induced emission (AIE)‐active, deep‐red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell walls. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir‐CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed for selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism, and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir‐CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir‐CW exhibits pectin‐responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species, including metal ions, anions, amino acids, proteins, and saccharides. Notably, Ir‐CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.",

The development of techniques for selective tag cleavage with protective groups remaining is particularly important because such techniques are necessary to realize a convergent approach. Herein, we report an effective soluble support‐assisted liquid‐phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag that can be prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remaining are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which is necessary to realize a convergent approach.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeferoxamine (DFO) is widely regarded as benchmark chelator for 89Zr(IV), a commonly used PET (positron emission tomography) tracer. We have introduced a novel fluorescent coumarin derivative of DFO (DFOKC), characterized by chelating unit and fluorophore covalently linked via a lysine molecule. This design introduces a free primary amine group, which, in perspective, can be functionalized with biological vectors, potentially improving tumor tissue selectivity. Its acid‐base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV‐Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual‐mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH‐3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA‐MB‐231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favors Zr‐DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radio‐diagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBifunctional chiral N‐heterocyclic carbene ligands have been devised for enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. Based on a single C‐stereogenic center derived from chiral pool α‐aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)‐catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2‐naphthol and 1,6‐enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6‐endo‐dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl‐fused 6‐ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan‐fused products. This unusual selectivity was investigated by DFT studies, which suggested the dual role of the carbonyl group of the urea moiety: first as an H‐bond acceptor in the catalytic cycle to direct the enantioselectivity and second as a cooperative group in the hydrogen shift leading to deauration.",

    "abstract": "Previously, this study reported novel and efficient methods for the Bischler–Napieralski and Robinson–Gabriel reactions of tryptamides under microwave conditions using propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P). Furthermore, it presents the first computational study on Bischler–Napieralski reaction of Nb‐benzoyltryptamine with T3P leading to 1‐phenyl‐3,4‐dihydro‐β‐carboline. Here, it provides the detailed comparison of both T3P promoted reactions that actually lead to different products in case of a small change in the substrate. To reveal the effect of the substrate structure, density functional theory (DFT) computations have been performed on the two model tryptamides leading to three different product molecules. The computed mechanistic pathways correspond to the experimental observations and explain why the oxoalkyl tryptamide derivative selectively reacts in a Robinson–Gabriel cyclization (highest activation Gibbs free energy is 194.9 kJ mol−1) and does not give any Bischler–Napieralski product (highest activation Gibbs free energy of the pathway is 269.4 kJ mol−1). It can also be understood why high temperature is required for both reactions. It is the first occasion in the literature that these two reactions are compared by DFT calculations.",

    "abstract": "The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of an azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone in the ground and first triplet excited states has been studied within the framework of molecular electron density theory. A density functional theory‐based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40 kcal mol−1, and in the triplet state, 1.47 kcal mol−1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.",

Elastic aerogels with micro‐nanofibers as the base unit effectively solve the force‐thermal compatibility, optimized the contradiction between mechanical strength and thermal insulation performance, and solves the risk of fragile aerogel. In order to develop elastic aerogels with lower density and better thermal insulation properties. Here, the first one‐step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow‐induced spinning is reported. PMAS consists of a large number of structurally controllable microtube, resulting in ultralight density (≈50 mg cm−3), ultralow thermal conductivity (37 mW m−1·K at 25 °C), and excellent elasticity and fatigue resistance, with no significant attenuation of the maximum stress after 1000 cycles of compression at 80% strain. In addition, PMAS has temperature‐invariant dynamic mechanical stability and an operating temperature range from 77 to 573 K. These superior properties enable PMAS to be ideal choice for thermal insulation in extreme environments, thermal runaway in batteries, adsorption and gas filling. Airflow‐induced spinning fills the gap in the industrial‐scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube, while also providing a promising solution for the universal preparation of microtube structures.",

This configuration features a 99.9 wt% micro‐Si, a thin sulfide solid electrolyte (SSE), and a high‐loading NMC811. Key to these results is strategically selecting and evaluating the processing techniques, whether wet or dry, for the negative electrode, positive electrode and thin sheet‐type SSE. Excessive lithium incorporation into the silicon host, beyond the Li3.75+Si phase to form a LiSi composite, is essential to match the high capacity of the positive electrode. This SSB achieves over 1000 cycles for a 2 mAh cm−2 with ≈80% capacity retention and 94% capacity retention for 3 mAh cm−2 over 500 cycles at 25 °C. Post analysis identifies the primary capacity decay mechanisms as oxidation at the NMC/SSE interface and structural disruptions within NMC. Meanwhile, the Si electrode maintains a robust solid‐electrolyte interphase layer, minimizing capacity decay. This study highlights the necessity for improved NMC coatings, lattice oxygen stabilization, and a durable positive electrode‐electrolyte interface to improve the long‐term stability of SSBs. Strategies leading to a single‐layer pouch cell SSB exceeding 400 Wh kg−1 are developed.",

This study introduces magnetically tunable stiffness metamaterials (MTSM) that utilize a bioinspired ternary programming framework to achieve rapid and precise stiffness modulation. Drawing inspiration from biological sarcomeres, which naturally adjust stiffness through structural changes, the MTSM design employs direct ink writing, a 4D printing method, to incorporate neodymium microparticles and a styrene‐isoprene‐styrene polymer matrix. This approach enables the metamaterial to transition between three distinct stiffness states—soft, moderate, and stiff—through structural deformation controlled by magnetic torque. Integration of MTSM into a 3D array further enhances its versatility, allowing multi‐layer stiffness adjustments under magnetic fields. The MTSM array achieves an impressive 390 percent stiffness modulation range and rapid changes in response to an external magnetic field, surpassing the limitations of prior designs. These findings emphasize the potential of ternary programming in MTSM as a foundation for creating next‐generation programmable mechanical systems capable of rapid and efficient adaptability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMicroelectronic printing technology has recently emerged as a key approach in advancing pixel‐array perovskite films, particularly quasi‐2D perovskite films, to meet current scientific and technological demands. However, its further development remains hindered by the uncontrollable crystallization of perovskite during the printing process. Herein, a novel in situ heterogeneous nucleation growth approach for obtaining quasi‐2D perovskite films is demonstrated, utilizing delaminated metal–organic frameworks (i.e., layered Cd‐MOF) with an ordered structure as modulators. The inosculation of phenylethylammonium (PEA+) with layered Cd‐MOF serves as crystal nuclei, facilitating heterogeneous crystal nucleation and growth while regulating the distribution of the n‐phase. Moreover, the intercalation of the layered Cd‐MOF alleviates rigid stress, thereby eliminating defects in the printed films. The resulting quasi‐2D perovskite films exhibit an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 37.40% along with exceptional luminescent stability, making them promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications. Overall, this study highlights the significant potential of MOF‐assisted synthesis in advancing high‐performance perovskite materials through microelectronic printing technology, offering a promising pathway for the development of future optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMultiphoton microscopy (MPM) has unparalleled promise in high‐spatiotemporal bioimaging within the tissue‐transparent window of 1500 to 1700 nm, commonly referred to as the near‐infrared‐IIb (NIR‐IIb) region. However, so far, surprisingly few cases of non‐fluorescent MPM probes have been reported, and their imaging performances are relatively limited. Herein, this study introduces a highly efficient third harmonic generation (THG) probe based on semiconducting oligomer derivatives (BTICs), which exhibit strong THG responses under NIR‐IIb (1700 nm) excitation. Leveraging halogen chemistry, semiconducting oligomers with varying halogen substitutions and nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unexpectedly high THG performance across different aggregation states upon NIR‐IIb excitation. The BTICs NPs exhibit a large THG conversion efficiency (1215 × 10−84 cm6 s2 photon−2) and exceptional resistance to photobleaching. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and in vivo THG angiography capabilities of BTICs NPs are validated, achieving the visualisation of deep‐brain vasculature with unprecedented spatial resolution at a record‐high imaging depth of 1745 µm. The pioneering exploitation of semiconducting oligomer‐based THG probes establishes a new class of high‐performance materials, enabling ultra‐deep THG imaging of the brain and advancing the design of next‐generation THG imaging platforms.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPiezocatalytic two‐electron water splitting into spontaneously isolated H2 and H2O2 shows huge prospects in meeting industrial requirements. Herein, asymmetric single‐unit‐cell Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) monolayer (BON‐M) with superb force‐sensitivity are developed for pure water and seawater dissociation. The formation of a monolayer structure allows sufficient exposure of polar inherent hydroxyls and eliminates the interlayer electric field screening induced by hydrogen bonding between [Bi2O2OH] slices and [NO3] layers, resulting in larger piezoelectricity and strengthened internal electric field. It also benefits surface charge carrier decoupling and renders more favorable H2O molecules adsorption and H* desorption. Particularly, the mechanical strain can induce the in situ self‐polarization of BON‐M, which further enhances electric field intensity and reduces energy barriers of H* desorption and key intermediate *OH formation, facilitating water splitting to H2 and H2O2 kinetically and thermodynamically. An exceptional piezocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production rate up to 2071.05 and 970.27 µmol g−1 h−1 is delivered by BON‐M from pure water. It also accumulates H2 output of 12 429.68 µmol g−1 within 8 h from seawater splitting, along with mechanical‐to‐hydrogen efficiency of 0.15%. This work develops an effective strategy for exploiting high‐performance piezocatalyst by building ultrafine nanostructure enriched with inherent polar groups on the surface.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFluorescence nanoscopy of living cells employs contrast agents to reveal intrinsic correlations between mitochondrial dynamics and functions at the molecular level. However, regular mitochondrial fluorophores usually present poor photostability, low brightness, non‐specific inhibitory effects, high phototoxicity, and rapid photobleaching, which have hindered the use of these tools to capture the intricate dynamic features of mitochondria. Herein, we engineered a fluorogen‐activating protein (FAP), AmpHecy@HSA, a non‐covalent self‐assembly of HSA and amphiphilic hemicyanine (AmpHecy) fluorophore, with exceptional cell permeability, long‐lasting photostability, high brightness/fluorogenicity, and minimal phototoxicity. Crystallography and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy techniques were combined to elucidate the structural and mechanistic intricacies of fluorescence activation. These findings revealed that fluorophore photoactivation happens through the molecular conformation‐induced intramolecular charge transfer, whose kinetics is mainly determined by the hydrophobic interaction between the fluorophore and nearby amino acids. This aligns with classical molecular dynamics simulations and excited‐state conformation quantum mechanics. It was further demonstrated that AmpHecy@HSA can be used for super‐resolved images of mitochondria within living cells without apparent phototoxicity. This work expands the fluorescent toolkit based on FAP engineering for studying live‐cell mitochondrial morphology and function, advancing the fields of chemistry and biomedicine.",

This configuration demonstrates significant flexibility and tunability in the manipulation of optical, electrical, acoustic, and thermal properties. In this work, a bilayer twisted moiré elastic metasurface is presented, constructed using periodically arranged tilted and rhombic prism resonators in Lieb lattice configuration. By utilizing the twisting mechanism, the design enables systematic reconstruction of the moiré metasurface, which facilitates precise manipulation of elastic wave propagation, particularly achieving both the “all‐magic‐angle” and anisotropic transmission. The inherent band structure of the Lieb lattice plays a key role in reducing energy dissipation during wave transmission, thereby enhancing energy concentration. Furthermore, a novel phenomenon of unidirectional polariton‐like polarized waveguide mode is observed, where propagation is biased along specific directions. This study establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework throughderivation of the governing wave equations and systematic construction of band structures with corresponding dispersion relations. These findings significantly enhance the potential applications of moiré metasurfaces in elastic wave manipulation, particularly in critical technologies such as non‐destructive testing and energy harvesting.",

Encapsulation enables the formation of 1D perovskite structures with narrowband light‐emission, confined within a protective carbon nanoshell. A thorough investigation is conducted into the hybrid material's structure, linear optical properties, ultrafast carrier dynamics, and THz conductivity. The encapsulation preserves the distinct characteristics of both MAPbBr3 and SWCNTs while introducing novel optoelectronic effects, including the tuning and spectral unification of perovskite photoluminescence (PL), as well as doping‐induced modifications to SWCNT carrier relaxation dynamics. Furthermore, the observation of negative photoconductivity (NPC) response of MAPbBr3@SWCNTs thin films highlights the potential of this innovative material as a strong candidate for future energy‐efficient photodetectors, optoelectronic switches, neuromorphic computing devices, photovoltaic enhancers, and flexible electronics.",

Additionally, tuning of the surface induces secondary grain growth in the perovskite film, resulting in larger grain sizes and a denser film morphology, which account for strongly suppressed leakage currents and nonradiative recombination in PeLEDs. Consequently, devices with this interface modification achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 21.98% at a near‐infrared (NIR) emission wavelength of 800 nm and an operational half‐life (T50) of 47.3 h under a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2.

However, their progress is hindered by oxygen‐induced degradation and inherent crystal defects, challenging their efficiency and durability. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that oxyacid anions including HCOO−, HSO3−, and H2PO2− can strongly coordinate with the SnI2 precursor to form adducts. These complexes help inhibit Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation in the precursor solution, slow down the crystallization process, and ultimately improve the crystal quality of CsSnI3. Moreover, these oxyacid anions bind to the iodine vacancies (IV) and alloy within the crystal lattice, thereby preventing oxygen molecules from generating detrimental superoxide ions at these sites. Electron structure analysis and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations show that these anions not only eliminate trap states by disrupting the 5p‐5p orbitals interaction of Sn atoms near IV, but also reduce the oscillation of key energy states and weaken nonadiabatic coupling (NAC). These effects collectively contribute to the extended lifetime of charge carriers. Notably, the charge carrier lifetime in the system passivated with H2PO2− is extended by more than 15 times. Consequently, the oxyacid anions are seen to synergistically enhance the performance of Sn‐based PSCs.",

In this work, a significant association between CAF activation and disease‐free survival outcomes is established in colorectal cancer patients. Complementary biological investigations confirm the interactive dynamics between fibroblasts and colorectal cancer cells that drive CAF activation. Based on these, a fibroblast‐activation protein (FAP)‐targeted immunostimulant (called PDC) is fabricated to provoke colorectal cancer immunity through spatiotemporal regulation of CAFs. The PDC system can selectively deliver vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist calcipotriol (Cal) and photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) into CAFs via the FAP‐specific peptide. Subsequently, PpIX ablates CAFs directly through photodynamic therapy (PDT) to mitigate their immunosuppressive characteristics, while Cal reprograms the activated CAFs into a quiescent state for persistent immune regulation. Additionally, the robust PDT induces immunogenic cell death of colorectal cancer and triggers subsequent immunological cascades. Pathophysiological and immunological assessments demonstrate that PDC not only remodels the collagen matrix and inhibits primary tumor growth, but also recruits and activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to suppress lung metastases. This approach provides a complementary strategy for the spatiotemporal regulation of CAFs, offering a novel avenue for colorectal cancer immunotherapy.",

The precise modulation of the microenvironment at the electrode interface is crucial for boosting overall performance. In this work, the intra‐nanopore microenvironment at oxygen‐rich covalent organic frameworks electrode interface is precisely regulated by tuning charge density and hydrophilicity. The incorporation of hydroxyl groups manipulates the electronegativity of the electrode interface, significantly achieving strong adsorption with sodium ions as well as effectively minimizes the co‐ions expulsion effect. Besides, the electrode exhibits enhanced hydrophilicity, which promotes more sodium ion transport and enrichment. Consequently, the prepared electrode demonstrates a high salt adsorption capacity of 47.7 mg g−1 and a charge efficiency of 0.87 at a voltage of 1.2 V in a 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution. The superior performance is confirmed to originate from the synergistic mechanism of the coordination ion exchange of hydroxyl and the redox reaction of carbonyl groups.

Electronic structure modulation of metal sites through strengthening metal‐support interactions represents a plausible approach to enhance NORR yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE), primarily by facilitating NO hydrogenation and inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, a boron and nitrogen co‐doped carbon‐supported CuNi alloy (CuNi@BCN) catalyst is designed and fabricated, which achieved a high NH3 yield rate of 573.70 µmol cm−2 h−1 in a flow cell and a FE of 95.13% in an H‐cell. These newly achieved performances are outperforming the most recently developed NORR electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations and in situ tests clarify that heteroatom‐doped carbon can lead to an electron‐rich alloy and thus facilitate NO hydrogenation with efficient participation of proton (*H) and inhibition of HER. The precise modulation of the alloy's electronic structure originates from heteroatom doping, which regulates the local reaction environments and successfully strengthens the alloy‐support interaction.

One of their particularly appealing properties is related to the presence of conducting domain walls, which can be used as functional elements in the devices with electrically tunable resistance–memristors. Using a combination of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) techniques, the electrical conductivity of the head‐to‐head (H‐H) domain walls in the Al0.85Sc0.15N thin films on the n‐GaN substrate is directly demonstrated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of the Al0.85Sc0.15N films reveal that the conducting nature of these domain walls is likely related to their inclination with respect to the polar axis, resulting in polarization discontinuity at the domain junctions. On the other hand, no increased conductivity has been detected for the tail‐to‐tail (T‐T) domain walls reflecting a semiconducting nature of Al0.85Sc0.15N thin films. Modulation of the domain wall density by voltage pulses with varying amplitude or duration allows realization of multiple stable resistance states with the maximum ON/OFF ratio of over 1500.

In this study, a molecular design strategy is presented that integrates sulfur‐π (S‐π) interactions with aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) to enhance the performance of near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) photosensitizers for biomedical applications. Unlike conventional π‐π stacking, which often leads to aggregation‐caused quenching (ACQ), S‐π interactions provide directional molecular packing without significant fluorescence quenching. Four AIE molecules (P‐THX, T‐THX, TP‐THX, and TT‐THX) are synthesized with systematic phenyl‐to‐thiophene substitution to modulate S‐π interactions precisely. These interactions lower the singlet‐triplet energy gap (ΔEST), extend π‐conjugation, and facilitate intersystem crossing (ISC), thereby boosting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Single‐crystal analysis revealed that S‐π interactions create continuous electronic coupling networks with advantages over conventional π‐π stacking arrangements. The thiophene‐substituted TT‐THX exhibits superior photophysical properties, demonstrating potent photodynamic antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA). When formulated as nanoparticles, TT‐THX enables effective wound healing, underscoring the therapeutic potential of S‐π interaction‐engineered AIE photosensitizers. This study establishes a new molecular design paradigm, unlocking advanced NIR‐II phototheranostics strategies with promising applications in infection treatment, cancer therapy, and biosensing.",

Doping elements can both reduce the kinetic energy barrier for the ordering process and adjust the crystal structure to control compressive strain of surface atoms, thereby modulating the d‐band center to optimize the intrinsic activity and multifunctional catalytic properties of HEAs. This paper establishes a fundamental data‐guided strategy for efficient screening of doping elements for HEAs, based on three core parameters: melting point, atomic radius, and electronegativity. Through which, Gallium (Ga) is rapidly identified as the optimal element X in the five‐membered PtFeCoNiX HEA system. The Ga‐doped alloy demonstrates a clear L10‐type ordered structure at 600 °C, whereas the PtFeCoNi alloy failed to achieve ordering transition under the same conditions. By precisely adjusting the Ga atomic ratio, multiple catalytic properties are optimized without compromising the L10 structure. Zinc‐air battery devices offer significant improvements in all performance metrics. Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ga doping induced a downward shift of the d‐band center, confirming the accuracy of the strategy.",

In this study, a multi‐hierarchical hydrogel designed to facilitate cellular debridement and initiate a healing process in diabetic wounds is proposed. A reactive oxygen species (ROS)/glucose‐responsive hydrogel conjugated with chemokine aptamers is developed that encapsulated mannose‐modified lipid nanoparticles (mLNPs) loaded with ADAM17 siRNA (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17). This hydrogel enhanced macrophage recruitment by enriching endogenous chemokines. Additionally, it responded to the pathological microenvironment, enabling the dynamic release of mLNPs for targeted siRNA delivery to macrophages. Treatment with ADAM17 siR@mLNPs significantly enhanced macrophage efferocytosis through the MerTK‐Rac1 pathway and glycolytic reprogramming, thereby initiating the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Finally, in animal models of diabetic wounds, this therapy reduced the apoptotic burden and improved wound healing. In conclusion, macrophage‐targeted efferocytosis‐reactivation therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of diabetic wounds.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCurrently, the production of urea by photochemical routes holds significant potential. However, photocatalytic urea synthesis is significantly limited by the co‐sorption and activation of CO2, H2O, and N2 as well as C─N coupling process. Herein, Ru1 (single atom)/CeO2‐VO (containing oxygen vacancies) is synthesized by a room‐temperature photochemical strategy. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Ce3+‐VO and single atoms, Ru1/CeO2‐VO nanosheets delivered the highest urea yield rate of 13.73 µmol g−1 h−1. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the localized asymmetric structure formed by oxygen vacancies and Ru single atoms on CeO2 can generate a stronger locally polarized electric field, thereby extending the photogenerated carrier lifetime. Experimental and theoretical calculations showed that Ru site promoted N2 adsorption and optimized water dissociation, which ensured the formation of N‐containing intermediates and the supply of protons to synthesize urea. The Ce‐ VO site activated CO2 to generate *CO, and the formed *CO migrated from the site to the adjacent Ru‐VO site. Further, the synergistic action of the dual sites promotes *CO couples with *NNH to form *NCONH, eventually converting to urea. Accordingly, this work sheds insight into the design of dual sites for effective photocatalytic C─N bond coupling to synthesize urea.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDelivering highly reactive species that can break the high level of redox homeostasis and cause irreversible death to cancer cells is a potential anticancer treatment strategy, which still remains a challenge due to the inevitable leakage and dissipation during the process of delivery. In this work, a radical generation donor (KMnO4) inhabited manganese dioxide (MnO2) nano‐formulation (KM) is constructed for cancer therapy. This study has found that the laden KMnO4 steadily remains inside MnO2 and does not diffuse out within 100 days of the experiment. To avoid the depletion of KMnO4, tetradecanol (Td), a phase transition material, is applied to fill the KM (KMTd), and followed by coating cytomembrane to form the nanosystem (KMTdM). After homologous targeted gathering at tumor sites, the housed Td is melted under near‐infrared irradiation, and the KMnO4 is liberated to magnify the oxidative damage caused by MnO2‐mediated glutathione depletion, resulting in cascade oxidative damage and death to cancer cells. This work not only provides a paradigm of delivering KMnO4 for cancer cascade therapy, but also broadens application scenarios for conventional drugs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPeripheral nerve injuries, often caused by trauma and tumor resection, severely impair motor and sensory functions. While autologous nerve grafting remains the gold standard, its efficiency is hindered by limited donor tissue availability, donor site morbidity, and neuropathic pain. Tissue‐engineered nerve grafts, emerging as promising alternatives, still face challenges due to the lack of essential biochemical and biophysical cues for comprehensive nerve regeneration. This study introduces a Janus Mg2+/H2 pump conduit, constructed with a MgH2@PLGA middle layer, polycaprolactone (PCL) outer layers, and a polydopamine‐coated PCL (PCL@PDA) inner layer. The PCL provides structural support, while the MgH2@PLGA layer continuously releases Mg2+ and H2 as biochemical cues, driven by an acidic microenvironment and the MgH2‐water reaction. PDA modification of the inner layer, serving as biophysical cues, further increases cell adhesion. Mg2+ released from the conduit mitigates oxidative stress in Schwann cells and increases their expression of neurotrophic factors, while the H2 attenuates inflammation, aiding nerve regeneration. In a rat sciatic nerve defect model, the conduit shows enhanced functional, electrophysiological, and histological recovery. These findings highlight the potential of Janus Mg2+/H2 pump conduit as a promising approach for peripheral nerve defect repair by offering a conducive microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pivotal role of silicon (Si) in semiconductor technology is well‐established; however, its hexagonal diamond (hd) crystal structure remains underexplored. This study addresses the paucity of microscopic evidence concerning the formation and phase transformation behavior of hd‐Si up to 1000 °C. Utilizing instrumented nanoindentation and subsequent annealing, the hd‐Si phase is obtained from a rhombohedral (R8) and body‐centered cubic (BC8) mixture within a diamond cubic silicon (dc‐Si) wafer. In situ characterization reveals that hd‐Si undergoes a reversible phase transition to a metallic β‐tin (Sn) phase under indentation loading, reverting to an R8/BC8 mixture upon unloading, thereby providing experimental confirmation of prior theoretical predictions. Thermal stability assessments indicate that hd‐Si remains stable beyond ≈700 °C and transitions to dominantly dc‐Si at 1000 °C, with traces of hd‐Si persisting. Notably, annealing at 500 and 700 °C yields large‐area textured hd‐Si nanocrystals with slight misorientations featuring 2H, 4H, and 6H polytypes. Interestingly, the dc‐Si formed from hd‐Si upon annealing at 1000 °C also transforms to a metallic β‐Sn phase during Berkovich indentation and reverts to an R8/BC8 mixture upon unloading. This work provides critical insights into the high‐pressure phases of Si, paving the way for future studies on phase engineering and stabilization for advanced semiconductor applications and material innovations.",

This study systematically demonstrates that F‐doping improves Fe2O3‐based photoanodes through dual effects involving increasing charge carrier density through electron structure modulation and activating the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism by activating lattice oxygen and optimizing intermediate adsorption. The dual effects are strongly correlated with improved charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency across a series of Fe2O3 and (oxy)hydroxide/F‐Fe2O3 photoanodes. These dual effects are optimally integrated into the F‐NiFe/F‐FeOOH/F‐AlOOH/F‐Fe2O3 architecture, where precisely aligned hole‐trap energy levels enable exceptional performance (4.04 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, applied bias photon‐to‐current efficiency = 0.62%).

However, challenges such as difficulties in large‐scale crystal orientation alignment and weak piezoelectricity hinder their practical application. This paper proposes an innovative, simple one‐step fabrication method using mussel‐inspired dopamine (DA) molecules to synergistically prepare glycine‐based devices with exceptional piezoelectric performance. It is found that DA can induce the formation of piezoelectric β‐glycine crystals on various substrates via supramolecular interactions, achieving a maximum piezoelectric coefficient of 5.9 pC N−1 and piezoelectric voltage coefficient of 153 × 10−3 V m N−1 in DA/glycine/polydimethylsiloxane films, with significantly enhanced thermal stability (≈120 °C). Furthermore, dopamine molecules can regulate the preferential crystal plane alignment of γ‐glycine in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/glycine films, increasing their piezoelectric coefficient and voltage coefficient to 10.8 pC N−1 and 369 × 10−3 V m N−1, respectively. Using flexible glycine‐based  films, piezoelectric force biosensors are fabricated that demonstrate exceptional sensing capabilities for joint flexibility and oral occlusion contact patterns. Additionally, DA/glycine crystals and DA/PVA/glycine films exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability.

Herein, an efficient copper atom modulation strategy is developed to construct well‐designed Cu‐deficient T‐CuxS nanoparticles (Cu1.75S treated at high temperature), paired with AuPtCu nanoalloy (AuPtCu@T‐CuxS), serving as bifunctional cathode electrocatalysts to accelerate ORR/OER kinetics of LOBs. The abundant coordination unsaturated sites on the surface of T‐CuxS can be viewed as the anchoring center of AuPt, and also can be efficient catalytic sites for the ORR/OER kinetics. The internal electric field modulates the electronic structure and d‐band center of the Cu and Pt atoms, optimizes the interaction between the AuPtCu@T‐CuxS and the intermediate LiO2, regulating the growth mode of the Li2O2. As expected, LOBs based on AuPtCu@T‐CuxS catalyst delivers a minimal overpotential (0.56 V) and long‐term cyclability (590 cycles, 500 mA g−1) at 1000 mAh g−1, exceeding most state‐of‐the‐art Janus electrocatalysts.

Herein, a colorectal cancer (CRC) turn‐on nanocomposite (SHK/HCG@CuO2/HA) is developed to achieve optimal synergistic augmentation of cuproptosis in conjunction with ferroptosis. SHK/HCG@CuO2/HA decomposes in the acidic CRC tumor microenvironment, generating copper and H2O2. Simultaneously, releases shikonin (SHK), Glutathione (GSH)‐sensitive probe HCG, and copper can spontaneously assemble into positively charged nanoparticles (SHK/HCG@Cu) for facilitating deep tumor penetration. Following lysosomal rupture, SHK/HCG@Cu disintegrates due to excess GSH, releasing copper that reacts with H2S to form CuSx nanocrystals with effective NIR absorption for precise photothermal therapy (PTT) efficiency. More importantly, red fluorescence activation in HCG by GSH facilitates real‐time self‐reporting of irradiation duration during PTT. Notably, loaded SHK eliciting an anti‐Warburg effect, reprograms the energy metabolic system from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, contributing to cuproptosis sensitization. Additionally, high ROS production from the Fenton reaction in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) triggers apoptosis and increases lipid peroxide (LPO) accumulation, causing ferroptosis in tumor cells.

Nevertheless, the mechanism of such a strategy remains ambiguous, which inhibits the rational design of cathodes. Herein, the d‐p orbital hybridization descriptor induced by the strain field is proposed to substantially decipher the high‐rate property of the sulfur vacancy‐rich CoNi2S4. The concentrative atomic tensile strain obviously reduces Co‐d orbital energy level and elevates its d‐band center, then specifically boosts the degree of  orbital hybridization owing to the formation of stronger σ bonds, further facilitating the charge transfer and fast redox kinetics. Thus, the constructed CoNi2S4 with tailored sulfur vacancies (MSV‐CoNi2S4) delivers a large capacity of 352.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an exceptional rate capability with 244.4 mAh g−1 even at 200 A g−1, which is four times higher than the maximum tested current density of previously reported TMCs.

Despite the growing interest in thermochromic paper, there is a need for further development to enhance the color printing capabilities and information storage stability. Herein, a novel thermally‐triggered structural color printing with excellent environmental tolerance has been developed by integrating an inverse photonic glass (IPG) structure from the crystalline polythiourethane (PTU) polymer. The IPG structure, primarily exhibiting a white structural color opaque state, undergoes a permanent and irreversible transition to a highly transparent state upon thermal triggering. The mechanism behind it is rooted in the thermally‐triggered melting transformation of PTU during phase change process, resulting in rapid and irreversible collapse of porous structures. The stark contrast between structural color and transmittance opens up the possibility for thermal printing. Most importantly, the multilayer IPG/PSF/IPG structure, which incorporates polysulfide (PSF) microsphere arrays as color rendering layers, offers the potential for color printing. By adjusting the sizes of PSF microspheres (195, 233, and 248 nm), green, orange, and red color printing can be easily achieved.

However, the design of NMP‐SACs primarily aims at the separate adsorption of *OH and H*, while neglecting the *OH desorption, causing *OH blockage and slow kinetics. To address this, Mo2C is introduced to NMP‐SACs (e.g., Pt nanoparticles‐Pt atom, Ptn‐Pt1) by a “one‐step dual‐confinement pyrolysis” strategy for Ptn‐Pt1@Mo2C, where Pt1 precisely confined by Mo2C with Ptn remaining adjacent to Pt1@Mo2C. Experiments and calculations demonstrate that Mo2C acting as an “OH‐baton” helps overcome *OH blockage on Pt1, accelerating the separation of H* and *OH and thus promoting spontaneous alkaline water dissociation. Thus, the supported Ptn‐Pt1@Mo2C achieves a significantly lower overpotential (η10 = 24 mV) and a more than seven times higher mass activity (MA100 = 4.33 mA µg Pt⁻1) than Ptn‐Pt1 in alkaline.

    "abstract": "The accumulation of dense crystal layers on solar evaporators compromises performances by reducing light absorption efficiency and obstructing water transport channels, ultimately diminishing evaporation rate. To mitigate this issue, spatially separated crystallization sites can be engineered on the evaporator surface to disrupt salt adhesion and prevent dense layers formation. In this study, we developed a 3D column‐shaped wood evaporator (KAC‐DW) by coating delignified wood (DW) with KOH‐activated carbon (KAC). The KAC coating creates microstructured surface featuring abundant protrusions (~144 mm−2, each 20 μm in height), which effectively inhibit salt crystal adhesion. Under 1 kW m−2 solar radiation with a 15 wt% NaCl solution, the KAC‐DW evaporator achieved an impressive water evaporation rate of 8.18 kg m−2 h−1 over 96 h (0 m s−1 wind speed)—more than double the performance of uncoated DW (3.91 kg m−2 h−1). This enhancement stems from two key mechanisms: (1) the KAC protrusions prevent dense crystal layer formation, preserving open surface channels for evaporation, and (2) they promote the growth of loose salt crystals, thereby expanding the effective evaporation area and further boosting the evaporation rate.",

    "abstract": "The generation of high‐valence surface active species (such as CoOOH and NiOOH) determines the crucial oxidation rates and stabilities in the electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, a unique Ni2P/NF catalyst is designed using a chemical vapor deposition method along with a rapid reconstruction (Ni2+ → Ni3+) rate, stably achieving ≈90% FDCA yields from BHMF electron‐oxidation after 10 cycles at a formation rate of 218 μmolFDCA cm−2 h−1 (seven times higher than data in reported literature). The abundance of available electrons near the Ni‐3d Fermi level, together with the reduced NiP bond strength and the lowest electronegativity of Ni2P, accelerates surface NiOOH species formation. In addition, the electrocatalytic oxidation of BHMF offers a more stable furan‐based substrate, while also prolonging the residence time of the oxidative intermediate HMF. This mitigates humin formation, thereby enabling the synthesis of high‐purity FDCA (>99%) at high concentrations (100 mmol L−1), making it a promising approach for efficient FDCA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Ruthenium has emerged as a promising substitute for platinum towards the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR). Herein, ruthenium/carbon composites are prepared by magnetic induction heating (300 A, 10 s) of RuCl3, RuBr3 or RuI3 loaded on hollow porous carbon cages (HNC). The HNC‐RuCl3‐300A sample consists of Ru nanoparticles (dia. 1.96 nm) and abundant Cl residues, HNC‐RuBr3‐300A possesses a larger nanoparticle size (ca. 19.36 nm) and lower content of Br residues, whereas HNC‐RuI3‐300A, contains only bulk‐like Ru agglomerates with a minimal amount of I residues, due to reduced Ru‐halide bonding interactions. Among these, HNC‐RuCl3‐300A exhibits the best HER activity in alkaline media, with a low overpotential of only ‐26 mV to reach 10 mA cm‐2, even outperforming Pt/C, and can be used as the cathode catalyst for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (along with commercial RuO2 as the anode catalyst), producing 0.5 A cm−2 at 1.88 V for up to 100 h, a performance markedly better than that with Pt/C. HNC‐RuCl3‐300A also exhibits the best HOR activity, with a half‐wave potential (+18 mV) even lower than that of Pt/C (+35 mV). These activities are ascribed to the combined contributions of small Ru nanoparticles and Ru‐to‐halide charge transfer that weaken H adsorption.",

    "abstract": "Nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) has considerable potential electrode material for supercapacitors owing to its distinct physical and chemical characteristics. However, the practical applications of pristine NiCo2S4 have been limited by issues such as small specific surface area, agglomeration, and volume changes during cycling, leading to low specific capacitance/capacity and cyclic stability at high rates. Several efforts have been taken to address these challenges. Among those the design and development of NiCo2S4–graphene‐based composites have been widely investigated. This review explores the effect of NiCo2S4 architecture and its nanocomposite with graphene on the electrochemical properties. How the various preparative parameters such as synthesis methods, precursors, experimental conditions contributed to efficiently accelerating charge transport kinetics is outlined. Finally, the effect of introduction of graphene on the electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 is discussed using density functional theory (DFT). Also, machine learning (ML) models are used to analyze the specific capacitance variation with respect to different synthesis parameters, morphology, energy density, and power density. ML models identify limitations and scope of work for working on NiCo2S4/graphene composites. It is found that most influencing parameter is annealing time that can alter specific capacitance. The review outlines future research directions, challenges, and opportunities in NiCo2S4/graphene‐based supercapacitor.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs) offer significant promise for large‐scale applications due to their low cost,high safety,and sustainability,prompting researchers to address the key issues of zinc dendrite formation,anode side reactions, and cathode dissolution.Despite most current research focusing on optimizing either the anode or the cathode, achieving coordinated improvements in both electrodes is crucial for fully realizing the potential of zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs), and remains a significant challenge due to the complexity involved in balancing the performance of both electrodes. Herein, we propose a sacrificial agent‐promoted protective strategy that enhances the performance of both the anode and cathode simultaneously. Specifically, the mercapto‐containing sacrificial agent adsorbs on the Zn anode, localizing electrons around the thiol group to trigger an in‐situ transformation reaction. This reaction forms a modulation layer that optimizes Zn2+ deposition. Concurrently, the agent promotes the formation of a protective MnO2 nanoparticle shell to reduce cathode dissolution. This strategy significantly enhances the cycling stability of both the Zn||Zn and MnO2||Zn cells, achieving 4.5 and 3 times longer performance,respectively,compared to those in ZnSO4 electrolyte.This work presents a simple and efficient dual‐function approach that simultaneously stabilizes the Zn anode and suppresses Mn‐based cathode dissolution, offering a promising pathway for the practical development of AZIBs.",

    "abstract": "Glyphosate (GP) and its derivatives are present in almost all environments and suspected to induce acute and chronic kidney injuries. This public health issue is relatively underexplored. We therefore conducted an investigation on rats and tubular HK2 cells cultured for 24 h to determine whether GP’s and Roundup’s® (RU) potential renal toxicity might be related to mitochondrial respiration impairment and the increased production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in both the renal cortex and medulla (involved in filtration and reabsorption, respectively) using a high-resolution oxygraph (Oxygraph-2K, Oroboros instruments). GP alone decreased maximal uncoupled mitochondrial respiration in the medulla (−14.2%, p = 0.02). RU decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and I + II and the maximal respiratory capacity both in the renal cortex (−13.5%, p = 0.04; −20.1%, p = 0.009; and −14.7%, p = 0.08, respectively) and in the medulla for OXPHOS I + II (80.82 ± 7.88 vs. 61.03 ± 7.67 pmol/(s·mL), −24.5%, p = 0.003). Similarly, in HK2 cells, the decrease in OXPHOS CI + II was greater after RU (65.87 ± 1.30 vs. 51.82 ± 3.50 pmol/(s·mL), −21.3%, p = 0.04) compared to GP. Increased H2O2 production was mainly observed after RU in the medulla (+14.3% in OXPHOS CI + II, p = 0.04) and in HK2 cells (+19% in OXPHOS CI + II, p = 0.02). In conclusion, although the medulla might be more prone to GP-related mitochondrial damage, RU toxicity was greater in both the renal cortex and medulla and in cultured tubular HK2 cells. Enhancing mitochondrial respiration and reducing oxidative stress might favor the prevention of or reduction in such worldwide-used herbicides’ deleterious effects on the kidneys.",

    "abstract": "Wine is a popular beverage worldwide, and its consumption continues to rise, leading to waste, particularly from vine prunings and grape pomace. The aim of this study was to create a valorization pathway utilizing these waste materials. To achieve this, proximate analysis, chemical composition, ultimate analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and other physicochemical parameters for both vine prunings and grape pomace were assessed. Based on the results, vine prunings were identified as suitable for direct combustion in energy applications, and grape pomace was found to be suitable as an antioxidant in vegetable oil. Grape pomace extract showed the following results through UV-vis spectroscopy: total phenolic content of 1688.10 mg GAE/100 g, total flavonoids of 1330.39 mg catechin/100 g, and total anthocyanins of 12.61 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside/100 mg. The antioxidant capacity was measured through various assays: FRAP yielded 2179.19 mg ascorbic acid/100 g; DPPH measured 1704.41 µmol Trolox/100 g; and ABTS showed 48,271.31 µmol Trolox/100 g. The ORAC results, as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy, were 53,694.93 µmol Trolox/100 g. HPLC profiling revealed cyanidin as the main anthocyanin (26.52 mg/L) and epicatechin as the most abundant flavonoid (214.29 mg/L). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of grape pomace in sunflower oil was evaluated using OSI. It increased the oil’s stability by up to 42.5%, positioning grape pomace extracts as a source of natural antioxidants in vegetable oils.",

Interestingly, OPC endowed OPC-Au NPs with reducibility and excellent performance in terms of particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation rate, and drug loading rate. In particular, the photothermal efficiencies of OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs increased to 59.22% under the 1064 nm NIR-ΙΙ irradiation. Compared with free DOX-ss and Lipid DOX-ss, the IC50 of OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs was decreased by 91.68% and 97.60%, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of P-gp in MCF-7/ADR was significantly inhibited (decreased by 65%). The potential of proanthocyanidin remodels the pH-GSH-NIR-ΙΙ responsiveness and drug resistance of OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs for breast cancer treatment in NIR-ΙΙ photodynamic/photothermal therapy.",

    "abstract": "MoS2 has emerged as a highly promising catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its exceptional catalytic properties. However, there is a pressing need to further enhance its reactivity and integrate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) capabilities to facilitate its industrial implementation. In this context, a dual-metal doping approach presents a straightforward and effective strategy to achieve superior catalytic performance. Systematic characterization and electrochemical evaluations reveal that the synergistic effects of Co and Fe doping significantly enhance both HER and OER activities, demonstrating remarkable potential for practical applications in energy conversion and storage systems. The unique flower-like architecture of the material endows it with a substantially enlarged surface area, which significantly increases the exposure of active sites and facilitates enhanced catalytic activity. Specifically, it achieves the low overpotentials of −127 and 292 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HER and OER in alkaline media, respectively, and demonstrates excellent stability over a 10 h test. This research provides valuable insights into the development of advanced materials capable of efficiently performing both HER and OER processes, paving the way for potential applications in sustainable energy technologies.",

    "abstract": "Valerian root extracts are widely used as mild sedatives to promote sleep, with clinical studies confirming their efficacy. Their sleep-promoting effects are associated with the adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR), a key regulator of sleep through neural activity inhibition. Adenosine, a neuromodulator that accumulates during wakefulness, activates A1ARs to facilitate sleep transitions. Using advanced analytics, we detected adenosine at 0.05% in the valerian extract Ze 911, supporting direct A1AR activation in vitro. Additionally, we explored A1ARs’ allosteric sites for modulatory activity. Valerenic acid and pinoresinol, key constituents of Ze 911, were identified as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of A1ARs. Valerenic acid exhibited strong PAM activity, with high cooperativity (αβ = 4.79 for adenosine and αβ = 23.38 for CPA) and intrinsic efficacy (τB = 5.98 for adenosine and τB = 3.14 for CPA). Pinoresinol displayed weaker PAM activity, with moderate cooperativity (αβ = 3.42 for adenosine and αβ = 0.79 for CPA) and limited efficacy (τB = 0.93 for adenosine and τB = 1.66 for CPA). The allosteric modulation observed in valerian extract Ze 911 suggests a mechanism of action in which valerenic acid and pinoresinol enhance receptor activation through allosteric interactions, potentially amplifying the effects of endogenous adenosine. By targeting A1ARs’ allosteric sites, valerian extract Ze 911 offers increased therapeutic selectivity and reduced off-target effects, emphasizing its potential for managing sleep disorders.",

Notably, the cis/trans-fusion of the cycloadducts (phosphadecalones and phosphahexahydrochrysene) can be selectively controlled by fine-tuning the conditions of microwave-assisted cycloaddition reaction. The influence of temperature, time, and steric effects on cis/trans and endo/exo selectivity was examined in detail. The molecular structure, including the absolute configuration, of eight products has been determined by X-ray crystallography. These analyses further established the endo-selective nature of the cycloaddition, favoring the P=O face of the dienophile. Post-cycloaddition transformations of selected P-stereogenic phosphadecalone, such as isomerization, reduction and deoxygenation, demonstrate the synthetic versatility of the resulting products.",

    "abstract": "The development of photoactive molecules for photothermal energy storage is a focus of research in solar energy utilization technology. Azobenzene photoswitch has emerged as a promising candidate for solar energy conversion and storage due to its unique photoisomerization characteristics. Nonetheless, a majority of azobenzene-based molecular photothermal systems have a significant drawback: they depend on ultraviolet light for E-to-Z isomerization to store photon energy rather than visible light, which seriously hinders the development of azobenzene photoswitch in practical solar energy utilization applications. In this study, an azobenzene photothermal molecule that can effectively store visible-light photon energy was design and synthesized, which includes a tetra-ortho-chlorinated azo structure as the “head” part and an alkyl chain at para-position as the “tail” part. The ultraviolet–visible and 1H NMR spectrum indicated that the obtained tetra-ortho-chlorinated azobenzene photothermal molecule could effectively absorb and store photon energy under 550 nm irradiation and release the stored energy upon 430 nm light irradiation. The storage energy density of the charged azobenzene photothermal molecule was determined to be 13.50 kJ/mol through differential scanning calorimetry and 28.21 kJ/mol via density functional theory theoretical calculations. This discrepancy was ascribed to the 64% Z-isomer yield harvesting during the charging process. Furthermore, the obtained tetra-ortho-chlorinated azobenzene exhibited long-term energy storage (approximately 11 days of half-life) and cyclic stability (100 cycles). Notably, the E-isomer of tetra-ortho-chlorinated azobenzene exhibited a high degree of supercooling, which may be advantageous for use in extremely low-temperature environments.",

Among them, compound 9e exhibited significant toxicity against MCF-7/ADR cells compared to MCF-7 cells, with a 1401-fold increase, indicating its high collateral sensitivity. Meanwhile, 9e exhibited relatively lower toxicity to normal cell lines and improved solubility compared to the previous active compound, 4A93, which features a coumarin integrity core. Preliminary pharmacological studies revealed that 9e might be a potential P-glycoprotein substrate, which enters the lysosomes of MCF-7/ADR to release effective concentrations of nitric oxide, producing reactive oxygen species and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, laser confocal microscopy and Western Blot experiments showed that 9e could induce autophagy in MCF-7/ADR cells. Additionally, the anti-tumor activity of compound 9e could be inhibited by the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1. These results suggest that the remarkable antiproliferative potency of these hybrids in MCF-7/ADR may be related to multiple anticancer mechanisms. As a novel nitric oxide donor, compound 9e was used to explore the potential development of an anti-tumor candidate with special pharmacological mechanisms to overcome multidrug resistance in breast cancer.",

The influence of adsorption and desorption temperatures and the concentration of the desorption solvent (a hydroalcoholic solution) were investigated by static adsorption and desorption methods. The results of the resin comparison showed that the adsorbent XAD-7HP had the best adsorption characteristics, with an adsorption capacity of 39.8 mg ECE/g. XAD-7HP was found to be the most suitable adsorbent, and 70% ethanol was the best desorbing solvent, based on static experiments. In addition, the optimal conditions for the adsorption of flavonoids were obtained at a temperature of 30 °C, where equilibrium was reached after 80 min. The static adsorption process was well-described by a pseudo-second-order kinetics model, while the adsorption isotherm data were fitted well by the Freundlich isotherm model. Further dynamic adsorption and desorption characteristics were evaluated on a packed glass column, and it was shown that XAD-7HP could enrich the flavanol content by 5.03-fold, with a dry matter content of 456.05 mg/mL (as estimated by the degree of DP1–DP7 procyanidin polymers using ultra-pressure liquid chromatography).",

Comparing our electrochemical results to other natural products studied using this method, this work demonstrates that kaempferol is a stronger antioxidant than vitamin C, whereas caper extract has weaker antioxidant capability than olive oil. We also investigated the synergistic scavenging relationship between vitamin C and kaempferol and found it to be potent, as all the available superoxide radicals were consumed in the presence of both compounds. Such a dramatic RRDE result was observed for the first time in our laboratory. We then utilized computational Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods to establish a viable mechanism, reminiscent of that exhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes, for the scavenging behavior of kaempferol. In the enzymatic reaction, two molecules of the superoxide radical anion with the assistance of two protons are disproportioned into one molecule of hydrogen peroxide and one oxygen molecule. Our DFT results show kaempferol mimicking superoxide dismutase (SOD) action when one kaempferol molecule reacts with two superoxide radicals and two protons (which can be provided by ascorbic acid); i.e., kaempferol acts as a catalyst that is restored after a cycle of superoxide scavenging. This mechanism is consistent with our experimental RRDE results.",

While the neurotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) has been extensively studied, targeted therapies such as sunitinib (SUN) remain largely unexplored concerning this outcome. This study aimed to compare the neurotoxic effects of DOX and SUN in dopaminergic neuronal cells and to explore the involvement of oxidative stress and autophagy as potential mechanisms underlying their cytotoxicity. Human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated into a dopaminergic phenotype and exposed to clinically relevant concentrations of DOX (0.1–10 µM) and SUN (1–10 µM) for 24 or 48 h. To investigate the involvement of oxidative stress in their cytotoxicity, redox modulators [N-acetylcysteine (NAC); dimethyl fumarate (DMF); sulforaphane (SFN); and cheirolin (CH)] were tested alongside DOX and SUN for their potential protective effects. The role of autophagy in SUN-induced toxicity was assessed using 3-methyladenine (3-MA; an early-stage inhibitor); chloroquine (CH; a late-stage inhibitor); and rapamycin (RAP; an autophagy inducer). Additionally, LC3-I and LC3-II expression levels were determined. Both DOX and SUN exhibited time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization. NAC conferred partial protection against SUN toxicity but enhanced DOX’s cytotoxicity at the lowest concentration tested. DMF and SFN had dual effects, depending on the drug’s concentration, while CH exhibited a consistent protective effect towards the cytotoxicity induced by both drugs. Regarding autophagy, 3-MA partially protected against SUN-induced toxicity, whereas CLQ and RAP exacerbated it. LC3-II levels were increased in some conditions, suggesting that SUN-induced toxicity involves autophagy. This study shows that SUN, though less studied in chemobrain, has a cytotoxic profile similar to DOX, which is a known contributor to chemobrain, in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings highlight the need for further research on neuroprotective strategies targeting oxidative stress and autophagy to reduce chemobrain in cancer patients and survivors.",

In this current study, we focused on the Ugi-4CR-based one-pot synthesis of peptoids using 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol as the carbonyl component together with amine, carboxylic acid, and isocyanides. Four new peptoids—5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d—were designed and efficiently prepared in good chemical yields and were subjected to DFT investigations for their electronic behavior. These compounds have free OH, SH, and terminal triple bonds for further chemistry. In a computational analysis, the spectral data of compounds 5a–5d were juxtaposed with calculated spectral values derived from the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. The electronic excitation and orbital contributions of 5a–5d were predicted using TD-DFT calculations. A natural bond order (NBO) analysis was utilized to investigate the electronic transition of newly synthesized peptoids, focusing on their charge distribution patterns. Furthermore, MEP and NPA analyses were conducted to predict charge distribution in these compounds. The reactivity and stability of the targeted peptoids were evaluated by global reactivity descriptors, which were determined with frontier molecular orbital analysis. The DFT results revealed that compound 5c displayed marginally higher reactivity compared to 5a, 5b, and 5d, possibly due to its extended conjugation.",

    "abstract": "Rhodopsin, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) comprising the protein opsin covalently linked to the chromophore 11-cis retinal, is pivotal in visual phototransduction. Mutations in the gene encoding rhodopsin (RHO) can cause opsin misfolding or reduce its stability, resulting in retinal degenerative disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Current therapeutic strategies employing retinoid-based chaperones partially rescue the folding and trafficking of mutant rhodopsin, but are limited by inherent toxicity and instability due to photoinduced isomerization. In the present work, a pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol combined with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations was employed, leading to the identification of a novel non-retinoid opsin ligand that can potentially act as a pharmacological chaperone. Biological validation confirmed that the compound VS1 binds opsin effectively, representing a valuable starting point for structure-based optimization studies aimed at identifying new opsin stabilizers.",

Cyanobacterial neurotoxins are one cyanotoxin class that can negatively affect human health, and representatives of other cyanotoxins classes are increasingly showing neurotoxic effects. Of the various human exposure routes to cyanobacterial toxins, the significance of the airborne and inhalation route requires much greater clarity and understanding. People may be exposed to mixtures of cyanobacterial neurotoxins through the inhalation of sprays and dust, along with the potential to directly enter the central nervous system when crossing the blood-brain barrier.

To increase the solubility in water, the sulfonic group was introduced on some of the ligands, isolating them as sodium salts (NaH2L4-NaH2L7). Complexes 1–14 were isolated, fully characterized and the X-ray structures of 11, 12 and 13 were obtained. While all the ligands have no antimicrobial activity, the copper(II) complexes 1 and 4 and the nickel(II) complex 2, obtained from thiosemicarbazone ligands, showed good activity, in particular against S. aureus; these complexes were investigated in depth, calculating their respective IC50 values (4.2 μM, 3.5 μM and 61.8 μM, respectively). It should be noted that nickel(II) complex 2 does not show hemolytic activity and has a favorable SI value. While all the copper(II) complexes completely degraded the plasmid DNA in presence of H2O2, nickel(II) complex 2 cleaved the plasmid DNA leading to the formation of the relaxed nicked conformation, thus suggesting a different mechanism of action.",

Utilizing rotten apples in cidermaking is a promising technique to mitigate crop losses; nonetheless, uncertainties persist regarding the beneficial effects of damaged fruits. This study involves a thorough chemical analysis of cider produced from both healthy and scab-infected fruits to identify compositional changes caused by microbial proliferation and to assess their impact on cider quality. Apples infected by post-harvest apple scab, as opposed to uninfected apples, were employed in cidermaking. The peel microbiota was described by plate count, and next-generation sequencing-based metabarcoding methods were used to describe the peel microbiota, while HPLC and GC MS-MS were used to characterize the cider compositions. Apples infected with post-harvest scab host a specific fungal consortium with higher biodiversity, as evidenced by the Shannon evenness index, especially in the fungi kingdom. The presence of apple scab slows fermentation by up to 23%, lowers ethanol accumulation by up to 0.4%, and affects certain cider constituents: sugars, alcohols, amino acids, fatty acids, and esters. The statistical treatment of data relative to the chemical profile (PLS and PCA on the 31 compounds with VIP > 1) distinguishes ciders made from altered or safe fruits. Scab-infected apples can be valorized in the agri-food industry; however, microbiota alterations must not be underestimated. It is necessary to implement adequate mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "A novel amorphous Fe-doped manganese carbonate (a-FeMn-1) was synthesized via a facile co-precipitation method and evaluated as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in the degradation of Orange II. Among various Fe/Mn molar ratios, the 1:1 composition (a-FeMn-1) showed optimal catalytic activity, achieving 98% removal efficiency within 60 min under near-neutral pH conditions. Characterization results indicated that Fe doping effectively induced an amorphous structure and increased surface area and oxygen defects, promoting PMS activation. The system displayed broad pH applicability and resistance to Cl− and natural organic matter, while degradation was inhibited by HCO3− and PO43−. EPR and quenching experiments confirmed that surface-bound sulfate radicals (SO4•−), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and singlet oxygen (1O2) were the primary reactive species. XPS analysis further revealed the redox cycling of Fe and Mn and the involvement of defect oxygen in the PMS activation process. The catalyst also demonstrated excellent reusability over five cycles without significant loss in efficiency. This work provides insights into the rational design of amorphous bimetallic materials for sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a significant and highly pathogenic intracellular microorganism responsible for tuberculosis (TB). The global TB crisis has been exacerbated by the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Mtb strains, resulting in elevated mortality rates. Mtb MmcO exhibits scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby supporting Mtb survival. However, the molecular mechanism underlying MmcO function remains poorly understood. Herein, the hydrodynamic radius of MmcO was determined to be 5.9 ± 0.3 nm. A structural model of MmcO was predicted using AlphaFold2 and subsequently evaluated for accuracy using a Ramachandran plot and ProSA analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that substitutions H120A, H122A, H161A, or H163A nearly abolished the activity, while mutations H120R, H122R, H161R, or H163R led to minor alterations in the activity. The addition of Triton X-100 or Ca2+ significantly enhanced MmcO activity, whereas EDTA or other metal ions markedly inhibited its activity to varying extents. MmcO, a multicopper oxidase, plays a role in maintaining redox homeostasis in Mtb, a function critical for bacterial survival in host macrophages. Our study reveals that Cu2+ is essential for enzymatic activity, while Ni2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ inhibit function, likely due to improper metal coordination. Given its importance in oxidative stress resistance, MmcO presents a promising drug target for Mtb therapy. Therefore, this study offers valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic agents targeting Mtb.",

A new class of 2,4,6‐triphenylaniline‐based AIEgens are designed to alter the optoelectronic properties in different aggregated states. These 2,4,6‐triphenylaniline‐based molecules (SB1, SB2, and SB3) are self‐assembled in the aqueous medium as well as in physiological condition, creating distinct microdomains and effectively showing tunable aggregation‐ induced emission (AIE) properties. The aggregation behavior was extensively investigated using advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, by modulating the water content in acetonitrile solution. The aggregated state of SB3 emerged as the most sensitive hydrazine detector, achieving an exceptional detection limit of 0.054 µM, outperforming compounds SB1 (2.8 µM) and SB2 (2.2 µM). This attributed to hydrogen bond induced disaggregation of AIEgen aggregates, resulting in a pronounced turn‐on fluorescence response by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Not only aqueous hydrazine or hydrazine vapor detection, but also the SB3 permeate cell membrane, localize in the perinuclear area, and detect intracellular hydrazine with great specificity. This on‐site and real‐time fluorogenic hydrazine detection have prospective applications in monitoring the environment and biomedical imaging.",

One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here we observed emergent anyonic correlations in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, resulting from the phenomenon of spin–charge separation8–10. A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution11–14, a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons15.

Anthracyclines induce their potent anti-cancer effects primarily via TOP2A, but at the same time they induce a dose limiting cardiotoxicity through TOP2B. Here we describe the development of the obex class of TOP2 inhibitors that bind to a previously unidentified druggable pocket in the TOP2 ATPase domain to act as allosteric catalytic inhibitors by locking the ATPase domain conformation with the capability of isoform-selective inhibition. Through rational drug design we have developed topobexin, which interacts with residues that differ between TOP2A and TOP2B to provide inhibition that is both selective for TOP2B and superior to dexrazoxane. Topobexin is a potent protectant against chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity in an animal model. This demonstration of TOP2 isoform-specific inhibition underscores the broader potential to improve drug specificity and minimize adverse effects in various medical treatments.",

Through assessment of xenograft-derived 3D prostate cancer models and cell lines we find that tumors with RB1 loss are sensitive to BCL-XL inhibition. In parallel, drug screening demonstrates that disruption of nucleotide pools by agents including thymidylate synthase inhibitors sensitizes to BCL-XL inhibition, together indicating that replication stress increases dependence on BCL-XL. Mechanistically we establish that replication stress sensitizes to BCL-XL inhibition through TP53/CDKN1A-dependent suppression of BIRC5 expression. Therapy with a BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor (navitoclax) in combination with thymidylate synthase inhibitors (raltitrexed or capecitabine) causes marked and prolonged tumor regression in prostate and breast cancer xenograft models. These findings indicate that BCL-XL inhibitors may be effective as single agents in a subset of solid tumors with RB1 loss, and that pharmacological induction of replication stress may be a broadly applicable approach for sensitizing to BCL-XL inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Defective DNA repair and metabolic rewiring are highly intertwined in promoting the development and progression of cancer. However, the molecular players at their interface remain poorly understood. Here we show that an RNF20-HIF1α axis links the DNA damage response and metabolic reprogramming in lung cancer. We demonstrate that RNF20, which catalyzes monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1), controls Rbx1 expression and thereby the activity of the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex and HIF1α levels. Ablation of a single Rnf20 allele significantly increases the incidence of lung tumors in mice. Mechanistically, Rnf20 haploinsufficiency results in inadequate tumor suppression via the Rnf20-H2Bub1-p53 axis and induces DNA damage, cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metabolic rewiring through HIF1α-mediated RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pause release, which is independent of H2Bub1. Importantly, decreased RNF20 levels correlate with increased expression of HIF1α and its target genes, suggesting HIF1α inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for lung cancer patients with reduced RNF20 activity.",

Here we report the multiproxy analysis (ZooMS, radiocarbon, stable isotopes) of worked objects made of whale bone, and unworked whale bone fragments, found at Upper Paleolithic sites (Magdalenian) around the Bay of Biscay. Taxonomic identification using ZooMS reveals at least five species of large whales, expanding the range of known taxa whose products were utilized by humans in this period. Radiocarbon places the use of whale products ca. 20–14 ka cal BP, with a maximum diffusion and diversity at 17.5–16 ka cal BP, making it the oldest evidence of whale-bone working to our knowledge. δ13C and δ15N stable isotope values reflect taxon-specific differences in foraging behavior. The diversity and chronology of these cetacean populations attest to the richness of the marine ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay in the late Paleolithic, broadening our understanding of coastal adaptations at that time.",

A common but untested expectation is that nutrient enrichment also reduces variation in nutrient conditions among localities and selects for a smaller pool of species, causing greater diversity declines at larger than local scales and thus biotic homogenization. Here we apply a framework that links changes in species richness across scales to changes in the numbers of spatially restricted and widespread species for a standardized nutrient addition experiment across 72 grasslands on six continents. Overall, we find proportionally similar species loss at local and larger scales, suggesting similar declines of spatially restricted and widespread species, and no biotic homogenization after 4 years and up to 14 years of treatment. These patterns of diversity changes are generally consistent across species groups. Thus, nutrient enrichment poses threats to plant diversity, including for widespread species that are often critical for ecosystem functions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Microporous scaffolds facilitate solute transport and cell-material interactions, but materials allowing for spatiotemporally controlled pore formation in aqueous solutions are lacking. Here, we propose cell-guiding microporous hydrogels by photopolymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) as instructive scaffolding materials for 3D cell culture. We formulate a series of PIPS resins consisting of two ionic polymers (norbornene-functionalized polyvinyl alcohol, dextran sulfate), di-thiol linker and water-soluble photoinitiator. Before PIPS, the polymers are miscible. Upon photocrosslinking, they demix due to the increasing molecular weight and form a microporous hydrogel. The pore size is tunable in the range of 2-40 μm as a function of light intensity, polymer composition and molecular charge. Unlike conventional methods to fabricate porous hydrogels, our PIPS approach allows for in situ light-controlled pore formation in the presence of living cells. We demonstrate that RGD-functionalized microporous hydrogels support high cell viability (>95%), fast cell spreading and 3D morphogenesis. As a proof-of-concept, these hydrogels also enhance the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells, matrix mineralization and collagen secretion. Collectively, this study presents a class of cell-guiding microporous hydrogels by PIPS which may find applications in complex tissue engineering.",

Presently these solutions are limited by the controllable degrees of freedom of structured matter, hindering applications that demand photonic systems with high flexibility and reconfigurable topologies. Here we demonstrate a compound modulator that implements a synthetic tuneable arbitrary retarder array as virtual pixels derived by cascading low functionality tuneable devices, realising full dynamic control of its arbitrary elliptical axis geometry, retardance value, and induced phase. Our approach offers unprecedented functionality that is user-defined and possesses high flexibility, allowing our modulator to act as a new beam generator, analyser, and corrector, opening an exciting path to tuneable topologies of light and matter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Bacterial mating, or conjugation, was discovered nearly 80 years ago as a process transferring genes from one bacterial cell (the donor) to another (the recipient). It requires three key multiprotein complexes in the donor cell: a DNA-processing machinery called the relaxosome, a double-membrane spanning type 4 secretion system (T4SS), and an extracellular appendage termed pilus. While the near-atomic resolution structures of the T4SS and pilus are already known, that of the relaxosome has not been reported to date. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of the fully assembled relaxosome encoded by the paradigm F plasmid in two different states corresponding to distinct functional steps along the DNA processing reaction. By varying the structures of model DNAs we delineate conformational changes required to initiate conjugation. Mutational studies of the various protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction hubs suggest a complex sensitive to trigger signals, that could arise from cell-to-cell contacts with recipient cells.",

    "abstract": "Artificial lighting, essential for geotouristic purposes in subterranean sites, has facilitated the growth of colored photosynthetic organisms (lampenflora) on monumental 19th century bas‐reliefs of the Pommery Champagne cellar—a UNESCO‐protected heritage site—causing significant aesthetic and physical deterioration. To sustainably preserve these stone artworks, biocidal polyoxometalate–ionic liquids (POM‐ILs) are tested alongside the commercial biocide Preventol RI80 on three trial zones: cleaned and colonized areas of a wall and clean stone samples positioned on a testing station within the cellar. After 1 year, untreated control areas exhibit growth/regrowth of biofilms, whereas surfaces treated with POM‐ILs or Preventol RI80 remain biofilm free. Measurements of colorimetry and chlorophyll fluorescence confirm the effectiveness of both biocides in controlling photosynthetic micro‐organisms. However, confocal fluorescence microscopy highlights a reduced long‐term inhibition by Preventol RI80 compared to POM‐ILs, despite the latter being applied at lower concentrations. Metagenomic analysis further validates the performance of POM‐ILs, showing a notable decrease in microbial richness and diversity in treated areas. While both products effectively inhibit phototrophs and fungi, their efficacy against Pseudomonadota is limited, likely due to microbial adaptation via antibiotic resistance genes. This study underscores the potential of POM‐ILs as a sustainable alternative for preserving cultural heritage against microbial colonization.",

    "abstract": "In this article, a novel dispersion system is presented for consolidation and hydrophobization of degraded canvases. The dispersions are formulated by combining cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and hydrophobically modified ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (EHM) with beeswax nanoemulsions. The beeswax nanoemulsion is prepared using the Ouzo effect, a low‐energy, surfactant‐free, and spontaneous emulsification method. EHM serves as an anchor for CNC and beeswax nanoparticles on the canvas, forming a continuous film and preventing aggregation during the treatment process. Tensile tests and contact angle measurements demonstrate that the dispersions effectively strengthen the canvas and enhance its water resistance, addressing the moisture‐induced mechanical limitations observed with previous nanocellulose and polyelectrolyte consolidants. Additionally, the hydrophobicity of the beeswax‐CNC/EHM system can be adjusted by varying the beeswax content. Overall, the use of entirely green components and the straightforward preparation process makes this dispersion system highly adaptable for consolidation in cultural heritage conservation, particularly in scenarios where a hydrophobic surface is required.",

But so far, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of most these solids is still relatively low and the persistent room‐temperature phosphorescence (p‐RTP) emission is relatively weak. To improve their PLQY and p‐RTP, pressing the powder into tablets is preliminarily proven to be an effective method, but the specific mechanism has not been fully elucidated yet. Herein, carboxymethyl β‐cyclodextrin (CM‐β‐CD) is chosen as the representative to solve the problem. The results show that the PLQY and p‐RTP lifetimes of the tablet of CM‐β‐CD are improved compared to the powder. By the mechanism of clustering‐triggered emission and average packing density‐promoted emission mechanism, it is demonstrated that the enhanced molecular interactions after compression is the key reason, resulting in the formation of cluster emission centers with stronger emission capabilities. CM‐β‐CD is proven to have excellent cell imaging and anti‐counterfeiting functions.",

Two electrochemical pretreatment methods, not involving lithium overpotential deposition are in focus. These strategies are investigated in terms of passive layer growth, surface morphology evolution, composition of the formed interphases, and electrochemical performance for AFLMBs. The passive layers formed on CuCC (Cu–solid‐electrolyte interphase [SEI]) are in situ characterized by means of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with damping monitoring, which indicates that the Cu–SEIs exhibit detectable viscoelastic properties. The morphological characterization of the modified CuCCs shows highly homogeneous Cu–SEI structure with low surface roughness. The composition and physical properties of the Cu–SEI layers are correlated with the electrochemical performance of the anodes. The observed positive effect of the procedures for SEI preformation is associated with the synergistic influence of balanced inorganic–organic composition, enhanced viscoelastic properties, and homogeneous morphology of the layer. The study demonstrates the positive impact of the designed pretreatments and provides an appropriate comparison between the proposed in situ approach and the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen is considered the “future fuel” due to its zero‐carbon emissions, high gravimetric energy density, and sustainability. However, the generation of hydrogen through the splitting of water requires highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts to overcome the sluggish kinetics of each half‐cell reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Various emerging materials, including metal‐organic frameworks, 2D materials, single‐atom catalysts, high‐entropy alloys, perovskites, and MXenes, have shown great potential for OER and HER. However, the synthesis strategies for these materials vary significantly based on their unique physicochemical properties. There has been no proper study on synthesis strategies for each class of the emerging materials or synchronization of the heterostructures formed. The variety in emerging materials and available synthesis routes presents ample opportunity for further exploration of target‐oriented materials with unique properties. This review covers recent advancement of emerging materials and their synchronization with existing synthesis strategies for high electrocatalytic activities in water splitting. The review further discusses the challenges and future opportunities for utilizing such emerging materials in water splitting.",

For those molecules with a specific structural motif, the electrochemical behavior is electrochemically quasireversible, attributed to the formation of a carbanion radical stabilized on the carbonyl group. The electrochemical properties of the reversible compounds are assessed, with the lead‐performing compound extensively characterized galvanostatically to assess its candidacy for nonaqueous, high‐voltage energy storage.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping platinum‐free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for advancing fuel cell technology due to the scarcity and high cost of platinum. Palladium‐based electrocatalysts have emerged as promising alternatives, particularly in anion‐exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which offer advantages such as enhanced durability and reduced carbon corrosion compared to proton‐exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review discusses the benefits of AEMFCs over PEMFCs by focusing on ORR mechanisms and operational challenges. We then comprehensively summarize recent advancements in Pd‐based electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline media, emphasizing how optimized nanostructure morphology, alloying with other metals, or utilizing ordered Pd materials and advanced catalyst‐supports improve catalytic performance. The role of nonmetal dopants and innovative synthesis strategies in improving activity and stability is also discussed. Despite advances, the long‐term stability of Pd‐based electrocatalysts remains a critical challenge due to multiple factors. We discuss advanced approaches to overcome these issues. Finally, we provided a concise outlook and potential solutions for addressing these challenges toward achieving the DOE‐USA targets and future research directions for utilizing the use of Pd‐based ORR electrocatalysts. This review highlights the transformative potential of Pd‐based electrocatalysts and the need for continued research to achieve sustainable fuel cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          RNA replication is considered a key process in the origins of life. However, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic RNA replication cycles are impeded by the ‘strand separation problem’, a form of product inhibition arising from the extraordinary stability of RNA duplexes and their rapid reannealing kinetics. Here we show that RNA trinucleotide triphosphates can overcome this problem by binding to and kinetically trapping dissociated RNA strands in a single-stranded form, while simultaneously serving as substrates for replication by an RNA polymerase ribozyme. When combined with coupled pH and freeze–thaw cycles, this enabled exponential replication of both (+) and (−) strands of double-stranded RNAs, including a fragment of the ribozyme itself. Subjecting random RNA sequence pools to open-ended replication yielded either defined replicating RNA sequences or the gradual emergence of diverse sequence pools. The latter derived from partial ribozyme self-replication alongside generation of new RNA sequences, and their composition drifted towards hypothesized primordial codons. These results unlock broader opportunities to model primordial RNA replication.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChronic wounds are a worldwide medical challenge due to the complex and multifaceted etiologies, including bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis. Developing a comprehensive strategy integrating antibiosis and anti‐inflammation to promote revascularization and accelerate wound healing is highly desirable. Nevertheless, current therapeutic methods still face two major challenges: 1) how to combat bacterial drug resistance, 2) how to achieve spatiotemporal control over bacterial elimination and inflammation reduction. To address these issues, a novel H2S donor functionalized molecular machine (MM), ACR‐DM‐HS, was developed. It selectively binds to and disturbs the bacterial membrane through a light‐active vibronic‐driven mechanochemical action (VDA), which synergizes with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently eradicate multidrug‐resistant bacteria and biofilms, and conquers the evolution of bacterial resistance. Furthermore, it releases H2S in infected tissues to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors, promote angiogenesis, and accelerate the healing of diabetic wounds in vivo. This work provides an integrated strategy combining antibiotics and anti‐inflammation to treat with multidrug resistance bacterial‐infected chronic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Singlet oxygen (1O2) demonstrates great potential for selective wastewater detoxification, which rises the appeal to achieve a controllable, mild, and efficient generation of this reactive species for water decontamination. Herein, we present a novel cascade photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system operated via the interaction between the photoanodic and cathodic reactions without the addition of chemical precursors, realizing highly efficient 1O2 production (79.7 μmol L−1 min−1) and low energy consumption (0.052 kWh m‐3 ‐log) for antibiotic degradation. The enhanced 1O2 production is proven to benefit from the synergistic effect of multiple activation pathways under PEC excitation. With the combined action of both the built‐in electric field and external electric field, the holes in the Z‐scheme heterojunction photoanode are maximally retained, and electrons are transferred to cathode to undergo the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the production of the crucial reactive oxygen species as intermediates. The cascade reaction is initiated by electrocatalytic 2e‐ORR on the cathode and terminated by superoxide species oxidation by holes on the photoanode. The hole‐involved 1O2 generation pathway circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable process of traditional 1O2 generation. This work highlights a new PEC route for highly efficient 1O2 generation, making it a potential application in more effective environmental remediation.",

However, the alternating dominance of classical and non‐classical crystallization mechanisms, especially in multi‐component solutions (monomers, oligomers, and amorphous particles), complicates mechanistic differentiation. Herein, we unveiled the structure and composition changes of ZSM‐5 zeolite at various stages via selectively removing soluble species from the synthesis solution. We revealed that highly ordered, aluminum‐rich subcrystals serve as essential precursors, triggering rapid non‐classical aggregation growth, followed by a ripening phase dominated by single‐molecule addition. Notably, aluminum species are excluded from the aggregation growth process and reincorporated via monomer addition, accounting for the compositional heterogeneity and an aluminum‐enriched surface of the final product. Remarkably, for the first time, the fact and reason behind the preferential formation of aluminum‐rich nuclei, as well as the changes in Al species during the rapid growth and ripening stages have well been thoroughly verified and clarified through syngas to aromatics reaction and theoretical simulations. These findings provide valuable theoretical guidance for the directional synthesis of zeolite and the control of dynamic process variables.",

Here we discovered the spontaneous redispersion of CeO2‐supported Pt clusters into Pt single atoms during catalytic CO oxidation, driven by Pt‐CeO2 interaction with surface hydroxyls as the key stabilizer. This structural evolution was accompanied by deactivation, leading to inferior catalytic activity. After achieving the clear distinction of PtOx clusters and Pt single atoms, we propose a thermal aging strategy to preserve the Pt clusters against redispersion. The high‐temperature calcination at 800 °C significantly removed the surface hydroxyls of Pt/CeO2, thereby eliminating the anchoring sites for Pt redispersion and consequently preserving the Pt clusters. Moreover, the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycles were triggered, enabling the interfacial Ce3+ sites to fulfill O2 activation. Together with the enhanced CO adsorption on Pt clusters over single atoms, this redox flexibility in valence change delivered superior activity for CO oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPiezochromic materials typically exhibit pressure‐induced redshifted and quenched emission due to enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking and molecular planarization. Consequently, achieving blueshifted and enhanced emission in π‐conjugated systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report anomalous piezochromic luminescence in covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) via molecular insertion. Upon introducing methanol into the nanopores of CTFs, a blueshift in emission from 507.0 to 485.5 nm, accompanied by enhanced intensity, is observed under compression up to 1.22 GPa, distinctly contrasting the redshifted and quenched emission typically observed in compressed pristine CTFs and other crystalline porous materials (CPMs). Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that methanol can weaken the interlayer π–π stacking and intralayer conjugation of CTFs by forming weak interactions with CTFs, such as hydrogen bonding, to realize the interlayer slip and intralayer distortions of CTFs, which results in the blueshifted and enhanced emission. This strategy also proves effective with other molecular insertions, offering a general approach to achieving anomalous piezochromic luminescence in CTFs. Our findings establish molecular insertion as a robust method for engineering pressure‐responsive luminescent materials and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced optical sensors and stimuli‐responsive systems.",

Stereoselective addition of a nucleophile generates heteroatomic Z‐vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) reagents.

    "abstract": "Conventional Alkane/Water interfacial polymerization encounters significant challenges in constructing polyamide membranes with precise nanoconfinement. This requires advanced strategies that simultaneously slow the diffusion kinetics and suppress side reactions, facilitating the formation of a well‐defined pore architecture. Herein, we introduce an Alkane/Deep eutectic solvent (A‐DES) interfacial polymerization approach, allowing the preparation of ultraselective permeable polyamide membranes. The DES, acting as an anhydrous solvent, effectively prevents side reactions, while its robust hydrogen bonding network finely regulates the diffusion behavior of amine monomers and induces the assembly of oligomers, affording a polyamide membrane with uniform sub‐nanometer pores. Notably, the strong hydrogen bonding network of DES enhances the solvation of amine monomers, which further promotes the tuning of the membrane structures and functions. The polyamide membrane produced using specific DES (D‐PA) revealed an exceptional NaCl/Na2SO4 (165.8) separation selectivity, an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional polyamide membranes, coupled with impressive water permeability of up to 18.4 L m‐2 h‐1 bar‐1. This strategy offers a paradigm shift in the fabrication of ultraselective permeable polyamide membranes for advanced water purification system.",

    "abstract": "Cross‐linking mass spectrometry (XL‐MS) has become a powerful tool in structural biology for investigating protein structure, dynamics, and interactomics. However, short‐range cross‐links, defined as those connecting residues fewer than 20 positions apart, have traditionally been considered less informative and largely overlooked, leaving significant data unexplored in a systematic manner. Here, we present a system‐wide analysis of short‐range cross‐links, demonstrating their intrinsic correlation with protein secondary structure. We introduce the X‐SPAN (Cross‐link Structural Pattern Analyzer) software, which integrates publicly available XL‐MS datasets from system‐wide experiments with AlphaFold‐predicted protein structures. Our analysis reveals distinct cross‐linking patterns that reflect the spatial constraints imposed by secondary structural elements. Specifically, α‐helices exhibit periodic cross‐linking patterns consistent with their characteristic helical pitch, whereas coils and β‐strands display nearly monotonic distributions. A context‐dependent protein grammar reinforces short‐range cross‐link specificity. Short‐range cross‐links can enhance the statistical inference of secondary structures within integrative modeling workflows. Additionally, our work establishes a framework for benchmarking AlphaFold’s local prediction accuracy and provides novel quality control criteria for XL‐MS experiments. We anticipate that X‐SPAN and our short‐range cross‐link database will serve as a valuable resource for exploring local secondary structure rearrangements and their potential roles in protein function and allosteric regulation.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of conventional “always‐on” cyanine dyes into activatable NIR probes with low inherent fluorescence remains challenging, resulting in poor imaging contrast and nonspecific response in vivo. We herein report a 5‐exo‐trig cyclization strategy to create diverse activatable heptamethine cyanine probes with “zero” intrinsic background fluorescence for high‐contrast bioimaging. This intramolecular ring‐closure approach imparts a built‐in switch to regulate the fluorescence of cyanine dyes, which predominantly exist in the nonfluorescent closed‐loop form at pH over 5.0 and are not affected by environmental polarity and protein interaction, thereby reducing false‐positive fluorescent signals. Upon reaction with various biomarkers, including methylglyoxal (MGO), hydroxyl radical (·OH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), they could rapidly transform into fluorescent open‐loop structures, showing significant NIR fluorescence enhancement (up to 184‐fold). Furthermore, we extended this strategy to develop a variety of NIR‐II ATP‐activatable cyanine probes for the first time, as well as a theranostic probe 57 using host‐guest chemistry. Probe 57 not only sensitively monitored ATP levels in inflammatory bowel disease with a high signal‐to‐background ratio of 48/1, but it also precisely detected extracellular ATP in stools. This work opens a new avenue to develop stimuli‐responsive NIR cyanine probes for improving disease diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Electrophoretic‐driven micro/nanomotors (EMNMs) offer great potential for biomedical applications due to their design flexibility. However, they face challenges in high‐salt environments, where ionic quenching disrupts propulsion by collapsing the electrical double layer. This study introduces a versatile strategy by coating EMNMs with a MOF porous scaffold (ZIF‐8), which act as ion‐conductive channels that replace the electrical Debye layers and support propulsion in high‐salt solutions. Through a heteroepitaxial growth process, ZIF‐8 was precisely coated on silicon micromotors, a typical model for EMNMs, significantly enhancing their ion tolerance. By optimizing both the MOF layer and the geometry factor, the micromotors achieved effective motion in PBS solution, comparable to blood salt levels, with their ion tolerance (EI50) improving by up to 266 times compared to uncoated micromotors. Additionally, the micromotors maintained stable, controllable motion under 980 nm NIR light, even when passing through an artificial blood vessel covered with biological tissues. In addition, the ZIF‐8 coating offers drug‐loading capabilities and pH‐responsive release, along with biocompatibility, making these micromotors suitable for targeted drug delivery. This MOF coating strategy is versatile and scalable, and can be extended to other types of EMNMs, significantly enhancing their ion tolerance and unlocking new possibilities for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "The Mizoroki–Heck reaction is a powerful method for alkene formation from various molecules; however, its application has traditionally been limited to halogenated compounds. Accessing organic molecules with halogen atoms at specific positions in aliphatic systems is highly restricted, and their synthesis is extremely difficult. Therefore, achieving site‐selective alkenylation of alkyl compounds at specific positions remains challenging. This paper presents a versatile redox‐neutral method for the alkenylation of long‐chain alkyl alcohols at unactivated δ‐C(sp3)‐H sites, enabling the construction of alkenols through electrophotochemical (EPC) cerium (Ce) catalysis with free alcohols. The method demonstrates excellent substrate compatibility, facilitating the use of both primary and secondary alcohols and enabling the successful synthesis of quaternary carbon alkenols. Mechanistically, cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal that the oxidative reaction is driven by electrochemical oxidation at the anode under applied potential. Additionally, styrene boronic acid remains unoxidized during the reaction, confirming a radical addition mechanism rather than a radical‐radical coupling process. UV‐vis experiments further demonstrate that the ligand not only activates the alkene boronic acid but also functions as a base to promote the ligand exchange between alcohol and Ce(IV)−Cl species.",

This review focuses on emerging PCIMs with subnano‐/nanometer pores, particularly their design strategies and fabrication processes. First, the theorical mechanisms underlying ion transfer in confined pores is comprehensively discussed. Subsequently, the effect of a series of pore characteristics‐including size, charge, geometry, orientation, and durability on ion‐selective transport and their regulation strategies are discussed and summarized. Then, effective and universally methods for designing and adjusting PCIMs containing intrinsic pores, induced pores and composite pores are highlighted. Furthermore, the progresses of PCIM applications in emerging electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, flow batteries, Li–ion batteries, and concentration batteries are summarized. Overall, this review aims to provide a valuable reference for scholars and researchers dedicated to the study of PCIMs, thereby contributing to the ongoing progress in this field.",

Although numerous strategies have been proposed to enhance the photosensitization efficiency of dyes, significant challenges remain. Herein, we propose a novel strategy leveraging nonconjugated structural distortion to enhance triplet‐state formation. This strategy, achieved by introducing steric groups at the edges of the phenothiazine (PTZ) dye framework, notably enhances intersystem crossing (ISC) and prolongs triplet‐state lifetime. Based on this strategy, HNBS and HNBSe are synthesized, which exhibit exceptional triplet‐state quantum yields (47.2% for HNBS and 87.7% for HNBSe) and prolonged triplet‐excited‐state lifetimes (21.1 µs for HNBS and 6.3 µs for HNBSe). These values substantially exceed those of conventional dyes, such as NBS (negligible and NBSe (3.2 µs). Under ultralow‐light doses (0.45 J cm−2 in vitro, and 6 J cm−2 in vivo), these photosensitizers demonstrate robust tumor cell inhibition, highlighting their exceptional photosensitizing ability. Mechanistically, HNBS possesses lysosomal‐targeting ability, and upon light irradiation, it induces lysosomal damage, triggering pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death. These processes promote dendritic cell maturation and T‐cell differentiation, augmenting the immune response and enabling effective photoimmunotherapy.",

However, this approach is limited by solubility constraints. In this work, we introduce a dual‐anchoring strategy to regulate the solvating sites of glymes via directional atomic interactions. Specifically, Fδ‐‐Hδ+ interactions transform the Li+‐glyme coordination and induce more anion coordination within Li+ primary solvation sheath while Hδ+‐Oδ‐ interactions reduce the electron density at free oxygen sites, thus raising the oxidational potential of glyme and enhancing the overall oxidation stabiltiy of electrolytes. This strategy results in an electrolyte with exceptional compatibility with both lithium metal anode (LMA) and high‐voltage cathode, enabling LMA with an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.76%. Furthermore, the assembled LMBs exhibit extended lifespans, retaining 80% of their capacity under aggressive conditions: 834 and 370 cycles at 4.4 V and 4.5 V, respectively, for 30‐μm‐Li||2.0‐mAh cm‐2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells, and 100 cycles for anode‐free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells.

While previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3‐DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both endo (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging exo products (TON up to 1500). This approach making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium‐aryloxide catalysts allows for precise control over endo‐ and exo‐diastereoselectivity. The switch from endo‐ to exo‐selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the endo‐ and exo‐selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Brønsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps. However, they also precisely orchestrate and accelerate all accompanying transformations—reminiscent of enzymatic machineries.",

We have established a one‐pot protocol allowing for the arylation of alcohols in a single reaction vessel. Additionally, an asymmetric reaction was developed to provide enantioenriched α‐aryl and heteroaryl glutarimides in good yield and enantioselectivity.",

    "abstract": "The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysts are paramount to many renewable energy technologies. Atomically‐dispersed transition‐metal catalysts are compelling alternatives to current dominant noble‐metal catalysts, yet they often show inadequate activity for OER and insufficient durability in practical battery operations. Here, we show a rational methodology that enables single‐metal‐site catalyst to break universal adsorption‐energy scaling limitations for both OER/ORR and push bifunctional catalytic performance of transition‐metal‐dominated catalysts to an unprecedented level. Other than metal‐nitrogen coordination, the newly‐designed catalyst (namely metal‐C‐B) stabilizes atomic metals via metal‐carbon coordination and afford favorable electronic engineering via boron doping. The optimized Co‐C‐B catalyst in base exhibits a record‐low OER overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and a superior ORR half‐wave potential of 0.87 V with robust stability over 500 hours of continuous OER or ORR, which endows a rechargeable Zn‐air battery with over 6755 charge/discharge cycles. The delivered mass activities of 33941 A/gmetal for OER and 15873 A/gmetal for ORR are respectively ∼ 112/80‐fold higher than those of commercial noble‐metal counterparts. Atomically‐dispersed CoC4Bᵪ moieties were identified as unique bifunctional active centers, breaking usual scaling relations of intermediates adsorption and boosting inherent OER/ORR activities simultaneously beyond theoretical limitations for single metal site.",

    "abstract": "Two‐dimensional (2D) organic lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising next‐generation luminescent materials due to their high chemical versatility and excellent broadband light emission properties. However, their practical applications are often limited by low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by insufficient exciton confinement and extended charge‐carrier diffusion lengths within the 2D anionic layers. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel multicomponent structural engineering strategy that led to the design of [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 double perovskites (AMP = 4‐(Aminomethyl)piperidinium, X = Br‐ and I‐). These materials feature [Cu2PbX8]4‐ monolayers consisting of alternating corner‐sharing [Cu2X6]4‐ dimers and [PbX6]4‐ octahedra. Compared to the negligible luminescence observed in 2D [AMP]PbX4 analogs, the [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 compounds demonstrate strong broadband yellow‐orange emission originating from self‐trapped excitons (STEs), achieving high PLQYs exceeding 48%. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporation of [Cu2X6]4‐ dimers simultaneously enhances exciton binding energy, electron/hole effective mass, exciton confinement efficiency and STE self‐trapping depth, which are all critical factors contributing to the improved PLQY. This work successfully demonstrates a new class of 2D double perovskites with exceptional luminescent performance, advancing perovskite chemistry through a dual‐engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes both material structure and photophysical properties.",

    "abstract": "The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the substituted iron phthalocyanine, FePcOAr, exhibiting a true square‐planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents, allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, Mössbauer, FD‐FT THz‐EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S = 1 ground state with large positive, axial zero‐field splitting and a strongly anisotropic g‐tensor, with two g‐values much larger than the free electron g‐value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high‐level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin‐orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of phthalocyanines and the long standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.",

This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate Aβ peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2+) and a TDP‐43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of Aβ peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize Aβ peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting β‐sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid‐state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2+ induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of Aβ oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP‐43 variant can form stable protein complex with Aβ40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site‐specific 13C chemical shifts of the Aβ40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2+, Aβ42, and a TDP‐43 variant, revealed that Aβ40 predominantly adopts a β1‐loop‐β2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the β1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the β‐sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.",

These compounds were synthesized via the Scholl reaction, which was modulated to an intermediate stage by reducing the amount of oxidant, resulting in a sulfur‐containing [7]helicene. X‐ray crystallography analysis reveals that both S‐containing double helicenes exhibit twisted conformations consistent with the global minima identified through DFT calculations. Upon chemical oxidation with nitrosonium, these double helicenes produced π‐conjugated radical cations, whose radical nature was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These radical cations remained stable in solution when exposed to air for several weeks, as monitored by absorption spectroscopy. One of the double helicenes forms π‐stacked columns in the crystals of both neutral molecule and radical cation salt. The radical cation hexafluoroantimonate salt exhibits a room‐temperature conductivity of up to 0.16 S cm−1, attributed to the significant π–π interactions observed in its crystal structure. This study indicates the potential of double helical π‐skeletons as a versatile platform for developing resilient π‐conjugated radical cations without compromising π‐π interactions, with potential applications in organic electronics.",

These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge‐transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT cocrystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X‐ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation‐π interactions, but also Coulomb interaction between the cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D‐A fragments. Owing to the strong D‐A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manipulating electron transition dynamics.",

We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect the size, flexibility, and secondary structure of the peptide. The binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid‐β.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in‐plane motion of tetrafluoro‐1,4‐benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge‐transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction (SC XRD), solid‐state NMR, FTIR, UV‐Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short π‐stacking interactions and varied noncovalent interactions (NCI) modulating the in‐plane motion of TFBQ. 19F T₁ relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (ΔH‡) and entropies (ΔS‡), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal 4 is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal 3a depicts the highest in‐plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2 MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (5), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals 2 and 3a, displayed no significant in‐plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in‐plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe impressive efficiency and lifetime under ultrahigh luminance remain a long‐standing challenge for organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs), as conventional fluorescent, phosphorescent, and thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) systems universally suffer from accelerated bimolecular annihilation at elevated exciton densities. Recently, phosphor‐assisted TADF‐sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that synergistically integrates exciton utilization enhancement and radiative decay acceleration through breaking the singlet‐triplet spin‐flip cycles in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hosts via multiple sensitizations. The OLEDs based on pTSF achieve not only a nearly roll‐off‐free on external quantum efficiency but also a remarkable power efficiency, even when operating at ultrahigh luminance levels exceeding 100,000 cd m−2. In this review, we delve into the intricacies of pTSF technology, examining its material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes. Eventually, we critically assess the challenges in implementing pTSF for blue‐emitting OLEDs and propose strategic research directions to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe two‐electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N‐doped Nb2C nanosheets (N‐Nb2C) via a room‐temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N‐Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long‐term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring‐disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N‐Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N‐doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two‐electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Achieving efficient orange‐red emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains challenging due to hard to achieve great balance between small singlet‐triplet energy gap and high radiative decay rates. In this study, a modification site engineering strategy for secondary donors to optimize excited‐state properties for orange‐red emitters is proposed. Two isomeric emitters, ND28DBT and ND37DBT, were synthesized by introducing dibenzothiophene (DBT) units at different positions of a naphthalimide–dimethylacridine core. The theoretical analysis indicates that ND37DBT possesses a more favorable excited‐state configuration, which facilitates an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and accelerates the radiative decay rate. As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25×105 s‐1), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (22.1%) with minimal roll‐off in 100 cd m‐2. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high‐efficiency orange‐red TADF materials.",

Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te─Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi‐component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te─Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperatures, in the absence of visible light, and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride‐ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non‐synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen‐chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te‐Te > Te‐Se > Te‐S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.",

However its operating temperatures usually exceed 200 °C. In this work, an environmentally friendly and controllable electrochemical approach for constructing poly(4,4',4''‐Tris(carbazol‐9‐yl)‐triphenylamine) (PTCTA) and ZnO composite films was successfully obtained for acetic acid sensing at room temperature. The conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films of PTCTA were synthesized via an electropolymerization (EP) method using 4,4',4''‐Tris(carbazol‐9‐yl)‐triphenylamine (TCTA) molecule as a precursor. Subsequently, ZnO was deposited in situ to fabricate homogeneous PTCTA/ZnO composite films. The resulting PTCTA/ZnO composite films achieved a response value of 2.42 for 200 ppm acetic acid vapor at room temperature, which was significantly outperforming standalone PTCTA or ZnO films. This enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the porous structure, the synergistic effects of the p‐n heterojunction at the PTCTA/ZnO interface and the oxygen adsorption/desorption occurring on the ZnO surface. What’s more, PTCTA/ZnO composite films demonstrated structural stability and flexibility. The results suggested that the developed novel PTCTA/ZnO composite films showed great potential for acetic acid determination.",

Their preparation has attracted considerable attention due to their versatile applications across the pharmaceutical, food, and chemical sectors. This review elucidates the functional groups of cinnamic acid that are instrumental in the rational design of biologically active derivatives. A comprehensive representative of recent advancements in synthetic methodologies over the past five years is presented, particularly emphasizing the active scaffolds of bioactive cinnamic acid derivatives. The review provides a strategic overview of alternative synthetic routes and highlights the latest innovations, including more efficient, highly selective, and environmentally sustainable approaches. Given the widespread incorporation of the cinnamic acid framework in various therapeutic agents, this review delivers critical insights into a molecular design for hit-to-lead optimization, offering detailed synthetic strategies for diverse functional modifications. By critically examining these methodologies, the paper underscores their role in expanding the utility of cinnamic acid derivatives and addressing prevailing challenges.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology, allowing the visual observation of bioactive compounds.  While many variations of fluorescent probes that react to polar functional groups have been developed, there are few fluorescent probes that directly modify less polar compounds.  In this paper, pyrene‐containing nitrile N‐oxide (Pyrene‐NO) has been designed and synthesized as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes without a catalyst.  Pyrene‐NO shows good reactivity to a terminal alkene, a polymer methacrylate, and a natural unsaturated lipid with internal alkenes to give the corresponding cycloadducts with pyrene as the fluorescent dye.   The cycloadducts show aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) behaviors in a poor solvent.  While the adducts to 1‐hexene or polymer methacrylate show AIE in water, the adduct to castor oil as a natural glycerolipid shows AIE in MeOH.  The AIE behaviors are evidenced by the dependence of fluorescence intensity on the concentration and the enhanced fluorescence at 77 K compared with that at room temperature.  It is suggested that aggregation of the cycloadduct in the poor solvent would kinetically suppress the non‐radiative deactivation of the excited state of pyrene based on interactions with oxygen, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity.",

The molecules comprise naphtho[2,3‐c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) as a strong A, bis(4‐diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene as D, and either diphenylamine or dimethylaminophenyl as D'. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that they exhibit hybridized local and charge‐transfer (HLCT) excited states, which enable the pathways for harvesting triplet hot exciton via high‐lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) with intense NIR emissions (∼708 nm). Their asymmetrical D‐A‐D' features benefit well‐balanced hole and electron mobilities, resulting in a successful application as a non‐doped emissive layer in the OLEDs with decent performance. Particularly, the MNTFT‐based non‐doped device shows an NIR emission with a peak at 710 nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.51%, and a low turn‐on voltage of 3.2 V. These results represent a significant advancement in the development of NIR fluorescent materials and OLED devices, meeting key requirements for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Photoconvertible precursors of 2,6‐linked anthracene oligomers (trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) were synthesized through repeated Suzuki‐Miyaura cross‐coupling reactions. Upon exposure of these precursors to light at 450 nm, which correspond to the n–π* transition of diketone moieties, yellow precipitates were formed, suggesting the conversion to the corresponding anthracene oligomers from the precursors. The disappearance of 1H NMR peaks after photoirradiation indicated the formation of anthracene oligomers with less solubility. High‐resolution mass spectrometry evidently indicated the oligomer formations, and infrared spectral analysis for thin films showed the disappearance of peaks originating from the carbonyl groups, also supporting the conversion. The absorption spectra after photoirradiation indicated a red‐shift in the absorption peaks accompanying oligomer formations, suggesting an extension of the π‐conjugated system. The low solubility of the resulting anthracene oligomers in organic solvents highlights the effectiveness of this synthetic strategy using the photoconvertible precursor. This study provides a practical method to synthesize acene oligomers without the introduction of extra substituents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV—light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%–20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer‐by‐layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhotochemically driven liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators require precise arrangement and sufficiently high concentration of photoswitchable molecules for effective actuation. Achieving both high photoswitch content and a high degree of molecular alignment has been challenging especially in thick samples, but is essential for future applications in soft robotics, biomedicine, and photonic technologies. In this work, this issue is addressed by combining dynamic halogen bonds with Aza–Michael addition‐based polymerization, creating azobenzene‐containing LCEs with multimodal actuation capabilities. These highly directional supramolecular interactions eliminate the need for a photo‐initiator in the LCE fabrication process, enabling control over the azobenzene content over a wide range while maintaining a high degree of molecular alignment and dynamic programming ability. The potential of this approach is demonstrated through proof‐of‐concept examples such as light‐guided rolling movement and underwater gripping, underscoring the versatility of the weak, dynamic halogen bonds in advancing the supramolecular design of multimodal soft actuators.",

However, achieving excellent stretchability in simultaneity with ultralong RTP remains challenging because most RTP polymers rely on rigid structures with inherently poor tensile properties. Herein, a stretchable, ultralong RTP polyurethane is prepared through copolymerizing a novel phosphor dihydroxy‐functionalized indolocarbazole, 4,4′‐methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate (HMDI), poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTMEG 2000), and adipic dihydrazide (AD). The phosphor is covalently bonded to the polyurethane backbone, which facilitates the stabilization of triplet excitons and achieves ultralong RTP. The obtained copolymers exhibit a maximum strain of 1400% and the longest phosphorescence lifetime of 1888 ms. Additionally, the polyurethanes exhibiting different afterglow colors are prepared by varying the molecular structure of the phosphor. Notably, the RTP polyurethane materials also display resistance to humidity and heat. This work may provide a new option for the development of stretchable, ultralong RTP materials.",

Here, the essence of polymorphic modulation of multiphase transition antiferroelectric is proposed, and its non‐ergodic relaxor phase transition nature is revealed. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics show a giant energy storage density of 23.73 J cm−3 and an excellent efficiency of 88%, which is much superior to the commensurate and incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phases and other dielectric ceramics. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramic is composed of both commensurate and incommensurate modulated ferrielectric like antiferroelectric sub‐grain regions. Under an electric field, relaxor ferroelectric and ferroelectric phases are successively derived from the incommensurate and commensurate antiferroelectric regions, constituting two distinct non‐ergodic relaxor ferroelectric states. The independent evolution of antiferroelectric short‐range to ferroelectric short‐range and ferroelectric long‐range, and their interaction are the key to the excellent energy storage performance of polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics. The findings offer a novel insight into the field‐induced phase transition in antiferroelectric, and promote the potential applications of pulse power antiferroelectric ceramic capacitors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConventional hardware neural networks (HW‐NNs) have relied on unidirectional current flow of artificial synapses, necessitating a differential pair of the synapses for weight core implementation. Here, an artificial optoelectronic synapse capable of bidirectional post‐synaptic current (IPSC) is presented, eliminating the need for differential synapse pairs. This is achieved through an asymmetric metal contact structure that induces a built‐in electric field for directional flow of photogenerated carriers, and a charge trapping/de‐trapping layer in the gate stack (h‐BN/weight control layer) that can modulate the surface potential of the semiconductor channel (WSe2) using electrical signals. This structure enables precise control over the direction and magnitude of injected charge. The device demonstrates key synaptic behaviors, such as long‐term potentiation/depression and spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity. A fabricated 3 × 2 artificial synapse array shows that the bidirectional IPSC characteristic is compatible with multiply‐accumulate operations. Finally, the feasibility of these synapses in HW‐NNs is demonstrated through training and inference simulations using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, yielding competitive recognition rates and reduced total energy consumption for updating weights of the weight core compared to unidirectional IPSC‐based systems. This approach paves the way toward more compact and energy‐efficient brain‐inspired computing systems.",

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated to generate the “tentacled” stem cells TenSCs. Their “tentacled” vesicles TenSCev, upon inheriting the biological functions of the parent cell, will possess both neural targeting capacity and pathological environment repair ability. Hence, TenSCev are utilized as functional carrier to deliver optogenetics elements for completely non‐traumatic and controllable neuron activation, while also facilitating the comprehensive restoration of the pathological environment, thus effectively halted disease progression and significantly improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease or aged mice. Further, the concept of generating specialized biomaterials from differentiated stem cells as functional carriers holds the potential to broaden the applicability of various neuroregulatory techniques in the treatment of neurological disorders.",

However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type‐II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy. Here, a pH/Cathepsin‐Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo‐induce ER stress (PCANER) and type‐II ICD for cancer immunotherapy. PCANER integrates the long‐circulating properties of nanomedicines with pH/cathepsin B dual‐gated design, exhibiting excellent ER targeting with a colocalization efficacy of 83% in cancer tissues. Through directly intensifying glucose‐regulated protein 78 and calreticulin exposure, PCANER augments type‐II ICD and pyroptotic cancer cell death with high immune priming to cascade‐amplify the cancer‐immunity cycle, while the mild type‐I ICD induced by lysosome stress (PCANLy) exhibits negligible antitumor efficacy. By leveraging the spatiotemporal subcellular organelle targeting of PCAN technology, this study achieves precise tuning of the type of ICD and cellular pyroptosis‐based cancer therapy.

However, the synthesis of single‐crystal TMP, which is essential for elucidating intrinsic properties, remains challenging owing to the lack of efficient methods, low yields, and lengthy processes. This study presents the synthesis of facet‐controlled molybdenum phosphide (MoP) single crystals using a liquid‐metal‐assisted chemical vapor deposition method. By adjusting the synthesis temperature, two distinct MoP morphologies are created: nanoplates dominated by (0001) facets and pillars dominated by  facets. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the MoP pillars outperform nanoplates in the two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction, achieving over 92% selectivity for H2O2 production and significantly higher kinetic current density. Long‐term stability tests confirm that the MoP pillars maintain a high Faradaic efficiency (>90%) and stable electrosynthesis over 80 h of continuous operation, highlighting their robustness. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the  facets of the pillars enhance catalytic activity by reducing the OOH adsorption strength, thereby lowering the overpotential. This study underscores the importance of facet engineering in optimizing catalytic performance and provides a pathway for designing advanced TMP‐based materials for energy and environmental applications.",

Despite the broad diversity of 2D materials, most integration efforts have focused on homo/hetero‐structural stacking and Janus structures. In this paper, we introduce “glaphene”—a hybrid of two fundamentally different materials: 2D silica glass and graphene. We propose a metastable hybrid structure based on first‐principles calculations, synthesize it via scalable liquid precursor‐based vapor‐phase growth, and chemically validate the interlayer structure and hybridization using extensive optical and electron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and atomic‐resolution electron microscopy. Using probe microscopy, we reveal that electronic cloud redistribution at the interface—beyond conventional van der Waals interactions—drives interlayer hybridization via a strong electronic proximity effect. By reconstructing the energy level diagram of glaphene through both theory and experiment, we show that the combination of semi‐metallic graphene (Eg≈0 eV) and insulating 2D silica glass (Eg, exp≈8.2 eV, Eg, th≈7 eV) results in a semiconducting “glaphene” (Eg, exp≈3.6 eV, Eg, th≈4 eV) formed through out‐of‐plane pz hybridization.

While recent advances in two‐dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic and ferroelectric materials have sparked significant interest, achieving reliable and nonvolatile electrical modulation of magnetism at room temperature within vdW multiferroic heterostructures remains a substantial challenge. Here, this study demonstrates robust, reproducible, and nonvolatile electrical control of ferromagnetism in Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 multiferroic heterostructures under ambient conditions. The modulation is evidenced macroscopically by reshaped magnetic hysteresis loops in anomalous Hall voltage measurements and microscopically by in situ magnetic and electric field‐induced domain evolution captured via magnetic force microscopy. The first‐principles calculations reveal that the polarization of CuInP2S6 induces a significant modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii‐Moriya interaction (DMI) in Fe3GaTe2. Incorporating these effects into micromagnetic simulations reproduces key features of the experimental hysteresis behaviors, indicating that the polarization‐enhanced DMI lowers domain wall formation energy and drives a transition from coherent to incoherent magnetic reversal. These findings not only surmount the challenge of electrically modulating ferromagnetism in vdW systems via remanent ferroelectric polarization at room temperature but also open new pathways for energy‐efficient skyrmion manipulation and vdW spintronic device engineering.",

The electrochemical coupling resulting from the cathode‐anode kinetic differences severely restricts the accuracy of predicting the performance of HECs based on electrode performance. However, no general method can decouple the effects of cathode‐anode kinetics matching on electrochemical performance by integrating electrochemical coupling from an electrochemical perspective. Here, using an integrated method that combines two distinct three‐electrode testing modes in the typical sodium‐ion hybrid capacitors, the self‐matching effect of cathode‐anode working potential ranges is first refined as the foundation for kinetic matching and electrochemical coupling. The discrepancies and interdependencies in cathode‐anode electrochemical coupling for an individual kinetic match are decoupled by examining the impact of the self‐matching effect on the electrochemical results. The critical matching current density is introduced as a key kinetic parameter for evaluating the degree of cathode‐anode matching in complex electrochemical systems. This advancement provides an innovative design principle for electrode matching and coupling in high‐performance HECs.",

However, despite their unique advantages of direct‐current output and high current density, the output voltage of DDG is usually less than 1 V, which needs to be further improved to satisfy the demands of practical applications. Therefore, this study proposes a vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG that is conducive to an ultra‐high voltage output. The coupling enhancement effect arising from the synergy between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO3 surface and the built‐in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface has been identified as a key factor in achieving an impressively high open‐circuit voltage output of 41.3 V and a short‐circuit current of 1.53 µA. The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG can effectively power an LED without the requirement of an external energy storage and conversion circuit. Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding stability, showing no evident performance attenuation after continuous operation exceeding 3 h. The graphene/LiNbO3 DDG has enhanced the feasibility of real‐time energy supply for electronic components and paved the way for the efficient harvesting of mechanical energy from the environment.",

Overcoming this challenge necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the conduction mechanisms governing charge transport in these networks. In this study, a water‐based graphene ink is prepared via liquid‐phase exfoliation (LPE), deposited onto Si/SiO₂ substrates through inkjet printing, and electrically characterized over a wide temperature range (80–400 K) following thermal annealing at different temperatures. To interpret the temperature‐dependent conductivity, a Random Resistor Network (RRN) model is employed that accounts for spatial and energetic variability among nodes. With this approach low and high temperature transport regimes are effectively studied, identifying inter‐flake and intra‐flake hopping mechanisms and providing valuable insights into the factors governing charge transport. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the RRN model delivers statistically robust predictions while capturing temperature‐dependent transitions and annealing effects, achieving excellent agreement with experimental observations.",

By integrating and simplifying two traditional hybridization chain reaction (HCR) modules (HCR‐1 and HCR‐2) into a compact two‐probe system, signal interference is effectively minimized.

This sequential activation strategy significantly reduces signal leakage, enabling the high‐fidelity intracellular miRNA imaging and the precise differentiation of tumor cells from normal cells. Furthermore, by utilizing membrane proteins as inputs, the ISD circuit achieved the selective modulation of membrane protein distribution, facilitating the remote regulation of downstream cellular functions with high specificity.

    "abstract": "AbstractCopper‐based sulfide Cu2CdSnS4 solar cells exhibit excellent electronic band properties with the substitution of Cd with Zn in Cu2ZnSnS4 due to the reduction of sub‐band‐gap states. However, their performance remains inferior compared to other thin‐film solar cells, and the fundamental material characteristics that are responsible for this inferior performance are not elucidated. In this paper, the performance‐limiting factors of complicated chemical reactions involved in the sulfurization process are revealed by an in‐depth investigation of phase evolution and grain growth. It is shown that the Cu2‐xS in a Cl‐based precursor involved a multi‐step phase fusion reaction with the CdS and SnSx intermediate phases, leading to a severe VOC deficit. Conversely, it is observed that a rapid phase transition with the formation of Cu2SnS3 (CTS) at the initial stage for the Ac‐dominated sample generates numerous nucleation centers, resulting in poor crystallization. Hence, when a favorable ratio of Cl−/Ac− anion is employed, the substantial deficit in VOC of the CCTS solar cells primarily originated from [2CuCd++SnCd2−] defect cluster is alleviated, which is believed to result from the modified multi‐phase fusion and grain growth mechanism. The noteworthy champion efficiency of 11.89% with a VOC/VOC,SQ of 65.0% for the CCTS solar cells is achieved.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRenewable energy‐driven electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia presents a low‐carbon and promising route for sustainable ammonia synthesis. For Cu‐based electrocatalysts, due to their sluggish kinetics of the hydrogenation steps, nitrite often accumulates on the electrocatalysts surface, resulting in low ammonia yield rate and selectivity, as well as serious deactivation of electrocatalysts. Herein, a continuous relay site construction strategy that integrates the Cu─Co relay sites into an interconnected porous network is proposed. Owing to the adequately exposed interconnected Cu─Co relay sites, regulated adsorption energy of the nitrate and intermediates, promoted hydrogenation ability, and excellent self‐supportability of 3D skeleton, the Cu50Co50 aerogel realizes the high‐efficiency relay catalysis with an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 3.3 ± 0.27 mmol·h−1·cm−2 (2110 ± 173 mmol·h−1·gcat−1) and a large NH3 Faraday efficiency of ≈100% at −0.2 V vs. RHE. The potential need for the Cu50Co50 aerogel in the electrocatalysis at an industrial‐level current density remains stable even after 100‐h chronopotentiometry measurement, demonstrating excellent long‐term stability. Besides, the large‐scale preparation (>1 g) of the Cu50Co50 aerogel can be easily achieved, and its exceptional performance is maintained consistently. Such a continuous relay site construction strategy opens a new way for developing advanced electrocatalysts for high‐efficiency relay catalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMitigating non‐radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite heterointerface is critical for boosting the device performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Although carbazole phosphonic acid molecules (CPAMs) are widely utilized to modify the heterointerface for enhancing IPSCs performance, they face a fundamental trade‐off between hole extraction capability and surface wettability. Here, a synergistic molecular design of CPAM is reported to fine‐tune the NiOx/perovskite heterointerface. The synthesized [4‐(3,6‐methoxyphenyl‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (MeOPh‐4PACz) demonstrates a superior wettability compared to the commercial CPAMs, along with a higher dipole moment and exceptional hole extraction capability. These features collectively contribute to favorable band alignment between NiOx and perovskite and suppress interfacial charge recombination. Furthermore, MeOPh‐4PACz promotes perovskite crystal growth, enhancing the film quality and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer, which results in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 26.3% (25.8% certified) for the champion device. Under accelerated aging conditions, the device exhibits a T95 lifetime of 1052 h based on the ISOS‐D‐3 protocol.

Rather than providing a comprehensive survey of all structures and applications, this review focuses on recent advances in two major categories—liquid gels and porous materials—and explores their emerging roles in flexible electronics, thermal management, and water harvesting. The structure–property–function relationships and design principles underlying these materials are critically examined.

    "abstract": "AbstractEndocytosis is vital for nutrient uptake and nanomedicine applications, but the biophysics of the pre‐internalization phase remains poorly understood at single‐cell level. This study uses advanced robotic techniques to analyze pre‐internalization adhesion mechanics. MiaPaCa‐2 cells, pancreatic cancer, displayed three interaction phases: rapid lateral displacement, a quasi‐plateau phase, and linear displacement during extraction. Adhesion time is linked to changes in cell mechanics, with MiaPaCa‐2 cells displaying a biphasic uptake process—an initial rapid adhesion phase followed by a strengthening of adhesion high variability in viscoelasticity. In contrast, fibroblasts show a gradual increase in adhesion forces, accompanied by significant rises in stiffness and viscosity. Unlike traditional endocytosis studies, this study focuses on how pathway inhibitors alter initial membrane engagement rather than uptake mechanisms. Clathrin inhibition increased adhesion by 39%, caveolae inhibition by 27%, and microtubule inhibition reduced adhesion by 48%, indicating microtubules' role in adhesion dynamics. Combined inhibition of clathrin, caveolae, and microtubules reduced adhesion by 70%, showing that disrupting multiple pathways severely impairs particle adhesion. Under repeated stress, MiaPaCa‐2 cells soften (≈75% Young's modulus reduction) due to cytoskeletal disruption, while fibroblasts gradually soften (≈71% modulus reduction), highlighting cellular adaptations. These findings provide new insights into the pre‐internalization of particles at the single‐cell level.",

However, the safety concerns associated with Li‐metal batteries need to be addressed for their commercial viability. Most research has focused on the safety of separators and electrolytes, yet little emphasis is placed on the heat safety of lithium metal. In an out‐of‐control scenario, the combustion of lithium metal can release significantly more heat compared to other components. In this study, a highly safe composite Li metal anode is introduced fabricated by repeatedly rolling copper (Cu) powder and lithium metal. Electrochemical tests show that the Cu/Li anode can withstand up to 200 cycles, far surpassing the 50‐cycle lifespan of conventional Li metal anodes. Safety test results indicate that the Li/Cu composite anode possesses self‐extinguishing properties, significantly mitigating the safety risks associated with lithium metal batteries. Thermal runaway tests on the 1.0 Ah pouch cell demonstrate that the Li/Cu composite anode exhibits excellent safety characteristics, effectively inhibiting thermal runaway phenomena. The proposed straightforward, and high‐safety Li/Cu composite anode can enhance the safety profile of lithium metal batteries and provide crucial technical support for their industrial application.",

Among them, ZnTPP‐3O presents moderate dipole moment, the highest crystallinity, and the longest exciton lifetime, which contributes to the lowest Eb of 0.27 eV and prolonged LD, compared to ZnTPP‐1O and ZnTPP‐5O. Therefore, the photocatalyst based on ZnTPP‐3O nanoparticles (NPs) achieves a superior HER rate of 21.1 mmol g−1 h−1 under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight, which is the highest value for single‐component porphyrin‐based photocatalysts so far.

    "abstract": "AbstractAqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs) have great potential for large‐scale energy storage applications. However, the parasitic reactions, such as continuous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), seriously hamper the reversibility and cycling stability of the zinc metal anode (ZMA), limiting its practical application. In this paper, a pre‐growth interfacial layer strategy is adopted to grow the enol/ketone conversion interfacial layer on the surface of ZMA (denoted as Zn@AA). H+ can be reversible “lock/unlock” during reversible enol/ketone conversion reaction. It not only broadens the capacity of AZIBs (Zn2+/H+ co‐insertion), but also inhibits the HER reaction (the amounts of H2 evolution decreased obviously in both Zn@AA||Zn@AA and Zn@AA||VO2·H2O@Ppy (Ppy denote as polypyrrole) cells by on‐line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry analysis), thereby improving its stability performance. The cycle life of the assembled Zn@AA||Zn@AA cell exceeded 3200 h at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mA h cm−2. Furtherly, the Zn@AA||VO2·H2O@Ppy full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability and capacity retention. This work provides new ideas for modifying the ZMA interfacial layer to inhibit the HER, which guides the development of AZIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline materials characterized by high porosity, vast surface area, and structural variability. Despite the potential for sustainable energy applications, challenges remain in designing and engineering MOF powders with limited mechanical robustness and integrity into self‐standing, durable membranes while retaining their functionality. Inspired by unique structure of natural vascular bundles, an approach is developed to fabricating MOF membranes via dimensional reduction of superstructures. Interestingly, structural water‐flexibility of MOF superstructure led to homogeneous gelation, which can encapsulate a substantial amount of water molecules within porous structures, forming micro/nano‐scale channels for efficient proton transport. Hierarchical channel ensures super‐protonic conductivity values ranging from 0.07 S cm−1 (40% RH) at 293 K to 0.14 S cm−1 (90% RH) at 353 K. For the first time, it demonstrates relevant hydrogen fuel cell performance, achieving a peak power density of 48 mW cm−2. This study paves the way for engineering all‐MOF‐based materials as proton‐conducting membranes for low‐temperature hydrogen fuel cells.",

    "abstract": "The rational construction of single‐atom‐mediated Pt catalysts with optimized electronic structures and robust stability remains a grand challenge for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we pioneer a spatial confinement coupled with a d‐band engineering strategy to fabricate cobalt single‐atom coordinated Pt nanocatalysts (Pt@Co‐SAs/NC), achieving exceptional HER activity with ultralow Pt loading (0.94 wt%). The Pt@Co‐SAs/NC exhibits an overpotential of 15 mV at 10 mA/cm2 (ƞ10) and 21.8‐fold enhanced mass activity at 20 mV versus commercial Pt/C, surpassing most reported Pt‐based systems. Synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical studies reveal that the atomically dispersed CoN4 sites adjacent to Pt NPs serve as electronic modulators, inducing a 0.36 eV downshift of the Pt d‐band center through interfacial charge redistribution. This electronic engineering weakens hydrogen adsorption strength (ΔGH* =‐0.17 eV) while accelerating H2 desorption kinetics. Furthermore, the CoN4‐anchored carbon matrix suppresses nanoparticle aggregation and ensures exceptional durability through strong metal‐support interactions, maintaining 94.2% activity after 130 h operation. This work establishes an atomic‐level electronic modulation paradigm for designing highly efficient, cost‐effective, and durable electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "To further improve Lithium‐ion batteries (LiBs), a profound understanding of complex battery processes is crucial. Physical models offer understanding but are difficult to validate and parameterize. Therefore, automated machine‐learning methods (ML) are necessary to evaluate models with experimental data. Bayesian methods, e.g., Expectation Propagation + Bayesian Optimization for Likelihood‐Free Inference (EP‐BOLFI), stand out as they capture uncertainties in models and data while granting meaningful parameterization. An important topic is prolonging battery lifetime, which is limited by degradation, such as the solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. As a case study, we apply EP‐BOLFI to parametrize SEI growth models with synthetic and real degradation data. EP‐BOLFI allows for incorporating human expertise in the form of suitable feature selection, which improves the parametrization. We show that even under impeded conditions, we achieve correct parameterization with reasonable uncertainty quantification, needing less computational effort than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, the physically reliable summary statistics show if parameters are strongly correlated and not unambiguously identifiable. Further, we investigate Bayesian Alternately Subsampled Quadrature (BASQ), which calculates model probabilities, to confirm electron diffusion as the best theoretical model to describe SEI growth during battery storage.",

We sequenced four ancient\n            Borrelia recurrentis\n            genomes, the agent of louse-borne relapsing fever, dating from 2300 to 600 years ago.

Pan-genome analysis indicated that much of the evolution characteristic of\n            B. recurrentis\n            had occurred by ~2300 years ago, though further gene turnover, particularly in plasmid partitioning, persisted until ~1000 years ago.

A growing body of work has shown that IDRs often interact with partners in a manner that does not depend on the precise order of amino acids but is instead driven by complementary chemical interactions, leading to disordered bound-state complexes. However, these chemically specific dynamic interactions are difficult to predict. In this study, we repurposed the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to predict this chemical specificity between IDRs and partner proteins using protein sequence as the only input. Our approach—FINCHES—enables the direct prediction of phase diagrams, the identification of chemically specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, the decomposition of chemically distinct domains in IDRs, and a route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in molecular recognition.",

In this study, through a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identify carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) as an essential factor in a subset of MCL tumors. Our signal transduction studies reveal that CEACAM1 plays a critical role in BCR activation through involvement in two dynamic processes. First, following BCR engagement, CEACAM1 co-localizes to the membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) by anchoring to the F-actin cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein filamin A. Second, CEACAM1 recruits and increases the abundance of SYK in the BCR complex leading to BCR activation. These activities of CEACAM1 require its cytoplasmic tail and the N-terminal ectodomain. Considering that previous studies have extensively characterized CEACAM1 as an ITIM-bearing inhibitory receptor, our findings regarding its activating role are both surprising and context-dependent, which may have implications for BCR-targeting therapies.",

To understand how RNAPII functions in the human genome, we isolate transcribing RNAPII complexes from human nuclei by chromatin immunopurification, and determine the cryo-electron microscopy structures of RNAPII elongation complexes (ECs) associated with genomic DNA in distinct forms, without or with the elongation factors SPT4/5, ELOF1, and SPT6. This ChIP-cryoEM method also reveals the two EC-nucleosome complexes corresponding nucleosome disassembly/reassembly processes. In the structure of EC-downstream nucleosome, EC paused at superhelical location (SHL) −5 in the nucleosome, suggesting that SHL(−5) pausing occurs in a sequence-independent manner during nucleosome disassembly. In the structure of the EC-upstream nucleosome, EC directly contacts the nucleosome through the nucleosomal DNA-RPB4/7 stalk and the H2A-H2B dimer-RPB2 wall interactions, suggesting that EC may be paused during nucleosome reassembly. These representative EC structures transcribing the human genome provide mechanistic insights into understanding RNAPII transcription on chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Packaging in stretchable electronics is crucial to protect components from environmental damage while preserving mechanical flexibility and providing electrical insulation. The conventional packaging process involves multiple steps that increase in complexity as the number of circuit layers multiply. In this study, we introduce a self-packaged stretchable printed circuit board enabled by the in situ phase separation of liquid metal particles (LMPs) within various polymer matrices during solution-based printing processes. The ligand-bound LMPs (LB-LMPs), engineered to inhibit oxide growth, undergo in situ sintering, prompting vertical phase separation. This synthesis strategy not only achieves high initial conductivity of the LMPs but also encapsulates them within the polymer matrix, preventing leakage and providing electrical insulation. Our method enables multi-layer circuit printing, eliminating the need for additional activation and packaging processes. Furthermore, by integrating conductive materials into packaging layers for selective electrical conductivity, vertical interconnect accesses and conductive pads can be formed, enabling large-scale, stretchable, and leakage-free multi-layer electrical circuits and bio-interfaces.",

Atom motion on non-magnetic surfaces has been studied extensively both theoretically and by real-space techniques such as field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. For magnetic surfaces ab-initio calculations have predicted strong effects of the magnetic state onto adatom diffusion, but to date no corresponding experimental data exists. Here, we investigate different atoms on the hexagonal Mn monolayer on Re(0001) using scanning tunneling microscopy at T = 4.2 K and density functional theory. Experimentally, we observe one-dimensional motion of Co, Rh, and Ir atoms on the hexagonal Mn layer, dictated by the row-wise antiferromagnetic state. Co atoms move up to 10 nm when their motion is initiated by local voltage pulses. Our calculations reveal anisotropic potential landscapes, which favor one-dimensional motion for both Rh and Co atoms, avoiding induced Rh spin moments and conserving the Co spin direction during movement, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the magnetic properties of a system can be a means to control adatom mobility, even in the case of non-magnetic adatoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Axion-like particles (ALPs) arise from well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model and could account for dark matter. ALP dark matter would manifest as a field oscillating at an (as of yet) unknown frequency. The frequency depends linearly on the ALP mass and plausibly ranges from 10−22 to 10 eV/c\n            2. This motivates broadband search approaches. We report on a direct search for ALP dark matter with an interferometer composed of two atomic K-Rb-3He comagnetometers, one situated in Mainz, Germany, and the other in Kraków, Poland. We leverage the anticipated spatio-temporal coherence properties of the ALP field and probe all ALP-gradient-spin interactions covering a mass range of nine orders of magnitude. No significant evidence of an ALP signal is found. We thus place new upper limits on the ALP-neutron, ALP-proton and ALP-electron couplings reaching below g\n            \n              a\n              N\n              N\n             −9 GeV−1, g\n            \n              a\n              P\n              P\n             −7 GeV−1 and g\n            \n              a\n              e\n              e\n             −6 GeV−1, respectively.

Several stem rust resistance (Sr) genes exhibit temperature-dependent immune responses. Sr6-mediated resistance is enhanced at lower temperatures, whereas Sr13 and Sr21 resistances are enhanced at higher temperatures. Here, we clone Sr6 using mutagenesis and resistance gene enrichment and sequencing (MutRenSeq), identifying it to encode a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein with an integrated BED domain. Sr6 temperature sensitivity is also transferred to wheat plants transformed with the Sr6 gene. Differential gene expression analysis of near-isogenic lines inoculated with Pgt at varying temperatures reveals that genes upregulated in the low-temperature-effective Sr6 response differ from those upregulated in the high-temperature-effective responses associated with Sr13 and Sr21. These findings highlight divergent molecular pathways involved in temperature-sensitive immunity and inform future strategies for deployment and engineering of genetic resistance in response to a changing climate.",

However, logistics and costs of microcensus surveys and tree canopy or cloud cover obscuring settlements in satellite images limit its wider applications in tropical rural settings. Here, we present a two-step Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach that can integrate routinely collected health intervention campaign data and partially observed settlement data to produce reliable small area population estimates. Reductions in relative error rates were 32–73% in a simulation study, and ~32% when applied to malaria survey data in Papua New Guinea. The results highlight the value of demographic data routinely collected through health intervention campaigns or household surveys for improving small area population estimates, and how biases introduced by satellite data limitations can be overcome.",

In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations. Together, our data strongly indicate that the inactivation of the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, improving AD outcome.",

While recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven digital twin development using discrete-time data and finite-depth models on digital hardware, these approaches face significant limitations. They struggle to capture continuous-time dynamics and model complex systems, and suffer from substantial time and energy overheads due to physically separated storage and processing as well as frequent analog-digital (A/D) conversions. Here, we propose a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins. Our approach is intrinsically time-continuous using infinite-depth neural networks to model complex dynamics. Fully analog memristor arrays collocate storage and computation, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck and reducing A/D conversion requirements. We experimentally validate our solver on digital twins of HP variable-resistor model and Lorenz96 dynamics, demonstrating a 166.5-fold/369.3-fold speedup and a 499.0-fold/673.9-fold improvement in energy efficiency, respectively.

    "abstract": "Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, is widely used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and drug-resistant Gram-positive infections. However, prolonged use is associated with severe hematologic toxicity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of linezolid metabolites. Our clinical study indicates that elevated exposure to PNU142586, a primary metabolite of linezolid, is associated with an increased risk of linezolid-induced toxicity, even in the absence of renal impairment. To elucidate its mechanism, we identify DNA topoisomerase 2-α (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-β (TOP2B) as primary targets of PNU142586 at molecular, cellular, and in vivo levels. PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the regulation of N6-methyladenosine (m\n            6\n            A), the prominent internal modification in mRNA, fosters the development of potential therapeutic strategies for human cancers. While the m\n            6\n            A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout of\n            FTO\n            , but not\n            ALKBH5\n            , significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression.

Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppresses\n            ELK3\n            expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy. Our findings unravel the crucial role of FTO in T-ALL and highlight the FTO-ELK3 axis as a key nodule during leukemogenesis, thereby providing a fundamental basis to harness selective FTO antagonist for T-ALL therapeutics.",

However, a region that has not been investigated through ancient genomics so far is Colombia, the entry point into South America. Here, we report genome-wide data of 21 individuals from the Bogotá Altiplano in Colombia between 6000 and 500 years ago. We reveal that preceramic hunter-gatherers represent a previously unknown basal lineage that derives from the initial South American radiation. These hunter-gatherers do not carry differential affinity to ancient North American groups nor contribute genetically to ancient or present-day South American populations. By 2000 years ago, the local genetic ancestry is replaced by populations from Central America associated with the Herrera ceramic complex and survives through the Muisca period despite major cultural changes. These ancient Altiplano individuals show higher affinities to Chibchan speakers from the Isthmus of Panama than to Indigenous Colombians, suggesting a dilution of the Chibchan-related ancestry through subsequent dispersal events.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which epithelial stem cells (SCs) sense mechanical cues within their niche and convert the information into biochemical signals to govern their function are not well understood. Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion of\n            Piezo1\n            leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs. These findings establish the force threshold necessary for PIEZO1 activation and reveal PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx as a key mechanism for sensing mechanical cues in the niche and regulating HF-SC activity.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity stimulates mRNA translation crucial for learning and development, but the mechanism linking translation to neuronal activity is not understood. In humans, learning and memory are severely disrupted by mutations in the potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, Slo2.2). We find that pharmacological stimulation of this channel and a constitutively active Slack mutation stimulate mRNA translation of a reporter for β-actin mRNA in cell lines and increases the synthesis of β-actin in the neurites of cortical neurons. Moreover, channel activation promotes the binding of two key mRNA translation regulators, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1–interacting protein 1), to the channel itself, releasing both from eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), where they normally inhibit initiation of translation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for Slack activity–dependent regulation of translation and suggests that the effects of Slack mutations on this process may explain the severe intellectual disabilities associated with these mutations.",

Sputtering is an atmospheric escape process that may have been dominant during earlier epochs of our Sun according to isotopic evidence, but is difficult to detect under current solar conditions. Using over 9 years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, we present the first observations of present-day sputtering in the martian upper atmosphere. By correlating argon densities with solar electric fields, we find that sputtered rates of argon are over four times higher than model predictions. We also present evidence of enhanced sputtering during a solar storm, offering a glimpse at more intense conditions in the early solar system.

The PSCs blade-coated under ambient conditions using Poly-2PACz HTL achieved a remarkable efficiency of 26.0% and outstanding UV stability.

Using benzoylecgonine (a nonvolatile cocaine metabolite) as a sewage tracer, we find that wastewater compounds—including a mixture of illicit drugs, drug metabolites, and chemicals from tires and personal care products—become aerosolized and are detectable in both water and air. Spatial analyses confirm that most measured chemicals concentrate in aerosols near the Tijuana River, potentially exposing local populations to tens of nanograms per hour (e.g., octinoxate and methamphetamine) via inhalation. This airborne pathway highlights a largely overlooked source of atmospheric pollution, emphasizing the need to reassess health risks in coastal regions as global water contamination continues to escalate.",

Here, we theoretically introduce a previously unidentified class of non-Hermitian soliton combs that are enabled by engineering the dissipation and dispersion of a coupled resonator array with nonreciprocal couplings. We show that these non-Hermitian soliton combs allow unprecedented postfabrication agile reconfigurability of the soliton comb spectrum, where the number of comb lines, as well as their frequency spacing, can be markedly tuned by simply tuning the hopping phases between resonators. Such reconfigurable non-Hermitian combs generated using coupled resonator arrays could enable new functionalities for a multitude of comb applications.",

Using a mouse gambling task with a reinforcement-learning model, we described individual decision-making profiles as a combination of three archetypal strategies: Optimizers, Risk-averse, and Explorers. These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles. Hence, we propose that striatal populations from different subregions influence distinct decision-making parameters, leading to profile-dependent choices.",

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism.",

After the Roman conquest, Anatolia experienced a rapid transition to profoundly anthropogenic landscapes, reaching hitherto unknown levels of agricultural production that remained stable for several centuries. At the socioeconomic level, as revealed by our application of social network analysis to the numismatic data, the growth dynamics continued, leading to ever greater integration. When international conflict in the seventh c. CE disrupted the connectivity, the anthropogenic landscapes rewilded.

    "abstract": "Enhancement and active control of light-matter interactions at the atomic scale is important for developing next-generation nanophotonic and quantum optical devices. Here, we demonstrate electric control of excitonic strong coupling and electroluminescence (EL) by integrating a semiconductor monolayer into a nanometer gap of single electrically driven nanocube-on-mirror plasmonic nanocavities, which provide unmatched optical and electrical confinement. In particular, in a strongly coupled system of nanocavity plasmons and tungsten diselenide (WSe\n            2\n            ) excitons, an ultrastrong electric field generated in the nanocavity gap enables reversible modulation of the Rabi splitting between ~108 and 102 milli–electron volts with a bias of only 2.5 volts. In the quantum tunneling regime (realized by decreasing the gap size), by injection of carriers into a nanocavity-integrated tungsten disulfide (WS\n            2\n            ) monolayer, spectrally tunable EL (controlled by the bias polarity) is achieved with a room-temperature quantum efficiency reaching ~3.5%, showing an improvement of more than 10\n            3\n            times over previous works.",

A549 cancerous alveolar and BEAS-2B normal bronchial epithelial cells were exposed at the air-liquid interface to the total aerosol or gas phase of either fresh or photochemically aged tailpipe emissions from a gasoline EURO 6d car equipped with a gasoline particulate filter. Diluted fresh emissions contained particle number concentrations comparable to low ambient air levels and induced no detectable cytotoxicity. Photochemical aging led to the formation of secondary aerosols and caused significant cytotoxicity. While the aged aerosol induced significant DNA damage, oxidative stress was more associated with volatile secondary species.

To study a variety of Hamiltonians and investigate their properties, it is essential to have highly configurable and easily engineerable structures with low disorder. Here, we demonstrate in situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger topological lattice by using an open-cavity configuration with an organic polymer layer. Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue shift, and extended macroscopic coherence. Furthermore, we engineer the bandgap and the edge state localization by adjusting the interaction between adjacent lattice sites. Our results demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the platform for the investigation of quantum fluids in complex potential landscapes and topological effects at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons influence diverse behaviors with varied firing patterns, yet the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We introduce a multiplexed genetically encoded sensor–based imaging and voltammetry method to simultaneously record synaptic, perisynaptic, and extrasynaptic dopaminergic transmission at mouse central neurons. Using this method alongside a genetically encoded sensor–based image analysis program, we found that heterogeneous dopaminergic firing patterns create various transmission modes, encoding frequency, number, and synchrony of firing pulses using neurotransmitter quantity, releasing synapse count, and synaptic and/or volume transmission. Under both tonic and low-frequency phasic activities, transporters effectively reuptake dopamine at perisynaptic sites, confining dopamine within synaptic clefts to mediate synaptic transmission. In contrast, under high-frequency, particularly synchronized firing activity or transporter inhibition, released dopamine may overwhelm transporters, escaping from synaptic clefts via one to three outlet channels, triggering volume transmission. Our study illuminates a collaborative mechanism of synaptic enclosures, properties, and transporters that defines the coding principles of activity pattern–dependent dopaminergic transmission modes.",

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of a CoL1‐MOF was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M KOH, with a three‐electrode setup under an N2 atmosphere. The CoL1‐MOF exhibited a 436 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the bare GCE showed negligible activity. Tafel slope of 75 mV/dec revealed CoL1‐MOF follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. The intrinsic activity of CoL1‐MOF was further assessed through electrochemical parameters, including electrochemical double‐layer capacitance (Cdl), roughness factor (Rf), and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), demonstrating enhanced accessibility to active sites. Stability tests showed that CoL1‐MOF maintained consistent HER activity during continuous operation, with a gradual increase in current density due to structural reconstruction. Post‐electrolysis PXRD analysis confirmed the formation of metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide phases accompanied by morphological changes. Remarkably, the post‐electrolysis CoL1‐MOF demonstrated enhanced HER performance with a reduction in overpotential. This study demonstrates the cost‐effective synthesis of 1D transition metal‐based MOFs and their potential for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a promising solution to the energy crisis.",

In this, molecular oxygen has been used as an ideal and green oxidant, which activates the inert CN bond. Various derivatives of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate salts are prepared, which include different electron‐withdrawing and electron‐donating group substituents. This protocol utilizes Pd/C as a heterogeneous catalyst, which is smoothly recyclable. Moreover, this developed method is ligand and cocatalyst free, and it does not require any base to activate the amines as nucleophile, and the new process effectively provides a mild pathway toward a variety of tertiary amide moieties with significant yield. This way, the potent protocol is economical, simple, recyclable, and operates at milder conditions and contributes toward valuable products that are vital in an industrial domain.",

    "abstract": "A combination of physical methods was employed to characterize Pd‐S and Pd‐P catalysts (Pd–nS/NaZSM‐5, Pd–nP/NaZSM‐5, Pd–nP/HZSM‐5) prepared with varying [modifier]: [Pd] ratios using elemental sulfur or phosphorus as modifiers. These catalysts form solid solutions of sulfur or phosphorus in palladium and exhibit similar dispersity. A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the modifying effects of sulfur and phosphorus on the properties of palladium catalysts in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions. The results demonstrate that sulfur incorporation significantly reduces hydrogen conversion while enhancing Н2О2 selectivity. In contrast, Pd‐P catalysts achieve a more balanced activity–selectivity profile and exhibit productivity levels an order of magnitude higher than those of the Pd–0.25S/NaZSM‐5 catalyst. These findings provide critical insights for selecting p‐elements as modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in hydrogen peroxide synthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe increase in CO2 emissions contributes massively to the aggravation of climate change. The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is a possible approach for reducing this gas emissions by converting emitted CO2 into a value‐added product. Therefore, the development of efficient catalysts for this reaction is fundamental. In this study, CuZn bimetallic catalysts supported on composites of AC‐Al2O3 and CNT‐Al2O3 were synthesized, and their catalytic performance was assessed. The catalytic experiments were conducted at 250 °C and 30 bar for 15 h, under a H2:CO2 ratio of 3. The catalysts CuZn/AC‐Al2O3 (50:50) and CuZn/AC‐Al2O3 (70:30) demonstrated an overall improved catalytic performance when compared to the catalyst supported on pristine AC, indicating that the increased presence of mesopores and the synergistic effect between AC and Al2O3 are beneficial. The catalyst CuZn/CNT‐Al2O3 (90:10) performed similarly to the catalyst supported on pristine CNT. CuZn/CNT‐Al2O3 (50:50) and CuZn/CNT‐Al2O3 (70:30) displayed reduced CO2 conversion but enhanced methanol selectivity compared to the reference catalyst, CuZn/Al2O3, suggesting that the presence of CNT is advantageous for methanol selectivity. The catalyst CuZn/CNT presented the highest methanol yield, and was stable for over 80 h on a TOS experiment.",

The process demonstrates high selectivity for the hydroxyl groups of benzyl and allyl alcohols, while minimizing the reactivity of other functional groups, thereby enhancing atom efficiency. The scalability and industrial applicability of the method are evidenced by its successful use in the modification of natural products and the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates, as well as through scale‐up experiments, continuous‐flow processes, and the successful implementation of tandem reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway, mediated by singlet oxygen and superoxide anions.",

Hydrogen photoproduction was evaluated under dynamic conditions using gas‐phase ethanol–water mixtures and UV light. The optimal catalyst, prepared with K2PtCl6 at 0.33 wt.% Pt, exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate (7.4 mmol H2 h−1 gcat−1). Synthesis optimization via a Taguchi design of experiments identified low milling time, energy, and ball‐to‐powder ratio as key factors. Compared to a conventional Pt/TiO2 catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, the best ball‐milled sample showed 1.3 times higher hydrogen production and 1.2 times faster stabilization. Advanced characterization (HAADF‐STEM) revealed isolated Pt atoms in the ball‐milled catalyst, in contrast to small clusters in the reference. Post‐reaction analysis showed nanoparticle growth in both samples, but only the conventional sample developed fully formed nanoparticles (2.0 ± 0.8 nm). XPS detected a significant increase in surface K in the conventional catalyst due to a resurfacing effect. The superior performance of the ball‐milled sample is attributed to the stabilization of Pt single atoms and suppression of surface K restructuring, enhancing charge separation via modulation of the Schottky barrier.",

However, achieving high selectivity for C2+ products remains a significant challenge. In this study, we have engineered a copper‐based biphasic catalyst comprising both copper carbonate basic and copper oxide (CCB/CuO), which demonstrates superior selectivity for C2+ products. The restructured catalyst retains a loose, porous microsphere secondary structure, providing ample active space for reactants and intermediates. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveals that CuO facilitates the activation of H2O to supply the requisite protons, while CCB enhances the adsorption of the intermediate *CO, synergistically contributing to the formation of C2+ products. As a result, the optimized CCB/CuO catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 52.7% for C2H4 and 79.1% for C2+ products, with FEC2H4 remaining above 40% for a duration of 10 h.",

It helps to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER by significantly altering the reaction pathway followed by conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). A comprehensive understanding of the lattice oxygen‐mediated (LOM) OER mechanism is essential for designing a stable electrocatalyst with enhanced lattice oxygen involvement, leading to improved OER activity. This concept article presents a detailed understanding of the LOM OER mechanism in contrast to AEM and their manifestation in the OER activity. The recent progress in the general approaches adopted to enhance lattice oxygen participation in perovskite oxide electrocatalysts is also discussed. This article will provide guidelines for designing new perovskite‐based OER electrocatalysts with enhanced lattice oxygen participation or to improve the lattice oxygen participation in existing perovskite oxide electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy has shaped our understanding of light-matter interaction at the atomic level. However, the photoinduced formation of chemical bonds, especially for larger aggregates, has evaded observation due to difficulties to prepare reactants at well-defined initial conditions. Here, we overcome this hurdle by taking advantage of the exceptional solvation properties of superfluid helium, which allow us to stabilize atoms in a metastable, foam-like configuration with 10 Å interatomic distance. We apply photoexcitation with a femtosecond laser pulse to collapse such a dilute metastable aggregate of Mg atoms formed inside a nanometer-sized He droplet, and track cluster formation at a characteristic time of (450 ± 180) fs through photoionization with a time-delayed second pulse. We find that energy pooling collisions of electronically excited Mg atoms occur during cluster formation, leading to transient population of highly-excited Mg atoms, up to 3 eV above the excitation photon energy. Relaxation and conversion to nuclear kinetic energy drives cluster fragmentation and ejection of ionic fragments from the droplet. Our results demonstrate the potential of He droplets for bond formation studies, and for revealing involved energy- and charge transfer dynamics, like photon energy upconversion.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical investigation involving electron collisions with cyanoacetylene is reported. Differential cross sections (DCSs), integral cross sections (ICSs), and momentum-transfer cross sections (MTCSs) for the elastic electron scattering were calculated using the Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method at the static-exchange plus polarization (SEP) level of approximation for energies ranging from 0.5 to 30 eV. The Schwinger variational method combined with Padé's approximants (SVPA), considering static-exchange-polarization plus absorption (SEPA), was also applied for impact energies from 0.1 to 1000 eV. These results were complemented by calculations performed according to the screen-corrected independent atom model (SCIAM). Furthermore, original measurements of absolute elastic (DCSs) at 20 eV were conducted in a crossed-beam apparatus. The theoretical results display an outstanding agreement with each other and an overall agreement with the calculated cross sections available in the literature. The agreement between the calculated and measured results is quite encouraging, further validating the thoroughness of the current research.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis work describes the rational design and synthesis of hepsin‐recognized amphiphilic‐branched peptides (DMN‐SIPL) that can form solid condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon enzymatic reaction. The peptide forms solid‐like condensates both in vitro and in living cells, triggered by type‐II membrane‐associated serine peptidase, hepsin, whose overexpression determines prostate cancer progression. Specifically, integrating self‐assembly, hepsin hydrolysis, and hepsin‐binding domain generates a branched substrate that acts as a precursor for enzyme‐induced LLPS. Upon binding hepsin on the cell membrane, DMN‐SIPL forms condensates initiated by hepsin‐induced self‐assembly. The prostate cancer cells then uptake these condensates via lipid raft‐mediated endocytosis. The entrapped hepsin in the condensates further hydrolyzes the DMN‐SIPL to stabilize the intracellular condensates. Structure–activity relationship reveals the importance of enzyme‐binding motif, enzyme‐recognized motif, and the self‐assembly motif. Mechanistic studies indicate that the resulting solid‐like condensates modulate cancer cell metabolism by inhibiting hepsin upstream protein activation and downstream signal transduction, ultimately inducing cancer cell growth inhibition selectively. As a first example, this work investigates enzymatic LLPS condensate formation in living cells, paving the way to generate functional synthetic biomolecular condensates through LLPS for biomedical applications.",

This study proposes an ion polarization‐driven defect engineering strategy, which regulates the electronic structure and Na+ transmission dynamics of NFPP through Bi3+ doping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that Bi3+ with (18+2) electron configuration significantly enhances the crystal structure stability of NFPP by strengthening the covalency of Bi‐O bonds. Meanwhile, the heterovalent Bi3+ doping optimizes the bandgap of the material (from 3.29 eV to 0.16 eV) and promotes Na+ diffusion, while introducing lattice defects to provide additional sodium storage sites. The optimized 0.02Bi‐NFPP cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as the half‐cell only takes 31.6 minutes to charge to 80% at a rate of 1 C, and the capacity decay is only 0.000495 mA h g‐1 per cycle (86.9% capacity retention) over 20,000 cycles at 20 C. The full battery based on hard carbon anode maintains 95.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. This study reveals the synergistic mechanism between ion polarization effect and lattice defects, and provides a new strategy for designing SIBs cathode materials with both fast charging/discharging capabilities and ultra‐long life.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOrganic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential use in flexible, lightweight, and cost‐effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure—termed dynamic disorder—that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low‐frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad range of phonons  drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance. In this review, we explore progress toward uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode‐resolved analyses of electron–phonon interactions lends toward the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design. This work offers an overview of the insight gained toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing charge transport in OSCs and outlines pathways for enhancing performance via targeted manipulation of interatomic/intermolecular interactions and resulting phonon modes.",

However, Type I‐B main‐chain PRs, featuring multiple wheels and stoppers along the polymer backbone, remain underexplored due to the challenges in their design and synthesis. Herein, we introduce a facile “host−guest recognition followed by click polymerization” strategy for the synthesis of Type I‐B main‐chain PR, which is subsequently employed to prepare the first‐ever Type I‐B main‐chain PR network (PRN). Compared to the control whose wheels are nonslidable under applied force, the distinctive dynamic behaviors of Type I‐B main‐chain PR impart extraordinary mechanical enhancements to PRN, with fracture strain, toughness, and puncture resistance all surging by more than 27‐fold. Moreover, the combination of the host−guest recognition and multiple stoppers endows the PRN with great self‐recovery capability due to the restriction of the motion range of mechanical bonds. This work not only presents a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing Type I‐B main‐chain PR networks but also highlights the pivotal role of Type I‐B main‐chain PRs in enhancing material performance, offering valuable insights for advancing the development of dynamic polymer materials.",

The aziridine‐containing products are amenable to a variety of further reactions to generate useful groupings of functionality. Furthermore, we show that the carbamate group is effective for directing highly enantioselective benzylic C─H amination when it is appended to phenethyl alcohols. Intermolecular C─H amination of phenethyl alcohol derivatives has proven highly challenging to achieve asymmetrically yet it gives rise to valuable β‐amino alcohols. Both processes result in rapid access to versatile, highly enantioenriched small molecule building blocks for synthesis and highlight the effectiveness and generality of this chiral cation‐based strategy for asymmetric catalysis. We report studies that probe important structural features of the chiral cation and demonstrate that the ion‐paired complexes can be formed from their individual components without a separate isolation step.",

We have developed a bone‐inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn‐HA‐Gel) composed of Zn‐doped hydroxyapatite (Zn‐HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. The bone‐like structure and strong molecular interactions in the biodegradable, recyclable, and biocompatible components endow Zn‐HA‐Gel with excellent sustainability, water retention, and mechanical properties, which solves the problems currently associated with Zn anodes. Moreover, the Zn‐HA superionic conductor exhibits an ultrahigh intrinsic ionic conductivity and accelerated Zn2+ desolvation process. The dual‐channels for Zn2+ transport in Zn‐HA‐Gel result in high ionic conductivity (32.5 mS cm‐1) and transference number (0.80), facilitating uniform Zn plating/stripping and durable working stability. As a result, Zn‐HA‐Gel ensures ultra‐stable cycling performance with a cumulative capacity of 5 Ah cm‐2 at 5 mA cm‐2/5 mAh cm‐2 for Zn/Zn cells, and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 82.4% after 2000 cycles for full cells, surpassing the capabilities of current hydrogel electrolytes, and has potential applications in sustainable and functional energy‐storage devices.",

    "abstract": "FAPbI3‐based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are highly promising due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the formation of stable α‐FAPbI3 requires annealing at temperature of at least 150 °C, which can induce significant residual stress and make the process incompatible with plastic substrates, resulting in poor crystal quality and compromised mechanical properties. To address these issues, we present a novel approach using methylammonium chloride (MACl) vapor‐assistance of lead iodide (PbI2) to form homogeneous intermediate phases (MAPbCl3 and Pb3I8). This method optimizes the reaction pathway, accordingly pure α‐phase perovskite can be completely formed at 100 °C, contrasting with conventional MACl component engineering in organic amine salt solution. We have intensively deciphered the reaction pathway leading to intermediate phases formation, as well as the nucleation and phase transition processes into the photoactive perovskite at 100 °C. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive study on temperature‐dependent residual stress and cations reaction competition, meanwhile extensively dissected the competitive implication of interface mismatch and lattice defects leading to residual stress and cations component inhomogeneity. Consequently, the modified flexible‐PVSCs have achieved a remarkable efficiency of 24.46% (25.50% for rigid PVSCs). The devices also exhibit significantly improved long‐term and mechanical stability.",

    "abstract": "Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 is a promising solution to remove residual CO in feed stream to avoid Pt poisoning in proton‐exchange‐membrane fuel cells, in which the development of high‐efficiency catalysts with a wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Fe(OH)x modified Pt clusters (~1.6 nm) catalyst supported on MgAlOx derived from PtFeMgAl‐layered double hydroxides precursor, which is featured with abundant Ptδ+–(OH)x–Fe3+ interfacial sites. Impressively, the optimal catalyst Pt‐Fe(OH)x/MA exhibits exceptional catalytic performance towards CO‐PROX, which can completely remove CO in a H2‐rich stream with an ultra‐wide full CO conversion window (25−225 °C) at a rather high space velocity (130000 mL gcat−1 h−1). The mass‐speciﬁc activity reaches to 9.09 molCO gPt−1 h−1 at 25 °C, which is preponderant to the state‐of‐the‐art catalysts. In addition, a 240‐h stream‐on‐line test over Pt‐Fe(OH)x/MA shows a satisfactory stability. A comprehensive investigation based on in situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveals that the –OH group at the Ptδ+–(OH)x–Fe3+ interfacial site is easily bound to the linearly‐adsorbed CO at the adjacent Ptδ+ site to form carboxylate intermediate, followed by its decomposition to CO2. Meanwhile, the generated coordination unsaturated Fe2+ site facilitates the activation cracking of O2 molecule without energy barrier.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCopper nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit significant potential in electrocatalysis owing to their tunable electronic structure and abundant surface‐active sites. However, the multifaceted complexity of Cu‐based nanoparticles induced by heteroatom dopants fundamentally limits our ability to decipher the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) mechanism, creating a critical knowledge gap that obstructs the targeted engineering of advanced catalysts with atomic precision. In this study, we employed first‐principles calculations to design a series of highly surface‐dispersed transition metal‐doped Cu138X2 (X = Ag, Au, Pd, Zn, Ni, Pt) bimetallic electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3), based on the structure of Cu140 NPs. Theoretical analysis revealed that Cu138Au2 exhibits significant advantages in NO3RR, with a remarkably low limiting potential of −0.20 eV. In addition, significant energy barriers were observed for the formation of by‐products NO and NO2 on Cu138Au2, ensuring high selectivity towards ammonia. For Cu‐based catalysts, we propose that the *NO2 → *HNO2 step is critical and can serve as a descriptor for rapid screening of these catalysts. This study not only provides important insights into the research of Cu NPs as NO3RR electrocatalysts but also establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing their catalytic performance through surface modification or compositional tuning.",

The complex acyclic lateral chains containing a stereochemical triad with the quaternary center surrounded by two hindered secondary alcohols were synthesized in a straightforward way by the use of two consecutive and highly diastereoselective aldol reactions with a lactone intermediate and further transformations to yield the desired (Z)‐vinyl iodide. Successful esterification with a functionalized diene‐stannane yielded the fully elaborated carbon skeleton. Making use of the C2 symmetry of the natural product, a double Stille coupling gave the protected natural product. Final deprotection provided (+)‐disorazole Z1, which was fully identical to a natural sample.",

Similarly, N,N‐bis(4‐(N′‐dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris‐hexafluorophosphate (12‐PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low ΔSf of 18 J·K−1·mol−1 at 206 °C. The temperature‐dependent soft crystalline phases of 11‐PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11‐PF6 was measured to be 2.04 × 10−6 S·cm−1 at 70 °C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16 × 10−4 S·cm−1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11‐PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (versus Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high‐voltage electrolyte component.",

However, the extremely low solubility of MNc has limited its practical application as a theranostic agent. In this research, we synthesized NiNc precursors (ox‐NiNc) having two alkoxy groups on the α‐carbons of the diagonal pyrroles with significantly improved solubility. We also prepared an amphiphilic derivative, ox‐NiNc‐PEG, and investigated its conversion to NiNc through reductive aromatization. We demonstrated that ox‐NiNc‐PEG was efficiently converted to NiNc in cancer cells with elevated glutathione levels, resulting in enhanced photoacoustic signals and increased phototoxicity based on photothermal conversion under NIR light irradiation. The target‐oriented reductive aromatization in response to the reducing environment in cancer cells offers a critical strategy for developing PAI/PTT theranostic agents.",

The synergistic optimization of the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps presents a challenge for the HER. Here, we have synthesized phosphorus‐doped tungsten trioxide with oxygen vacancies(OV) (P‐WO3‐x) using a simple but effective hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination annealing. Interestingly, the P‐WO3‐x material exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from conventional tungsten oxide‐based electrocatalysts. The introduction of OV and phosphorus doping creates an optimal structure that significantly improves the electronic properties and the catalytic sites. The OV enhance the material's ability to adsorb and activate water molecules, while phosphorus doping further modifies the electronic structure, facilitating more efficient hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the catalyst demonstrates a favorable urchin‐like morphology with excellent supportability. Remarkably, the P‐WO3‐x electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent HER performance and excellent durability. We indicate that P‐WO3‐x exhibits a small overpotential (122.68 mV at −10 mA cm−2), a low Tafel slope (74.97 mV dec−1), and excellent durability over 12 hours. This work presents a significant advance for the development of tungsten oxide‐based electrocatalysts with anion doping and OV for HER in acidic media.",

The structure of the MOF, solved ab‐initio from laboratory powder X‐ray diffraction data, displays analogies with that of the commercially available Al‐fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH‐bridged AlO6 octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of ultra‐micropores with a size lower than 4 Å. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al‐TFS a slightly higher CO2 selectivity compared to N2 and CH4 than the Al‐fumarate analog, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO2 adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X‐ray diffraction, solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.",

While various ligands, such as β‐diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence, and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air‐stable Shibasaki‐type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3′‐fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (τobs), sensitization efficiency (ηsens), and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 µs, 38%, and 0.7% to 2.7 µs, 63%, and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963 nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad, potentially encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.",

Herein, we report an energy transfer (EnT) promoted photocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides via sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]propellane. This approach utilizes N‐nitrososulfonamides as precursors, facilitating the generation of sulfonamide radicals through homolytic cleavage under EnT promotion. These radicals were then found to engage in an addition reaction with [1.1.1]propellane, generating bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) radicals that undergo subsequent C─H, C─X, C─S, or C─C coupling reactions to afford a variety of C3‐substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides. This strategy featured mild conditions, operational simplicity, with high atomic utilization, and therefore not only offers an efficient synthesis of a range of C3‐versatile‐substituted BCP sulfonamides, but also significantly broadens the potential applicability of BCP‐sulfonamides in drug discovery.",

This study explores the impact of substituents on fluorescence and photoswitching efficiency in hemiindigos and hemithioindigos. A series of functionalized derivatives were synthesized by one‐step Knoevenagel condensations using a sustainable mechanochemical approach and characterized across various environments. Ortho‐OH‐substituted hemiindigo derivatives exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields (ΦFL = 0.65) while retaining significant photoswitching capabilities (ΦZ→E = 0.29 in THF) and fast recovery. These enhanced properties are attributed to the p‐electron‐donating characteristics of the OH substituents and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The results of CC2 ab initio calculations revealed a detailed photoswitching mechanism: (1) initial population of the fluorescent pp* singlet excited state minimum, (2) subsequent elongation of the C=O bond leading to depopulation of the pp* state to the np* excited state minimum, (3) twisting of the double bond within the np* state, and (4) relaxation to the ground electronic state via a conical intersection. The analysis of the potential‐energy surfaces modulated by EDG substittents, both in the in the pp* and np* excited states, provides insights into the structure‐property relationships of IFPSs, guiding future rational design.",

To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase‐responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor‐selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD‐NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor‐associated integrin αvβ3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans‐cyclooctene caged payloads through \"click‐to‐release\" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor‐selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe edge states (ES) in two‐dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit distinct electronic characteristics, including lower energy and longer lifetimes compared to the interior states (IS). Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A2PbBr4 (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out‐of‐plane distortion of adjacent PbBr6 octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin‐splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHighly responsive, voltage‐tunable dielectrics are essential for microwave‐telecommunication electronics. Ferroelectric/relaxor materials have been leading candidates for such functionality and have exhibited agile dielectric responses. Here, it is demonstrated that relaxor materials developed from antiferroelectrics can achieve both ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability. The system, based on alloying the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 with the dielectric BaZrO3, exhibits a more complex phase evolution than that in traditional relaxors and is characterized by an unconventional multi‐phase competition between antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric order. This interplay of phases can greatly enhance the local heterogeneities and results in relaxor characteristics while preserving considerable polarizability. Upon studying Pb1‐xBaxZrO3 for x = 0‐0.45, Pb0.65Ba0.35ZrO3 is found to provide for exceptional dielectric tunability under low bias fields (≈81% at 200 kV cm−1 and ≈91% at 500 kV cm−1) at 10 kHz, outcompeting most traditional relaxor ferroelectric films. This high tunability is sustained in the radio‐frequency range, resulting in a high commutation quality factor (>2000 at 1 GHz). This work highlights the phase evolution from antiferroelectrics (with lower, “positive” dielectric tunability) to relaxors (with higher, “negative” tunability), underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe single‐atom thickness of graphene holds great potential for device scaling, but its effectiveness as a thin metal‐ion diffusion barrier in microelectronics and a corrosion barrier for plasmonic devices is compromised by weak van der Waals interactions with copper (Cu), leading to delamination issues. In contrast, monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC), a recently reported single‐atom‐thick carbon film with a disordered sp2 hybridized structure, demonstrates superior adhesion properties. This study reveals that MAC exhibits an adhesion energy of 85 J m−2 on Cu, which is 13 times greater than that of graphene. This exceptional adhesion is attributed to the formation of covalent‐like Cu─C bonds while preserving its sp2 structure, as evidenced by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near‐edge X‐ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the corrugated structure of MAC facilitates the hybridization of C 2pz orbitals with Cu 4s and 3dz2 orbitals, promoting strong bonding. These insights indicate that the amorphous structure of MAC significantly enhances adhesion while preserving its elemental composition, providing a pathway to improve the mechanical reliability and performance of two‐dimensional (2D) materials on metal substrates in various technological applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolution‐processed micro‐patterning is a crucial process for making high‐performance optoelectronic devices, since the carrier transfer behavior is closely related to the uniformity, orientation, and resolution of micro‐patterns. Developing solution processes with good controllability has thus attracted increasing research interest in the last decade. Inspired by Chinese brushes, a fibrous‐guided direct‐writing strategy is recently developed that enables controllable liquid transfer for making micro‐patterns, which is systematically reviewed from viewpoints of both the fundamentals in liquid manipulation and the applications in optoelectronics. First, a model structure of dual‐conical fibers (CFs) is proposed, whose capacity in liquid transfer is featured as the dynamic liquid balance and the uniform liquid film. On the basis, triple‐ and multi‐ CFs are developed for transferring liquid onto the target substrate in a controllable manner, where the tri‐phase contact line can be finely tuned. Thereafter, micro‐patterns with µm‐scale resolution, cm‐scale uniformity, and molecular‐scale orientation can be achieved, as is demonstrated by the as‐prepared ultrasmooth quantum dot films, highly aligned silver nanowires films, and wrinkle‐free reduced graphene oxide films, respectively. The high‐performance optoelectronic devices, including quantum dot light‐emitting diodes, flexible transparent electrodes, and pressure sensors, are demonstrated. Perspectives for solution‐processed micro‐patterning in optoelectronics are also suggested.",

Here, a magnesiothermic crystallization approach is presented to construct origami capsule (OC) architectures, imparting flexibility and conformability to inherently brittle silicon, featuring highly interconnected 2D silicon nanosheets (2.5 nm thickness) with built‐in nanopores encapsulated within a pressure‐tolerant conformal microshell. The design leverages geometric features at both the nanoscale (within nanosheets) and microscale (capsule assembly) to impart structural elasticity and connectivity for efficient stress dissipation, enhancing mechanical integrity and rapid transport kinetics. Consequently, the OC anode exhibits low electrode swelling (14.7%) at 2945 mAh g−1 and exceptional rate capability, delivering a high capacity and ≈100% retention after 470 cycles at a large current density of 6 A g−1. This work bridges geometric design and materials science, opening new avenues for high‐performance energy storage solutions.",

Dual‐atomic catalysts offer valuable solutions due to their exceptional performance. This work explores the application of axial Cl‐coordinated Pt─Co dual atoms on N‐doped graphitic carbon (Pt1Co1/NC─Cl) catalysts utilizing PtCo dual‐atomic catalysts, demonstrating their ability to significantly enhance the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance of conventional PtCo catalysts. The half‐wave potential (E1/2) reaches 0.841 V in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution, and only a reduction of 12 mV in E1/2 is observed after 5000 cycles. Axial Cl proves to be resistant to removal during the electroreduction reaction. Consequently, the use of heteroatom‐modulated asymmetric structures can greatly improve the performance of Pt‐based catalysts. Incorporating nonmetallic synergistic Pt‐group metals presents a promising solution for achieving high‐performance Low‐PGMs.",

However, the formation of defects during the cycling process is still inevitable, and the exacerbation of defects would lead to the failure of the electrode, limiting the long‐term stability of the Zn anode. In recent years, self‐healing AEIs (SAEIs) have received great attention in Zn anode modification, as they can self‐heal and suppress the defects. This review summarizes the latest progress of SAEIs for Zn anode, including extrinsic and intrinsic SAEIs. Specifically, the design strategies and self‐healing mechanisms of SAEIs, their roles in stabilizing Zn anode, as well as the research methods for self‐healing performance, are discussed in detail.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Hofmeister effect has attracted considerable attention for its unique ability to modulate elasticity in flexible devices. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve complex procedures and yield unstable outcomes, the Hofmeister effect enables efficient and controllable elasticity tuning through specific ion‐material surface interactions. This mechanism allows precise regulation of surface wettability, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of elastic properties. The review systematically summarizes the research progress on the Hofmeister effect, including its concept, underlying mechanisms, and influencing factors, with a particular focus on its applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedical devices. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of ion‐induced material modulation, the review highlights the potential of the Hofmeister effect to advance the design of next‐generation smart materials.

Developing atomic‐level nanozymes is a promising approach. Despite their potential, atomic‐level high‐entropy nanozymes have not been reported due to thermodynamic instability. Therefore, developing atomic‐level high‐entropy nanozymes are of great significance. What's more, further exploring their biomedical applications can open up new horizons for nanozymology. Here, the atomic‐level high‐entropy nanozyme system capable of remarkable endogenous targeted catalysis and enhancing tumor photothermal therapy is successfully constructed. The system is prepared by reduction‐diffusion and grafting methods. The RuRhPtIrMo sub‐nanometer high‐entropy nanozyme (snHEAzyme) with about 8–10 atoms thickness is first prepared. Then, they are grafted by targeting agent DSPE‐PEG2000‐cRGD and imaging agent Cy7 to obtain the snHEAzyme@DSPE‐PEG2000‐cRGD@Cy7 nanozyme system. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE‐PEG2000‐cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase‐like activity and high absorbance in the near‐infrared (NIR) range. Under NIR irradiation, the nanozyme shows efficient photothermal conversion and reactive oxygen species generation effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE‐PEG2000‐cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors.

Introducing seed materials like single metals, metal oxides, and multielement/high‐entropy alloys enables the formation of core(seed)@shell (TMD) heterostructures.

However, metal entities spatial segregation within synergistic sites impedes the overall optimization and structure‐property analysis, and the support interface of the M1 and Mn sites critical for intermediate adsorption‐transfer kinetics has yet unexplored. Here, for the first time, interfacial modification strategy is proposed to modulate the interface and electronic structure of M1+Mn sites. This is systematically altered that the interface of Pd1+Pdn sites from hydroxyapatite (HAP) to nitrogen‐doped carbon‐modified HAP (NC/HAP) and pure NC, with all sites maintaining the comparable size and content. In the semi‐hydrogenation of alkynes, volcano‐type correlations between Pd1+Pdn sites with varying interfaces and hydrogenation activities are observed, peaking for those supported on NC/HAP. The obtained Pd1+Pdn@NC/HAP exhibits superior activity for alkynol‐to‐enol conversion, achieving a formation rate up to 3707.7 mol molPd−1 h−1 while maintaining 97.2% selectivity. Comprehensive investigations propose d‐band center of Pd1+Pdn sites with different interfaces as a descriptor to elucidate the volcano‐type correlation for various selective hydrogenation reactions.

To address this challenge, a smart DNA nanoframework capable of controlled co‐delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), hemin, and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to enable synergistic PDT for PDAC is developed. This nanoframework employs a hybridization chain reaction and phase transition to achieve high payload loading capacity while overcoming steric hindrance. The G‐quadruplex/hemin complex mimics horseradish peroxidase activity to convert endogenous H2O2 to O2, alleviating tumor hypoxia. Additionally, Cas9 RNP targets the nuclear factor E2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, downregulating Nrf2 expression and diminishing the antioxidant response, thereby enhancing ROS accumulation. The synergistic effect of O₂ generation and Nrf2 suppression significantly enhances ROS‐induced apoptosis in PDAC cells. In vitro, the system demonstrates efficient gene editing and robust downregulation of Nrf2, while in vivo studies in a PDAC mouse model reveal remarkable antitumor efficacy. This smart DNA nanoframework represents a promising strategy for enhancing PDT through precise genetic and biochemical modulation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrolyte engineering plays a crucial role in the design of high energy‐density lithium‐sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (Li‐SPAN) batteries, a promising energy storage technology. However, current predominant electrolyte systems face challenges of anode dendrite growth and cathode polysulfide loss, which limit the cycling stability of Li‐SPAN batteries. Here, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) primarily composed of diethoxy methane (DEM) is proposed to simultaneously address challenges at both electrodes. At the anode, DEM's weakly solvating capability accelerates both Li+ diffusion and desolvation, preventing out‐of‐plane Li deposition and dendrite formation caused by high concentration gradients at the anode surface. More significantly at the cathode, weakly solvated Li+ exhibits stronger Lewis acidity, preferentially stabilizing S32− intermediates via hard Lewis acid‐base interaction. These higher‐reduction‐state intermediates promote faster subsequent lithiation and deposition reactions, reducing polysulfide loss while improving both rate and cycling performance of the batteries. These performance enhancements and the corresponding mechanisms are supported by electrochemical and spectroscopic characterizations. With this WSE, Li‐SPAN batteries achieve exceptional cycling stability (0.087% capacity fade per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C), and pouch cell cycle life increases from 9 to 35 cycles with 90.6% capacity retention. This strategy provides valuable insights for developing high‐performance Li‐SPAN batteries.",

Herein, a combination strategy of simultaneous electronic engineering of linker and vitrification is adopted to optimize σLi+ for MOF‐based QSSEs. The introduction of an electrophilic ─Cl substituent in benzimidazole linker compels the electron to deviate from Zn2+ and modulates their charge distribution, which immobilizes bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions and thus boosts Li+ transference number. Meanwhile, the vitrification endows ZIF‐62 with the elimination of boundary resistance for high ionic conductivity. Consequently, ─Cl‐substituted glassy ZIF‐62 containing Li salt (Cl‐Li‐G62) showcases a high σLi+ of 4.89 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Impressively, Li metal batteries pair with LiFePO4 cathode and Cl‐Li‐G62 present an initial capacity of 145.4 mAh g−1 with a decay rate of 0.006% at 1C, and a superior rate performance of 79.5 mAh g−1 at 5C.

The structure of QCDs are analysed, and the results of molecular docking and cellular thermal‐shift assay confirmed RTKs as potential targets. Then the QCDs are incorporated into methacryloylated polyglutamic acid grafted with aminophenylboronic acid hydrogel with reactive oxygen species‐responsive properties. The QCDs can activate the Rap1 pathway in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, which can promote angiogenesis and translocation of β‐catenin to promote osteogenesis. Moreover, the Rap1 can also activate PI3K‐AKT pathway related to cell proliferation. For killing bacteria, the QCDs inhibit the gene expression of dapE, phoP, and secA2, which can disrupt the bacterial wall, inhibit drug resistance, and interfere with energy metabolism. This study reveals the chemical structure of QCDs, and finds they can interact with RTKs and thus activate the Rap1 signaling pathway to promote bone regeneration and kill bacteria by destroying their walls and interfering with energy metabolism, thus providing insights for developing a simplified component with multiple functions for repairing infectious bone defects.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFerroelectric semiconductors can exhibit extraordinarily long charge carrier lifetimes following photoexcitation. However, it remains unclear whether these long‐lived charge carriers are available to participate in the necessary solar water splitting redox reactions. Presented here are coupled transient optical and photoelectrochemical measurements that demonstrate the correlation between photo‐generated hole lifetimes, photocurrent density, and the energetic driving force associated with enhanced performance in ferroelectric BaTiO3 porous photoanodes with induced polarization states. For the first time, a three‐fold increase in photocurrent density following water‐oxidation‐preferential poling is correlated with a three orders of magnitude increase in hole lifetime in comparison to an un‐poled film. Transient absorption and photocurrent measurements demonstrate the polarized films benefit from reduced charge carrier recombination, enhanced charge carrier separation, increased hole population, and more efficient electron extraction over the water oxidation relevant timescales of µs to tens of seconds. Photoelectron spectroscopy and Kelvin probe measurements elucidate the effect of the presence and polarity of a ferroelectric polarization on core and band‐edge positions and work function values, ultimately revealing energy level differences of 300–400 meV that are found to be the driving force behind the associated lifetime and photocurrent gain.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNear‐bandgap photon recycling via distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) offers a promising strategy for maximizing light‐harvesting efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells with the minimum charge recombination. However, most DBR films require alternating deposition of inorganic layers via high‐vacuum equipment. Herein, all‐solution‐based DBR films, integrated via block copolymer (BCP) self‐assembly, are precisely tailored for various target wavelengths in the visible range. Using interfacial engineering of symmetric‐confinement, lamella‐forming polystyrene‐b‐poly(2‐vinylpyridine) (PS‐b‐P2VP) is self‐assembled into a defect‐free multilayer nanostructure oriented parallel to the substrates. When a weak hydroxy acid, lactic acid (LA), is incorporated into the 2VP units, the P2VP domains are favorably swollen and protonated; this causes the lamellar structures to become more asymmetric, whereas uniaxially sharp interfaces between the lamellar microdomains are retained. The reflected wavelength (λm) for the BCP‐based DBR films is cooperatively tuned by controlling the cross‐linking density in the P2VP domains immediately before the LA incorporation. The narrow‐width, high‐reflectance BCP‐based DBR films are integrated into the rear of the BiVO4 photoanodes to scrutinize the optimal λm for the best PEC performance. A remarkable increase in the current density is attributed to the redshift of the effective working wavelengths in the BiVO4 photoanode during the photon‐recycling process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCollagen aging, which results from senescent nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, is a key factor in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Traditional therapies that target the removal of senescent cells fail to address the underlying problem of collagen aging. Therefore, surface‐bound gene‐functionalized injectable short fibers are developed to inhibit collagen aging using a combination of plasma discharge modification and oxidative‐responsive liposomes. Initially, oxidative‐responsive liposomes are prepared by integrating p16‐siRNA with an oxidation‐sensitive phospholipid. Surface‐bound gene‐functionalized injectable short fibers (p16‐LP@SF) are then developed by grafting liposomes onto plasma‐activated carboxylated short fibers. In vitro experiments demonstrate that p16‐LP@SF triggers the release of p16‐LP from carboxylated short fibers through “broken bond” detachment in response to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the IDD microenvironment, and effectively inhibited senescence in NP cells. In vivo studies reveal that p16‐LP@SF promotes the production of collagen type II (COL‐II) and rebuilt the extracellular matrix (ECM). RNA‐sequencing analysis reveals that p16‐LP@SF significantly increases collagen deposition and inhibits collagen aging by activating the TGF‐β and BMP signaling pathways. In this study, short fibers designed to remodel the ECM of the NP are developed for the first time, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for IDD by reversing collagen aging.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs a promising material of photodetectors (PDs), antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) and its heterostructure own the advantages of low cost, high absorption coefficient, and excellent optoelectrical properties. However, the imaging application of the Sb2Se3‐based PD array is blocked by the key barrier of crosstalk following the single‐pixel device study. Here, the crosstalk in the Sb2Se3‐based PD array is suppressed with a facile surface modification. Using the UV‐ozone treatment, compatible with integrated circuit production, the ZnO/Sb2Se3/Sb2O3 heterostructure is fabricated via the oxidation of the Sb2Se3 surface, and owns enhanced detectivity of 3.63 × 1011 Jones and broadband photodetection from UVto near‐infrared region. Moreover, the electrical crosstalk between the pixels is suppressed from 91.06% to 5.37%, improving the imaging contrast. Despite the additional oxide layer, the response time remains at the nanosecond level of 298 and 287 ns, facilitating applications such as real‐time imaging. This work provides an effective way with surface modification to suppress the crosstalk in the Sb2Se3‐based PD array and breaks the key limit in its photoelectric imaging applications. It is also applicable to various materials, such as GeSe, Sb2Te3, and Bi2Se3, which will also open a new window for semiconductor industrialization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRegulating the microstructure of hard carbon (HC) anodes has emerged as a popular strategy to enhance the application potential of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, the low platform capacity and inferior rate property remain significant barriers to their further development. Herein, HC materials with abundant ultramicropores (0.3‐0.8 nm) are prepared employed epoxy resin and zinc acetate as precursors. Benefiting from the abundant hydroxyl and epoxy groups, the synergistic generation of simple aromatic free radicals and the precipitated ZnO promote the cross‐linking between precursor molecules during the first‐step pyrolysis, alter the twisting and folding of carbon layers during high‐temperature calcniantion, thereby precisely regulating the micropore structure of HC. Owing to its abundant ultramicropore structure and the boosted Na+ transfer dynamics, the optimal anode demonstrates a superior plateau capacity of 256.2 mAh g−1 at 30 mA g−1 (408.0 mAh g−1 reversible capacity) and rate capability of 317.0 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, outperforming most other resin‐derived carbon materials. In situ Raman combined with in situ XRD testing results demonstrate that the well‐designed HC presents a typical “adsorption‐intercalation‐pore filling” sodium storage mechanism. This work provides a theoretical basis and experimental guidance for high‐performance HC derived from epoxy resin, which is essential for advancements in SIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAnti‐counterfeiting technology is crucial for ensuring the authenticity of currency, identification documents, and high‐value products. To address the growing sophistication of counterfeit techniques, a multi‐layered anti‐counterfeiting platform is developed based on an azopolymer (PAzo) system that integrates challenge‐response authentication and physically unclonable function (PUF)‐like characteristics within a unified framework. By leveraging the molecular orientation control of PAzo under linearly polarized light (LPL), encrypted patterns are fabricated that remain invisible under standard conditions and require polarized optical microscopy (POM) for decryption. The fabrication process involves sequential LPL exposures with patterned masks, inducing spatially defined anisotropic molecular alignment, potentially enabling PUF‐like authentication through unique structural variations. To further enhance security, two dynamic anti‐counterfeiting strategies are introduced: 1) dynamic dual pattern anti‐counterfeiting, which encodes multiple polarization‐dependent patterns that appear sequentially under POM as the analyzer is rotated, 2) Moiré pattern animation anti‐counterfeiting, which encodes multiple patterns into a single composite structure that requires a predefined scan pattern for decryption. These multi‐dimensional decryption conditions significantly increase security by introducing both physical and optical constraints. This PAzo‐based approach offers a scalable and adaptive authentication solution, providing enhanced protection against increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting threats.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSoft carbons with inherently high graphitization degree typically suffer from limited specific capacity and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) for Na+‐ion batteries (NIBs), hindering their development and practical application. Herein, defect and oxygen functional group engineering strategy by incorporating resin‐derived hard carbon and cost‐effective iron‐based substances is proposed enables the design of a unique layered soft carbon with enhanced efficiency and stable interfaces with the electrolytes. The increased C═O functional groups and Fe─O─C bond contributed by Fe‐based species significantly improve reversible Na+‐ adsorption in the inclined region and enhance the structural stability of the electrode. Additionally, phenolic resin‐derived carbon increases the micropores and thus reduces the graphitization degree. The increased closed pores induced by the reconstruction of the carbon structure at high temperature enhance the Na+‐storage ability. Consequently, the material achieves a high Na+‐storage capacity of 311.0 mAh g−1 with an improved ICE of 93.89% at 0.1 A g−1. Even cycled at 1 A g−1, it can deliver a high capacity of 269.3 mAh g−1 with excellent stability over 800 cycles, outperforming previously reported soft carbon anodes. This innovative strategy provides a practical and cost‐effective pathway for designing advanced carbon anodes for NIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRapid and targeted intervention during sudden mercury pollution incidents can significantly mitigate the harmful effects of mercury dissemination. Mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are demonstrated great promise for mercury wastewater purification, owing to their exceptional adsorption capacity. However, these materials often underperform at exceptionally high or low Hg(II) concentrations, limiting their use in emergencies. To address this issue, this study leverages nanostructure engineering techniques and, for the first time, fine‐tunes the proportion of surfactants to construct a thiol‐functionalized UiO‐66 MOF (Nic‐UiO‐66‐SH) with size‐adjustable nano‐ion channels for rapid Hg(II) pollution management in emergency contexts. The Nic‐UiO‐66‐SH, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 1695.87 mg g−1, can quickly and effectively adsorb Hg(II) at extreme concentrations (10–600 mg L−1) within 2.5–105 min, bringing the concentration down to drinking water standards (−1). This superior performance is attributed to the concentration‐specific adsorption mechanism of ions in adaptive nano‐ion channels based on Debye radius theory, which guides the precise control of channel size. Molecular simulations further validate the significant role of ion channels in optimizing Hg(II) diffusion and adsorption. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for the development of emergency wastewater purification materials and promotes their practical application in pollution response scenarios.",

In‐situ Raman spectroscopy, pH‐dependence activity test, and electronic structure calculations revealed that Fe not only promotes the oxidation of adjacent Ni but also accelerates the deprotonation of ‐OH groups and stabilizes oxo‐intermediates, thus displaying both direct and indirect effects and enhancing the overall OER performance.

However, their development is hindered by persistent challenges, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), dendrite formation, sluggish kinetics, and active species crossover. Chelation engineering offers a transformative approach for overcoming these obstacles. By modifying the coordination environment of metal ions, chelation directly inﬂuences the electrochemical properties of metal ions and the thermodynamics of redox reactions, leading to significant improvements in battery efficiency, cycle stability, and system scalability compared to conventional IRFBs. This work highlights the potential of chelation engineering in optimizing IRFB performance and outlines key research priorities to advance the development of chelated IRFBs for grid‐scale energy storage applications.",

This study explores the impact of alcoholic anti‐solvents as eco‐friendly alternatives to the commonly used chlorobenzene (CB) on the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films, including crystallization, film quality, and defect density in perovskite films. Our findings show that 1‐butanol (BuOH) is the most effective, promoting both primary and secondary crystallization, reducing defects, and enhancing film quality. Time‐dependent studies indicate that shorter BuOH application times improves crystalline growth, albeit with some impact on surface morphology. A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.45% along with an open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.223 V is achieved in perovskite solar cells with a bandgap of 1.59 eV, highlighting the potential of alcoholic anti‐solvents for enhancing performance and offering a sustainable, scalable solution for high‐efficiency device fabrication.",

    "abstract": "Preparative protein crystallization is regarded as an economically sustainable protein purification alternative to chromatography in biotechnological downstream processing. However, protein crystallization is a not-well-understood process that is usually slow and poorly reproducible. A promising strategy for enhancing protein crystallization is exploiting the metastable liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of protein solutions. Here, we report an enhancement of lysozyme-crystallization yield by using a combination of two additives under LLPS conditions. The first additive, NaCl (0.15 M), is necessary to introduce protein–protein attractive interactions and induce LLPS by lowering temperature. The second additive, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonate (HEPES, 0.10 M, pH 7.4), accumulates in the metastable protein-rich liquid phase and thermodynamically stabilizes lysozyme crystals. We found that this combination of additives leads to crystallization yields of higher than 90% under LLPS conditions at a lysozyme concentration of 5% by weight and a fairly low ionic strength (0.2 M) within an operational time of the order of one hour. This crystallization yield is more than three-fold larger than that obtained from samples containing NaCl without HEPES at the same pH and ionic strength. Moreover, we determined crystallization yield as a function of incubation time, and temperature below and above the LLPS boundary. As crystallization temperature intersects with LLPS temperature, a significant increase in crystallization yield is observed. This is consistent with LLPS boosting protein crystallization. Our work suggests a possible strategy for increasing the crystallization success of other proteins, with applications in protein purification.",

The possibility of modulating the adipogenic differentiation of hASCs is crucial in improving their therapeutic potential. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid isolated from Cannabis sativa L., on hASCs. Few studies have evaluated its role in stem cell (SC) properties and their differentiation potential. hASCs were first treated with different concentrations of CBD (ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM) to assess its effects on viability, demonstrating that this molecule is non-toxic, except at the concentration of 10 μM. Subsequently, the role of CBD in the proliferation, metabolism and adipogenic potential of hASCs was analyzed. CBD promoted adipogenesis in a dose-dependent manner, even in the absence of differentiation medium. This result was evidenced by the presence of lipid vacuoles, the expression of adipogenic markers, cytoskeletal actin rearrangement and modulation in the expression of osteogenic genes. Although the results indicated a role of CBD in promoting hASC adipogenesis, further research will be needed to explore the mechanism of action of CBD in SC differentiation and to deepen its utility in SC-based approaches.",

Compounds of the general formula [UM(OtBu)6] (UM-OtBu-type: M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) were obtained by: (i) reacting [U(OtBu)5(py)] with equimolar amounts of alkali metal silylamides in tert-butyl alcohol, and (ii) oxidative transformation of [UM2(OtBu)6] (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) upon reaction with iodine. Trans-alcoholysis of uranium heterobimetallic tert-butoxides with sterically less demanding iso-propyl alcohol yields oligomeric or polymeric iso-propoxide derivatives of the general formula [UM(OiPr)6]n, where the nuclearity depends on the alkali metal (n = 2 for M = Li; n = ∞ for M = Na, K, Rb). The capacity of alkali metal ions to adopt flexible coordination geometries results in different structural types ranging from finite clusters to infinite chains, with [ULi(OiPr)6]2 (ULi-OiPr-1) found to be dimeric, whereas [UM(OiPr)6]∞ (UM-OiPr-2-type, M = Na, K) and [URb(OiPr)6]∞ (URb-OiPr-3) exhibit a polymeric architecture. These findings provide fresh insights into the structure-directing influence of alkali metals on actinide coordination chemistry and broaden the chemistry of actinide alkoxides.

The results highlight that no significant antifouling activity was measured for the metal free polyazamacrocyclic derivatives.

Overall, in most cases, Zn complexes showed better activity than the Cu complexes, revealing the importance of the metal cation.

Crystal violet (CV) staining revealed that it inhibited MRSA biofilm formation and electron microscopy revealed that it disrupted bacterial cell division and, possibly, the synthesis of essential cell wall proteins. In both in vivo models, PL-W exhibited excellent performance. In the Galleria mellonella infection model, treatment with different concentrations of PL-W increased the survival rate from 20% to 90% and significantly reduced the bacterial load. In the mouse model of MRSA pneumonia, a 10 mg/kg dose of PL-W increased the survival rate to 70%, decreased the bacterial load in the lungs, and alleviated inflammatory damage. Molecular docking studies indicated that PL-W had a similar docking pose and comparable binding affinity to that of lefamulin, with hydrogen bond interactions that are crucial for binding to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Moreover, it demonstrated no significant reduction in cell viability in HepG2 and HEK293 cells, even at high concentrations (≤50 µg/mL).

Within the colony, communication between individuals and castes is crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Such complex interactions are possible thanks to semiochemicals called pheromones. The spectrum of pheromonal communication in bee colonies is wide and differs between castes, especially the queen and the workers. Gland morphology and compounds of secretions result in alterations in both physiological and behavioral responses to certain pheromones in castes. The queen’s glands produce pheromones that maintain her reign and induce division of labor among workers. Workers’ pheromones are adapted to multiple tasks performed by this caste within the colony. This review outlines a neurophysiological pathway in the perception pheromone molecule, with a specific description of the individual anatomical structures essential for the path, such as the morphology of antennae, sensilla, antennal lobes and mushroom bodies. Later on, the study provides insight into specific aspects of the differences between the two castes (queen and workers) in terms of complex pheromonal communication in the hive, by describing the pheromones present in it (QMP, tergal gland pheromone, Dufour gland pheromone, Nasonov pheromone, sting alarm pheromone and tarsal gland pheromone).",

This review explores the role of both covalent (e.g., fluorination, hydrogenation, cycloadditions, aryldiazonium salt reduction, organometallic ion attachment, carboxylation, amidation, esterification, and metallic nanoparticle attachments) and non-covalent functionalization methods (e.g., surfactant coating, polymer wrapping, biomolecule attachment, and polymer encapsulation) in enhancing CNT biocompatibility and diagnostic efficiency. Functionalized CNTs are extensively applied in cancer detection through highly sensitive biosensors, including electrochemical, optical, and field-effect transistor-based systems, capable of detecting various cancer biomarkers with exceptional sensitivity. Additionally, they offer significant advantages in cancer imaging modalities such as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound imaging, improving contrast, resolution, and specificity.

Chemical analyses comprised polyphenol, flavonoid, anthocyanin, carotenoid, sugar, and vitamin C content, as well as antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS, reducing power). Thermal and structural stability were examined via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Fermentation significantly increased the counts of lactic acid bacteria, achieving 8.38 and 7.86 log CFU/g after freeze-drying, respectively. While total polyphenols slightly decreased (by 9.5% and 1.1% for L. plantarum and F. fructivorans, respectively), flavonoid content increased notably by 16.1% in F. fructivorans-fermented samples. Antioxidant activities, assessed by ABTS and DPPH assays, were largely maintained, although a reduction in reducing power was observed. Additionally, fermentation led to sucrose hydrolysis, resulting in higher glucose and fructose contents, and increased water content in the final products. Minor increases in total fungal counts were noted after freeze-drying but remained within acceptable limits. Overall, the combination of fermentation and freeze-drying processes preserved key antioxidant properties, enhanced microbial safety, and produced functional peach-based products with improved bioactivity and extended shelf life. These findings highlight the potential of fermented freeze-dried peaches as innovative, health-oriented alternatives to traditional fruit snacks.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how different types of microplastics (MPs)—fibers, glitter, plastic bags, and plastic bottles—influence heavy metal uptake in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), a commonly consumed leafy vegetable. A controlled eight-week pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using contaminated loamy sand soil (polluted with Cd, Pb, Cu, and other metals) collected from a smelter-impacted area. Microplastics were added at a concentration of 70–80 mg/kg, and lettuce seedlings were grown under phytotron conditions (22 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5% RH, 16 h light/8 h dark) without fertilizers or external contaminants. Plant roots and shoots were harvested, and heavy metals were analyzed via MP-AES and ICP-MS. The results showed that MPs altered heavy metal mobility, bioavailability, and plant uptake. Copper accumulation in leaves decreased substantially across MP treatments, from 80.84 mg/kg in the control to 26.35 mg/kg (glitter), whereas lead and cadmium concentrations increased significantly in roots under fiber and glitter exposure (Pb increased from 12.13 mg/kg to 33.57 mg/kg and Cd from 1.70 mg/kg to 2.05 mg/kg in fiber treatment). Cobalt accumulation in leaves increased under the plastic bag treatment, indicating MP-specific metal interactions. Root growth was also affected, with fibers promoting elongation and plastic bottles restricting it. Sequential extraction revealed that MPs modified metal partitioning in soil, with Pb and Ni more strongly retained in stable fractions under some treatments. Observed trends in soil pH and organic matter content were associated with changes in metal mobility, highlighting the potential role of soil properties in mediating microplastic–metal interactions. These findings highlight the role of MPs as mediators of heavy metal transport in crops and underscore the need for clear regulatory guidelines that limit microplastic contamination in agricultural soils and promote routine monitoring to safeguard food safety and crop health.",

The phenolic compounds (PCs) they contain can be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries but require qualitative and quantitative analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which phenolic compounds profiles depend on cultivar, plant organ, and plant level. This paper shows for the first time that for hop, it is not only the plant organ that is important for PC content, but also the level from which it is obtained. Metabolites were investigated in cones, leaves, and stalks at three levels of the plant in Polish hop cultivars (Marynka, Lubelski, and Magnum). The PC content showed a differentiation due to the cultivar of hops, their anatomical part, and position in the plant (level), which reflects the degree of organ maturity. The total PC was the highest in leaves (up to 922 mg/100 g), while lower contents were found in cones (up to 421 mg/100 g) and stalks (up to 105 mg/100 g). The main PCs of leaves were kaempferol-3-glucoside (up to 328 mg/100 g) and rutin (up to 293 mg/100 g), while rutin dominated in cones (up to 209 mg/100 g).",

Additionally, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was conducted to analyze the alterations in the intestinal microbiota. The findings indicate that the administration of CEO in mice infected with C. albicans resulted in a normalization of body weight and an improvement in their symptoms. Histological analysis utilizing HE and PAS staining demonstrated that CEO exerted beneficial effects on the intestinal mucosal status of these infected mice. Furthermore, ELISA results revealed a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17A within the small intestinal tissues of C. albicans-infected mice. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that CEO effectively enhanced the richness and diversity within the intestinal microbiota of CEO treatment groups of mice that were investigated. Overall, CEO exhibits therapeutic potential against inflammation induced by intestinal C. albicans infection in mice.

However, its pH sensitivity, protein cross-linking properties, and susceptibility to oxidation restrict its application. To address these challenges, W/O/W multiple emulsified TA microcapsules were developed using soybean protein isolate (SPI) as the natural wall material emulsifier through a two-step emulsification and spray drying process. The encapsulation efficiency of the obtained TA microcapsules was 87.6%, and TA’s thermal stability was significantly improved. TA microcapsules effectively reduced the acidity and irritability of TA, eliminated protein flocculation, and enhanced biocompatibility. Notably, the cell viability of the TA microcapsule (>94%) was significantly higher than free TA (65.6%). The storage stability test revealed that the microcapsules maintained structural integrity, with a retention rate of 96% after 10 days of storage. In vitro release studies of TA microcapsules demonstrated a sustained-release effect within 24 h. Simulated digestion studies further elucidated the protective effect of microcapsules on TA during gastric digestion. These multi-structured microcapsules based on SPI effectively address the limitations associated with TA utilization and enhance its potential for dual oral/transdermal administration in biomedical and cosmetic applications.",

A major challenge in downstream processing is the removal of antibody aggregates, which can compromise drug safety, efficacy, and regulatory compliance. This review explores the use of multimodal chromatography for aggregate separation, providing an in-depth analysis of commercially available resins and emerging adsorbent prototypes. It also examines the mechanisms of aggregate formation during bioprocessing. A comparative evaluation of conventional single-mode chromatography techniques—affinity, ion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction—is presented alongside multimodal chromatography, which integrates ion-exchange, hydrophobic, and other non-covalent interactions for enhanced aggregate clearance and process flexibility. The review primarily assesses commercial multimodal resins in terms of aggregate removal efficiency, binding capacity, and scalability. Additionally, advancements in prototype resins and multimodal membranes are discussed. Finally, the advantages, limitations, and future directions of multimodal chromatography in mAb aggregate removal are outlined. As purification demands continue to evolve, multimodal chromatography is poised to play an increasingly critical role in achieving the high purity standards required for therapeutic antibodies.",

This work aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of cowpea plant extracts. Grain, pod and leaf extracts from five Portuguese cowpea accessions were characterized in terms of their phenolic content. The values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined against pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, as well as on post-harvest pathogenic filamentous fungi. In general, the phenolic content of pod extracts was higher than that of grains and leaves, although leaf extracts had the highest content of a broad-spectrum antibacterial flavonoid, quercetin. Grain extracts exhibited no detectable antimicrobial activity. In contrast, leaf and pod extracts from all five accessions generally displayed bactericidal effects. For bacteria, pod extracts showed MICs ranging from 5.1 to 87.7 mg/mL and MBCs from 20.3 to 87.7 mg/mL. Leaf extracts showed the most promising results, with MICs and MBCs ranging from 1.1 to 9.1 mg/mL. The results against fungi were not so expressive; nevertheless, P. expansum was inhibited by 9 L leaf extract even if at a higher concentration (MIC = 18 mg/mL) than those obtained for bacteria. The Portuguese variety Fradel (1E) showed very promising antibacterial activity, with leaf extracts showing low MBC values (from 2.3 to 9.1 mg/mL). The obtained results indicate that cowpea pods and leaves have antimicrobial properties and could potentially be used as a source of compounds for food preservation.",

    "abstract": "The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value-added multi-carbon C2+ products holds significant promise for sustainable chemical synthesis and carbon-neutral energy cycles. Among the various strategies developed to enhance CO2RR, the use of ionic liquids (ILs) has emerged as a powerful approach for modulating the local microenvironment and electronic structure of Cu-based metal catalysts. In this study, to unravel the molecular-level mechanisms underlying these enhancements, density functional theory calculations (DFTs) were employed to systematically explore how ILs with different terminal groups modulate the electronic reconstruction of the Cu surface, further affecting the *CO–*CO coupling and product selectivity. Electronic structure analyses reveal that ILs bearing polar moieties (–SH, –COOH) can synergistically enhance the interfacial electron accumulation and induce an upshift of the Cu d-band center, thereby strengthening *CO adsorption. In contrast, nonpolar IL (CH3) exhibits negligible effects, underscoring the pivotal role of ILs’ polarity in catalyst surface-state engineering. The free energy diagrams and transition state analyses reveal that ILs with polar groups significantly lower both the reaction-free energy and activation barrier associated with the *CO–*CO coupling step. This energetic favorability selectively inhibits the C1 product pathways and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), further improving the selectivity of C2 products. These theoretical insights not only unveil the mechanistic origins of IL-induced performance enhancement but also offer predictive guidance for the rational design of advanced IL–catalyst systems for efficient CO2 electroreduction.",

In recent years, it has become clear that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is involved in disruption of the structural integrity of the BBB. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway has a negative effect on the functioning of the cellular elements of the neurovascular unit that form the BBB. The aim of this review is to assess the role of the JNK signaling pathway in the disruption of the structural integrity of the BBB in animal models of stroke (MCAO/R, middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion), Alzheimer’s disease, and brain tumors and to analyze the effects of compounds of various natures that directly or indirectly affect the activity of the JNK signaling pathway. These compounds can reduce damage to the BBB and brain edema, reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, reduce the expression of proapoptotic factors, and increase the expression of tight junction proteins. Certain compounds mitigate BBB dysfunction, being promising candidates for neuroprotective therapies. These agents exert their effects, in part, through inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, a mechanism linked to reduced neuronal damage and improved BBB integrity.",

Oxidative stress is an important mechanism in the induction of many diseases. The present study investigates the antioxidative mechanism of Astragaloside IV in zebrafish, using menaquinone exposure to induce oxidative stress conditions. The findings revealed that AS-IV effectively attenuated oxidative stress-induced mortality and morphological abnormalities in zebrafish. AS-IV exhibited a concentration-dependent protective effect against developmental abnormalities, with progressive reduction in pericardial effusion, body curvature, and growth retardation observed at higher doses. Moreover, AS-IV treatment not only effectively reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and attenuated oxidative DNA damage but also significantly decreased apoptosis in the cardiac region of zebrafish embryos under oxidative stress conditions. Western blot analysis revealed that AS-IV treatment significantly reduced the protein levels of both Cleaved Caspase-3 and γ-H2AX, indicating its ability to inhibit DNA damage-induced apoptosis. AS-IV mediates its antioxidant defense mechanisms through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway, inducing the significant upregulation of cytoprotective enzymes. This molecular mechanism underlies the observed phenotypic improvements in oxidative stress-related damage. Upstream analysis demonstrated that AS-IV activates NRF2 primarily through protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) pathway modulation, independent of KEAP1 regulation. Comprehensive mechanistic analysis reveals that Astragaloside IV mitigates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in zebrafish through coordinated regulation of the AKT/NRF2/HO-1/Caspase-3 signaling axis.",

The ideal conditions for AGPL extraction were the following: liquid to solid ratio of 35.5 mL/g, ultrasonic power of 697 W and extraction duration of 46 min. Under those conditions, the actual AGPL yield was 15.32% ± 0.12%. The statistical analysis showed that both models could predict AGPL yield well and GA-ANN had relatively higher accuracy in the prediction of AGPL output, supported by the coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9809) in GA-based ANN compared to R2 = 0.9145 in RSM, as well as lower values for mean squared error (MSE = 0.0279), root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.1669) and absolute average deviation (AAD = 0.1336) in the GA-ANN model.

The results indicated that they showed high docking scores of affinities with the proteins in the NF-κB, AMPK, and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Among them, cucurbitane triterpenes with sugar moiety substitution at C-3 and C-26/27 showed better affinity ability.

    "abstract": "Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) is an underutilized leguminous crop, with its grains consumed differently, especially in developing countries. Bambara groundnut (BGN) is the cheapest source of protein and a rich source of dietary fiber, carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals. It also contains a variety of non-nutritional components known as phytochemicals. The phytochemicals in BGN include polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, phytic acid, oxalate, and trypsin inhibitors. Nevertheless, some phytochemicals are classified as antinutrients because they impair nutrient absorption. Bambara groundnut also contains metabolites, such as epicatechin, catechin, procyanidin, esters, and citric acid. Bioprocessing, such as dehulling, germination, malting, fermentation, ultrasonication, micronization, and others, reduces BGN flour’s antinutrients. However, bioprocessing may increase or decrease the levels of metabolites in BGN flour. For example, fermentation increases esters, whereas malting decreases them. Various studies have reported the use of BGN flour in bakery products, meat products, non-alcoholic beverages, pasta, and others. Thus, this study aimed to review the influence of bioprocessing on the nutritional quality, antinutrients, functional characteristics, and metabolites of BGN flour and its potential food applications. This study will explore the health benefits of bioprocessed BGN flour and promote its use in various food products.",

    "abstract": "CO2-responsive polymers have emerged as a significant class of smart materials, distinguished by their ability to reversibly alter their properties upon exposure to CO2. Due to CO2’s abundant availability, low cost, non-toxicity, energy efficiency, and excellent biocompatibility, these polymers offer remarkable environmental and practical advantages. This review succinctly explores recent advancements in the synthesis, mechanisms, and applications of CO2-responsive polymers, emphasizing the pivotal roles of specific acidic and basic functional groups such as carboxylic acids, phenolic groups, amines, amidines, guanidines, and imidazoles. Advanced polymerization techniques including free radical polymerization (FRP), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) are critically evaluated for their precision and flexibility in polymer design. Significant applications in smart separation, carbon capture, drug delivery, desalination, emulsions, tissue engineering, and sensing technologies are discussed comprehensively. Although substantial progress has been made, ongoing challenges include enhancing response speed, durability, sustainability, and economic viability. Future research is recommended to focus on innovative polymer structures, computational modeling, hybrid materials, and greener synthesis methods. This review aims to inspire continued exploration and practical utilization of CO2-responsive polymers to address pressing environmental and technological needs.",

MXene was delaminated with CMC in water. Electron microscopy confirmed the 2D layered structure of MX_CMC, which demonstrated 60% higher dispersibility in aqueous media compared to MX alone. The nanoplatform showed high cytocompatibility with human adult dermal fibroblasts (HADF) and positively impacted cell migration, fibroblast differentiation, and VEGF expression. In vitro tube formation study with human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) further confirmed the angiogenic nature of MX_CMC. A low expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL‐6 and TNF‐α) in the U937 cell line upon treatment with MX_CMC implied the non‐immunogenic nature of the material. MX_CMC showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and B. subtilis, including biofilm prevention. In vivo testing in a rat model of infected diabetic chronic wounds yielded promising therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we have successfully prepared delaminated 2D Ti3C2 MXene in an environment‐friendly way, which not only exhibits long‐term dispersibility in biologically relevant aqueous media, but also possesses excellent antimicrobial, angiogenic, anti‐inflammatory, and wound healing properties. In conclusion, MX_CMC could be a potential multifunctional nanoplatform for biomedical applications, especially for wound healing.",

Despite the large amount of Au nanoclusters (co‐)protected by organic nitrogen ligands, little has been known about those containing dynamically labile Au─N bonds, where the hemilabile ligands are solely limited to pyridyl‐phosphine. In this study, we chose imidazolyl‐phosphine (dpim) as the main protecting ligand and synthesized a new tetracationic cluster [Au20(dpim)6(dppe)2Cl2]4+ (Au20‐S, dppe = Ph2P(CH2)2PPh2), which was structurally characterized crystallographically, spectroscopically, and computationally. Albeit the similar electronic structure of the Au20 core, Au20‐S possesses different ligand arrangements and positive charges from those of its two reported structural analogues, and thus they may serve as an ideal cluster triad for comparatively studying the ligand/charge effect on their catalytic activities. This work proved the potential of imidazolyl phosphine as a versatile hemilabile ligand in the syntheses of Au NCs with labile Au─N bonds. The imidazolyl‐phosphines are more amenable to derivatizations, which provides a new opportunity for further enriching the library of hemilabile ligand‐protected Au NCs with potentially better catalytic performance.",

Careful choice of starting substrates led to the synthesis of organoselenium variants of some possible metal‐coordinating ligands having structural similarities with several known ligands in the area of coordination chemistry. The present approach was explored further for gram‐scale synthesis of 2‐phenyl‐benzoselenazole. Moreover, the possible impact of structural aspects particularly remote functionalization in altering the chalcogen bonding interactions (CBIs) at the molecular level in solid‐state has been demonstrated.

In situ reactivity studies in the H2 atmosphere of these samples employing XANES data, recorded during the heating and cooling cycle, revealed the extent of Ce4+ conversion to Ce3+. Most importantly the stability of converted Ce3+ appears to depend on the presence of reducible transition metal, where the presence of copper ions indeed decreased the reduction temperature of Ce4+ and upon cooling the formed Ce3+ appears to be stable in a reducing atmosphere. In the absence of copper, not only is the extent of reduction to Ce3+ much less compared with the copper‐containing samples but also, the reduced Ce3+ ions appear to reoxidise to Ce4+ upon cooling to room temperature. These results are in line with observed results of powder CeO2 samples typically used as catalyst supports.",

The methodology exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to both cyclic acetals and alkynes, delivering a variety of deconjugated alkene products in moderate to excellent yields and with high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, isotopic labeling, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide strong evidence for a sequential regioselective hydrogen atom transfer (RHAT)/radical addition/RHAT/C─O cleavage sequence.

Recent advancements in lignin fractionation and cellulose processing have enabled the production of bio‐based CFs with tensile strengths approaching 1.72 and 172 GPa of moduli, narrowing the gap with petroleum‐based counterparts. Innovations in stabilization and carbonization, including low‐energy microwave techniques, have reduced energy requirements by up to 30%, enhancing economic feasibility. Despite these advances, challenges persist, such as the heterogeneity of lignin precursors, high production costs, and scalability barriers, which currently limit widespread adoption. Future opportunities lie in tailoring precursor molecular structures through genetic engineering and developing hybrid materials that combine bio‐based and traditional fibers to optimize performance. With the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 50% and utilize abundant industrial by‐products, bio‐based CFs represent a pivotal step toward sustainable high‐performance materials. These fibers promise transformative impacts across sectors such as supercapacitors, batteries, biosensors, biocatalytic materials and automotive, aligning material innovation with global environmental goals.",

However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO\n            2\n            efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC.

    "abstract": "The human landscape in East and Southeast Asia is vastly complex, and successful retrieval of genome-wide data from prehistoric humans of southern East Asia is sparse. We successfully sampled 127 ancient human genomes from southwestern China. A 7100-year-old female individual from central Yunnan shows a previously unsampled Basal Asian ancestry related to a ghost population that contributed to Tibetan Plateau populations. Central Yunnan populations dating to 5500 to 1400 years before present show an East Asian ancestry distinct from northern or southern East Asian ancestries that contributed to present-day East and Southeast Asians, particularly Austroasiatic speakers, and emphasizes the importance of the Red River valley for proto-Austroasiatic population history. Diverse Asian ancestries are represented in humans sampled from Yunnan, clarifying past population dynamics related to both Tibetan and Austroasiatic origins.",

BRAF regulation, involving monomeric autoinhibition and activation by dimerization, has been intensely scrutinized, but mechanisms enabling oncogenic mutants to evade regulation remain unclear. By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix αC displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix αC in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds.",

By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years. Our study proposes a model that explains how adaptive phenotypes can evolve rapidly without affecting related essential functions.",

However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5\n            ASB7\n            E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, thereby ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.",

Using ~700 accessions across Asia, we show that the initial domestication happened three to five thousand years ago in central Japan during the Jomon period, followed by a range expansion into China and secondary hybridization with Chinese wild populations. We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution (\n            VaPAP1\n            for loss of mottled black and\n            VaANR1\n            for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication.",

Here, we describe PromoterAI, a deep neural network that accurately identifies non-coding promoter variants which dysregulate gene expression. We show that promoter variants with predicted expression-altering consequences produce outlier expression at both RNA and protein levels in thousands of individuals, and that these variants experience strong negative selection in human populations. We observe that clinically relevant genes in rare disease patients are enriched for such variants and validate their functional impact through reporter assays. Our estimates suggest that promoter variation accounts for 6% of the genetic burden associated with rare diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits1–8. Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres9,10. However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry11–22. Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability1. Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined2–4. However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals5. Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions6–8, but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          \n            Cannabis sativa is a globally important seed oil, fibre and drug-producing plant species. However, a century of prohibition has severely restricted development of breeding and germplasm resources, leaving potential hemp-based nutritional and fibre applications unrealized. Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized.",

However, increasing the band gap when the Al content surpasses  ~80% leads to problems with n-type doping of AlGaN alloys with the standard choice of Si donors, due to the formation of the so-called negative Si DX center. In this paper, we show that the amphoteric nature of the Si dopant in AlGaN alloys is fundamentally controlled by the local environment and the ordering of the Ga and Al atoms in the vicinity of the Si atom. Our conclusions are based on advanced characterization sensitive to the local environment of defects and impurities, complemented by electronic structure calculations. We propose that spatial ordering of Ga and Si atoms could allow efficient n-type doping at even higher Al contents, including AlN.",

Nearly half of HCCs are Wnt-active with mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for β-catenin), AXIN1/2, or APC, and demonstrate heterogeneous and limited benefit to ICI due to an immune excluded tumor microenvironment. We show significant tumor responses in multiple β-catenin-mutated immunocompetent HCC models to a novel siRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle targeting CTNNB1 (LNP-CTNNB1). Both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cellular and zonal reprogramming, along with activation of immune regulatory transcription factors IRF2 and POU2F1, re-engaged type I/II interferon signaling, and alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity upon β-catenin suppression with LNP-CTNNB1 at early- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, ICI enhances response to LNP-CTNNB1 in advanced-stage disease by preventing T cell exhaustion and through formation of lymphoid aggregates (LA). In fact, expression of an LA-like gene signature prognosticates survival for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the IMbrave150 phase III trial and inversely correlates with CTNNB1-mutatational status in this patient cohort. In conclusion, LNP-CTNNB1 is efficacious as monotherapy and in combination with ICI in CTNNB1-mutated HCCs through impacting tumor cell-intrinsic signaling and remodeling global immune surveillance, providing rationale for clinical investigations.",

Here, we find that the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway determines the chemosensitivity. Chemotherapeutic drugs promote the degradation of cytosolic Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II, Aspartate transcarbamylase, and Dihydroorotase (CAD), an enzyme that is rate-limiting for pyrimidine synthesis, leading to apoptosis. We also find that CAD needs to be cleaved by caspase-3 on its Asp1371 residue, before its degradation. Overexpressing CAD or mutating Asp1371 to block caspase-3 cleavage confers chemoresistance in xenograft and Cldn18-ATK gastric cancer models. Importantly, mutations related to Asp1371 of CAD are found in tumor samples that failed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and pharmacological targeting of CAD-Asp1371 mutations using RMY-186 ameliorates chemotherapy efficacy. Our work reveals the vulnerability of de novo pyrimidine synthesis during chemotherapy, highlighting CAD as a promising therapeutic target and biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Eliminating latent HIV-1 is a major goal of AIDS research but host factors determining the size of these reservoirs are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of host gene expression on HIV-1 reservoir size during suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Peripheral blood cells of fourteen males initiating ART during acute infection and demonstrating effective viral suppression but varying magnitudes of total HIV-1 DNA were characterized by single-cell RNA sequencing. Differential expression analysis demonstrates increased CD14+ monocyte activity in participants having undetectable HIV-1 reservoirs, with IL1B expression inversely associating with reservoir size. This is validated in another cohort of 38 males comprised of different ancestry and HIV-1 subtypes, and with intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA®) measurements. Modeling interactions show monocyte IL1B expression associates inversely with reservoir size at higher frequencies of central memory CD4+ T cells, linking monocyte IL1B expression to cell types known to be reservoirs for persistent HIV-1. Functional analyses reveal that IL1B activates NF-κB, thereby promoting productive HIV-1 infection while simultaneously suppressing viral spread, suggesting a natural latency reversing activity to deplete the reservoir in ART-treated individuals. Altogether, scRNA-seq analyses reveal that monocyte IL1B expression could decrease HIV-1 proviral reservoirs in individuals initiating ART during acute infection.",

Here we demonstrate the use of hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻) as an electrolyte additive to overcome this limitation, achieving prolonged operation for over 5,000 hours at 1 A cm−2 and 2300 hours at 2 A cm−2 using NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) as anode. Together with the experimental findings, PF₆⁻ can intercalate into LDH interlayers and adsorb onto the electrode surface under an applied electric field, blocking Cl⁻ and stabilizing Fe to prevent segregation. The constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations further reveal the accumulation of high surface concentrations of PF6\n            − on the electrode surface that can effectively exclude Cl−, mitigating corrosion. Our work showcases synchronous interlayer and surface engineering by single non-oxygen anion species to enable Cl− rejection and marks a crucial step forward in seawater electrolysis.",

We utilise an aerosol human challenge model using attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG, in BCG-naïve UK adults. The primary endpoint of this study (NCT03912207) was to characterise the early immune responses induced by aerosol BCG infection, the secondary endpoint was to identify immune markers associated with in-vitro protection. Blinded volunteers were randomised to inhale 1 × 107 CFU aerosolised BCG or 0.9% saline (20:6); and sequentially allocated to bronchoscopy at day 2 or 7 post-inhalation (10 BCG, 3 saline each timepoint). In the bronchoalveolar lavage post-aerosol BCG infection, there was an increase in frequency of eosinophils, neutrophils, NK cells and Donor-Unrestricted T cells at day 7, and the frequency of antigen presenting cells decreased at day 7 compared with day 2. The frequency of interferon-gamma+ BCG-specific CD4+ T cells increased in the BAL and peaked in the blood at day 7 post-BCG infection compared to day 2. BAL cells at day 2 and day 7 upregulated gene pathways related to phagocytosis, MHC-II antigen loading, T cell activation and proliferation. BCG’s lack of key virulence factors and its failure to induce granulomas, may mean the observed immune responses do not fully recapitulate Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, human infection models can provide unique insights into early immune mechanisms, informing vaccine design for complex pathogens.",

The pilus consists of a flexible tip fibrillum, formed by the adhesin FimH and the subunits FimG and FimF. The pilus rod is a helical assembly of up to 3000 copies of the main subunit FimA, terminated by a single copy of the subunit FimI that anchors the rod to the assembly platform FimD in the outer membrane. Although type 1 pilus assembly can be completely reconstituted in vitro, the precise mechanism of assembly termination on FimD is still unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the fully assembled pilus with all its components prior to and after incorporation of FimI, capped with the assembly chaperone FimC. The structures reveal that FimD positions the proximal end of the pilus rod at an angle of ca. 50 degrees relative to the plane of the outer membrane. Specific interactions between FimI and FimC, absent in the equivalent FimA-FimC interface of the non-terminated pilus, stabilize the assembly-terminated state. In addition, we present structures of the transition region between the tip fibrillum and the helical rod, showing how FimF aligns the tip fibrillum along the rod axis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          A major hurdle to curing HIV is the persistence of integrated proviruses in resting CD4+ T cells that remain in a transcriptionally silent, latent state. One strategy to eradicate latent HIV is to activate viral transcription, followed by elimination of infected cells through virus-mediated cytotoxicity or immune-mediated clearance. We hypothesised that mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology would provide an opportunity to deliver mRNA encoding proteins able to reverse HIV latency in resting CD4+ T cells. Here we develop an LNP formulation (LNP X) with unprecedented potency to deliver mRNA to hard-to-transfect resting CD4+ T cells in the absence of cellular toxicity or activation. Encapsulating an mRNA encoding the HIV Tat protein, an activator of HIV transcription, LNP X enhances HIV transcription in ex vivo CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV. LNP X further enables the delivery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) activation machinery to modulate both viral and host gene transcription. These findings offer potential for the development of a range of nucleic acid-based T cell therapeutics.",

Because structured beams result from carefully engineered interferences, their synthesis requires coherent light and all the sources demonstrated so far rely on coherent lasing cavities—usually pumped with external optical schemes. Here, we introduce non-lasing sources emitting directional vortex beams upon electrical injection. Their architecture consists of colloidal PbS quantum dot LEDs that integrate a photonic environment with two complementary functions: to make the emitters populate radial photonic modes with extended spatial coherence, and to structure the leakage of these modes into free space. Our electrically-pumped sources exhibit phase singularities across the electroluminescence spectrum of the quantum dots, leading to vortex light emission with a bandwidth of 300 nm in the near-infrared.",

    "abstract": "Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) containing UiO‐type metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown excellent potential for CO2 separation processes due to their unique permeability and selectivity properties. However, while the performance of MOF‐based MMMs has been widely studied, the effect of structural defects and polymer‐filler compatibility are not yet fully understood. In this work, the CO2 separation performance of Pebax MH1657‐based MMMs is systematically evaluated incorporating 5–20 wt% of Zr‐based MOF, including UiO‐66, UiO‐67, and two defect‐engineered UiO‐66 analogues, featuring extended linker (UiO‐66_A) or cluster (UiO‐66_F) vacancies. The structural, morphological, and thermal properties of the membranes are thoroughly characterized, with emphasis on correlating these features with gas transport performance. Single‐gas permeation experiments (CO2, CH4, H2) reveal that incorporating UiO nanoparticles within the matrix consistently enhanced CO2 permeability, reaching 145 Barrer for the 20 wt% UiO‐66_F MMM, a 216.4% increase over the neat membrane. CO2/CH4 and CO2/H2 selectivities also improve upon increasing MOF loadings, with UiO‐66_F achieving values of 25 and 18, respectively. This study provides insights for designing high‐performance MMMs for CO2 separation applications, such as biogas upgrading and hydrogen purification.",

    "abstract": "4D printing represents a transformative leap in material science, enabling the fabrication of smart materials that change shape, properties, or functions over time in response to stimuli like heat, light, or magnetic fields. Among these, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) stand out due to their unique combination of liquid crystalline order and polymer elasticity. This fusion enables LCEs to undergo large, reversible shape changes, making them ideal for applications in soft robotics, biomedical devices, sensors, and adaptive optics. This review explores the latest advancements in the 4D printing of LCEs, focusing on cutting‐edge fabrication techniques such as direct ink writing (DIW), VAT photopolymerization, and hybrid approaches. These methods provide precise control over molecular alignment, enabling the creation of programmable structures capable of complex movements. The integration of LCEs with nanoparticles, liquid metals, and shape‐memory polymers has further enhanced their mechanical strength, thermal stability, and multifunctionality. Despite these breakthroughs, challenges remain in achieving scalability, long‐term stability, and cost‐effective production. This review highlights these hurdles and discusses potential solutions while emphasizing the future potential of LCEs in revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, robotics, and environmental monitoring. This article aims to inspire further innovation in 4D‐printed LCE technologies by offering a comprehensive overview.",

While first‐generation ADCs, created by conjugating payloads to surface‐accessible lysine or hinge‐cysteine residues, have achieved clinical success, several site‐specific ADCs with defined drug‐to‐antibody ratios are currently under clinical investigation. Herein, the efficacy, stability, and pharmacokinetics of ADCs generated by attaching the drug linker to surface‐exposed lysine residues, hinge‐cysteine residues, and the C’E loop in the CH2 domain (mediated by bacterial transglutaminase) using a tubulysin payload are compared. In N87 xenograft mice, the order of efficacy is C’E loop > hinge‐cysteine > lysine‐conjugated ADCs. Among the three ADCs evaluated, the site‐specific ADC demonstrates superior in vivo stability (minimal payload‐linker deconjugation and limited payload metabolism/deacetylation) and favorable pharmacokinetics (longer half‐life, low clearance, high exposure). In contrast, the lysine‐conjugated ADC exhibits the least stability and poorest pharmacokinetics, which directly correlate with its efficacy. Further investigation into cysteine‐engineered site‐specific ADCs with payloads conjugated at various sites confirms that both the conjugation chemistry and the site of conjugation significantly influence the in vivo stability and pharmacokinetics of site‐specific ADCs.",

The carboxylic groups of AA provide a pH‐responsive and DOX‐holding ability of the polymer matrix, while sulfur groups of BAC provide a covalent immobilization of the AA‐BAC microgel onto the gold electrode surface. The microgel is responsive to electrochemically generated pH decrease due to ascorbate oxidation. As a result of the local pH drop on the electrode interface electrostatic attraction between the carrier and the positively charged DOX diminishes, which together with the shrinkage of the matrix results in the controlled release of DOX from the microgel. The electrodes modified by microgel based on N,N′‐methylene‐bis‐acrylamide (BIS) as a crosslinker are used as a control. However, AA‐BIS microgel does not contain sulfur groups and it can only be not explicitly adsorbed on the gold electrode while the efficacy of this modification is significantly worse compared to covalent immobilization of AA‐BAC via sulfur groups of BAC. Thus, electrode surface area covered by adsorbed (AA‐BIS)‐DOX microgel is approximately estimated as 34% compared to 90% for covalently immobilized (AA‐BAC)‐DOX microgel.",

    "abstract": "Electrodeposition of lithium (Li) metal is a crucial process for high‐energy‐density rechargeable Li batteries. The morphology of Li deposits during electrodeposition governs the reversibility of the deposition/dissolution reaction, thereby significantly affecting the performance and safety of Li metal batteries. Various morphologies, including hemispherical, granular, columnar and whisker‐like structures have been realized by modulating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the deposition process. However, the intrinsic Li deposition structure matching the body‐centered cubic (BCC) structure remains unexplored. In this work, we first successfully achieved precise control over cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating the anodic interface and optimizing the deposition pressure, while demonstrated kinetic‐driven morphology evolution and substrate‐engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. These findings integrate the thermodynamic theory of crystal growth with interface engineering, not only completing the missing piece in the cubic Wulff construction of Li metal but also providing a new paradigm for controlling the morphology of metal electrodes.",

Herein, a stepwise scheme for carbon‐to‐oxygen swap in tetralins leading to privileged chroman scaffolds is presented. Increasing the oxidation state at each stage, the substrate scope naturally extends: starting from tetralins via 1‐tetralones and further via seven‐membered lactones, the transformation results in diverse chroman‐2‐carboxylic acids and chroman‐2‐ols. The efficiency of this synthetic route is governed by the developed new oxidative ring‐contractive transformations of tetrahydrobenzooxepinones, enabled by intermediate silylation into ketene acetals. The described carbon‐to‐oxygen swap is illustrated by 40+ examples, including skeletal editing of natural products and short formal synthesis of Heliannuol E. Formation of chroman‐2‐ols tentatively may proceed via original mechanism with extrusion of carbon monoxide.",

In this work, H2 and N2 activation mediated by a diuranium complex was studied from a nonadiabatic perspective using multi–configurational ab initio calculations combined with density functional theory. Stepwise electron transfer during the reaction enhances degeneracy between electronic states, enabling state‐to‐state transitions, i.e., spin downshift. The dual functionality of transition states acting as thermodynamic gateways and channels for nonadiabatic transitions was disclosed. The π and σ cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation. Bonding analysis reveals that U5f/6d orbitals mixing with H1s/N2p orbitals afford some degree of covalency to the primarily ionic U─H/N interactions, with the 6d‐orbitals contributing more pronounced than the 5f‐orbitals in σ interactions, while the U─N π bonding exhibits significant U5f contributions.",

These compounds comprise PROTACs, molecular glue degraders and DUB inhibitors, among others. However, methods for the proteome‐wide monitoring of compound‐induced changes in protein polyubiquitination, which may also detect non‐degradative modifications, are lacking. Here, we report the utilization of polyubiquitin enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry to monitor small molecule‐induced changes in cellular protein ubiquitination. We established enrichment through tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs) following semi‐denaturing cell lysis and devised an elution protocol compatible with downstream LC‐MS/MS analysis. We demonstrate broad applicability of the workflow by assessing ubiquitination changes induced by a PROTAC, a p97 inhibitor and deubiquitinase inhibitors. Application of the assay to compounds inhibiting the deubiquitinase USP7 revealed the induction of non‐degradative ubiquitination on the UBE3A E3 ligase. Collectively, we established a versatile proteomics method to facilitate the direct investigation of cellular polyubiquitination, with high relevance for the identification and characterization of protein degraders, stabilizers and other molecules with ubiquitin‐mediated bioactivity.",

Here, we present a groundbreaking palladium‐catalyzed system for P(III)‐directed C─H activation of aminophosphines, followed by annulation with alkynes. By utilizing P‐stereogenic aminophosphines, we have achieved the stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles. This innovative process, facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, efficiently yields a wide range of P‐heterocycles. The pivotal breakthrough of our methodology lies in the identification of phosphonium salts as effective additives, which undertake multiple functions: they not only reduce the energy barrier of pivotal steps but also regenerate the palladium catalyst while safeguarding the P(III) directing group from oxidation. Through systematic experimental investigations, particularly by comparing transition states with and without quaternary phosphonium salts, we have elucidated the unique reaction pathway, thereby explaining the critical role of the salts.",

Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen‐doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20 mV at 10 mA cm⁻2 in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N‐doping of Ru clusters self‐optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self‐powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn–H₂O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demonstrating its practicability.",

    "abstract": "The production of COx‐free hydrogen via the ammonia decomposition reaction (ADR) using Fe‐based non‐precious metal catalysts has attracted much attention. N‐H bond cleavage and N‐N coupling are two key steps in NH3 decomposition, however, stronger Fe‐N binding leads to iron catalysts typically exhibit lower activity. Herein, we develop FeCu alloy catalysts with optimized metal‐nitrogen binding energy by incorporating Cu, a metal with inherently weaker nitrogen affinity, into Fe‐based catalysts. The optimized Fe1Cu0.5/MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 139.1 mmol H2 gcat−1 h−1 at 550 °C under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV = 360,000 h−1). Mechanistic studies reveal that the modulation of the d‐band structure due to the alloying effect optimizes the dissociation of NH3 and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ADR process. Notably, in‐situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with theoretical calculations confirm that FeCu alloying effectively reduces the N‐N recombination energy barrier from 2.25 eV (Fe cluster) to 1.77 eV (FeCu cluster). These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly active Fe‐based catalysts for efficient ammonia decomposition and sustainable hydrogen production.",

Traditionally, these reagents feature α‐tertiary substitution and are used in aprotic solvents, typically yielding homoallylic alcohols with disubstituted (Z)‐vinylsilanes. Here, we report the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched quaternary α‐silyl crotylboronates via stereospecific allylic Matteson homologation. We further demonstrate that hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)—a polar alcoholic solvent that has been underutilized in allylboration—not only enhances reaction reactivity but also overrides the typical (Z)‐selectivity, enabling access to the otherwise challenging (E)‐selective products. The method enables the rapid construction of (E)‐anti‐2,4‐dimethylpent‐3‐en‐1‐oxy motif, a structural unit frequently found in polyketides, and allows the protecting‐group‐free synthesis of PM050463. DFT calculations suggest that HFIP's strong hydrogen bonding effect increases the Lewis acidity of the boron center and the steric effect of Bpin, resulting in high yields and (E)‐selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractApproximately 40% of marketed drugs exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles. Co‐crystallization, where pairs of molecules form a multicomponent crystal, constitutes a promising strategy to enhance physicochemical properties without compromising the pharmacological activity. However, finding promising co‐crystal pairs is resource‐intensive due to the large and diverse range of possible molecular combinations. We present DeepCocrystal, a novel deep learning approach designed to predict co‐crystal formation by processing the “chemical language” from a supramolecular vantage point. Rigorous validation of DeepCocrystal showed a balanced accuracy of 78% in realistic scenarios, outperforming existing models. Explainable AI approaches uncovered the decision‐making process of DeepCocrystal, showing its capability to learn chemically relevant aspects of the “supramolecular language” that match experimental co‐crystallization patterns. By leveraging properties of molecular string representations, DeepCocrystal can also estimate the uncertainty of its predictions. We harnessed this capability in a challenging prospective study and successfully discovered two novel co‐crystals of diflunisal, an anti‐inflammatory drug. This study underscores the potential of deep learning—and in particular of chemical language processing—to accelerate co‐crystallization and ultimately drug development, in both academic and industrial contexts.

    "abstract": "The operational stability of n‐i‐p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under heat, air and humidity have notably improved over recent years. Yet, performance degradation under light and voltage bias remains a concern for their commercial deployment. One of the main causes of such degradation relates to mobile ions in the perovskite film, which can trigger ion migration and self‐accelerating chemical degradation. Here, we propose an energetics modulation strategy by developing the electron‐withdrawing Pyridinecarboxaldehyde oxime (PO) ligand for FAPbI3‐based perovskites. The introduction of PO ligands increases the ionization potential of the perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions during the crystallization process and subsequent device operation. Furthermore, this additive promotes the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts, which can help to regulate the energy level of perovskite and facilitate charge transport to the contact stacks. As a result, the optimized n‐i‐p PSCs exhibit a high efficiency of 26.13% and maintain over 88% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 h maximum power point (MPP) tracking test under one sun illumination. This work underlines the importance of energetics modulation for inhibiting intrinsic perovskite degradation that cannot be achieved by mere device encapsulation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDecoupling the trade‐off between second‐harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (Δn) while maintaining a wide bandgap (Eg) is a critical challenge in the field of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In this work, we introduce a novel “triple‐control coordination engineering” strategy that successfully addresses this challenge. By integrating dihedral angle modulation, coordination mode switching, and polarizability engineering, we have synthesized three zinc halides—[(C5H6N2O2)(C5H5N2O2)ZnCl (I), (C5H6N2O2)ZnCl2(II), and (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 (III)]—that exhibit exceptional UV NLO performance. Through dynamic C─C─N bond rotation, we achieved precise control over the dihedral angle (81°→84°), effectively modulating optical anisotropy (Δn = 0.048–0.071@1064 nm). pH/temperature‐driven coordination mode evolution enabled complete alignment of the [ZnO2X2] polyhedron, while halogen substitution (Cl → Br) amplified polarizability gradients. These advancements resulted in a stepwise amplified SHG response (0.4→3.5→8.2 × KH2PO4, abbreviated as KDP), controlled Δn, wide Eg (>5.0 eV), and remarkable thermal stability (>250 °C). Notably, (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 stands out as the first zinc‐based halide to simultaneously achieve large SHG (>8 × KDP), moderate birefringence (0.05Δn Eg > 5.0 eV). This work not only provides a paradigm‐shifting approach to materials design but also paves the way for the development of UV NLO materials with superior comprehensive performance.",

Structural characterization, transient absorption, temperature‐dependent dynamics combined with theoretical calculations were investigated to elucidate the narrowband mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the high symmetry and substantial conjugation of the graphitic core enhance material rigidity with minimal exciton‐capturing defects. The high pyrrole N content increases conjugated electron delocalization, promoting radiative recombination of confined electrons and holes, thereby reducing FWHM. The large exciton binding energy, weak electron‐phonon coupling and simple radiative dynamics of the CDs further contribute to their ultra‐narrow emission bandwidths. The CDs exhibit exceptional photo and thermal stabilities in extremely acidic or alkaline conditions and various organic solvents. No quenching or peak broadening is observed at high CD concentrations, rendering these materials suitable for applications in high‐performance optoelectronic devices. Excitingly, CD‐based light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000 mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150 h at 300 mA.

To overcome these challenges, herein, we report highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral indole‐fused medium‐ and large‐sized rings via organocatalytic asymmetric (4 + 4) and (4 + 4 + m) cycloadditions of 2‐indolylacetates with benzofuranyl azadienes, providing an efficient strategy for accessing these enantioenriched frameworks. By designing 2‐indolylacetates as a new class of four‐carbon platform molecules for higher‐order cycloadditions and modulating the nucleophilicity of benzofuranyl azadienes, we achieved the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral indole‐fused eight‐membered rings and eleven‐ to fourteen‐membered macrocycles in high yields with good enantioselectivity. This work not only demonstrates the first application of 2‐indolylacetates as four‐carbon platform molecules in cycloaddition reactions, but also represents the first catalytic asymmetric (4 + 4) and (4 + 4 + m) cycloadditions of 2‐indolylacetates.

    "abstract": "AbstractHere, we show that the four conformers of the regularly used ionic liquid anion bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide  are true enantiomeric pairs by analyzing their calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra. The significant modes involve those atoms of the anion that form specific hydrogen bond patterns with the chiral probe molecule propylene oxide. Adding this probe molecule to the ionic liquid 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the experimental and simulated spectra indicate intermolecular interaction between the chiral molecule and the liquid and thus the induction of chirality in the anion. This emergence of chirality in the ionic liquid takes place via the hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and the solute, which results in a redistribution of the symmetric occurrence of conformers to an asymmetric one. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanism of chiral induction from the propylene oxide molecule to the ionic liquid anion, while pointing out the importance of rational over a random choice of the ionic liquid building units.",

    "abstract": "AbstractControllable fabrication of single‐crystal metal oxide is of paramount importance for advanced photo(electro)catalytic applications, but achieving nonequilibrium crystal shapes with tailored facets through molten salt synthesis still remains a challenge. Herein, we systematically explored the effect of Al3+ concentration in tailoring crystal facets of SrTiO3 single crystals and developed a one‐step molten salt strategy for engineering anisotropic structures by using miscible AlCl3 as Al3+ additive. By progressively increasing Al3+ concentration, a series of high‐quality SrTiO3 single crystals exposing {100}, {111}, and {110} facets were sequentially synthesized. Theoretical calculations reveal an Al‐doping stabilized {111} surface reconstruction and provide further atomistic insights into the surface structural evolution with Wulff constructions as Al3+ concentration increases. Experimental results demonstrate that the anisotropic facets dominate the efficient charge separation for the enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting activity. Consequently, SrTiO3 single crystals enclosed by well‐defined {100} and {111} facets exhibit a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 2621.85 µmol·h−1 and an apparent quantum yield value of 50.5% at 350 nm for stoichiometric overall water splitting. This work offers a molten‐salt synthetic strategy and valuable insight for preparing facet‐controlled single‐crystal semiconductors.",

However, the suboptimal ionic conductive properties exhibited by the electrolyte, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites due to the deposition of inhomogeneous Li+ and the potential safety hazards caused by unstable interfaces have seriously affected the cycle life of the battery at extreme temperatures. Herein, a fluoropolymer‐containing plastic‐crystal‐based electrolyte (FPCE) has been developed by means of a structural engineering process, with the objective of optimizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The integration of solvent structure simulation and experimental results demonstrates that FPCE regulates Li+ transport, promotes the in‐situ formation of the LiF‐rich inorganic–organic hybrid SEI, and enhances the overall stability of the battery. Consequently, FPCE assists in preserving stable LFP|FPCE|Li cells cycling, with 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 C and an average capacity decay rate of merely 0.00448% per cycle. Furthermore, the Ah‐level pouch cells demonstrate the capacity to operate stably within the temperature range of −10 to 80 °C. This study provides a valuable strategy for the design of wide‐temperature solid‐state polymer electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrolytes play a crucial role in regulating interfacial chemistry, which is essential for the development of high‐energy‐density lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present an ether‐based electrolyte system incorporating the simplest Grignard reagent, CH3MgCl, as an additive. This additive, endowed with Lewis‐base characteristics, enhances the stability of the anode‐electrolyte interface through bifunctional effects. During Li deposition, CH3Mg+ preferentially adsorbs onto the electrode surface, attracting more anions into the Helmholtz layer. Concurrently, CH3− creates an electron‐rich environment, facilitating nucleophilic attacks on anions and promoting its reduction to form an inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI). Additionally, Mg2+ undergoes electrodeposition prior to Li+, forming a Li‐Mg alloy with subsequently deposited Li. This process lowers the nucleation barrier for Li deposition, resulting in improved deposition uniformity. Accordingly, the designed electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability for Li anodes in both Li||Cu half‐cells and full‐cells paired with LiFePO4 cathodes. Notably, Li||LiFePO4 batteries using a thin‐film Li anode pre‐deposited on Cu retain ∼92.84% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of ∼99.74%. These findings highlight the critical role of additives in engineering interfacial chemistry and provide a promising strategy for designing advanced electrolytes to improve the cycling performance of Li metal batteries.",

The synthesized MOFs exhibited excellent light absorption properties and chemical stability across various solvents. Its insoluble and stable framework, combined with an optimal band gap, enabled its use as a photocatalyst for organic transformations. For the first time, Ce‐Naph MOF is explored as a heterogeneous catalyst for photocatalytic applications specifically for the selective C–H amination of alkanes, achieving yields of up to 89% under ambient conditions. We propose that the initial metal‐to‐ligand charge transfer in Ce‐Naph MOF, promoted by light, is essential for forming an active alkoxy‐Ce(IV)‐species. This species subsequently undergoes ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer to generate the alkoxy radical, which acts as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent to activate alkanes. Furthermore, Ce‐Naph MOF demonstrated long‐term cyclic stability, maintaining its catalytic activity and structural integrity over five cycles, highlighting its durability as a heterogeneous catalyst. We are confident that this straightforward and practical methodology opens new avenues for industrial applications, significantly advancing the fields of metal catalysis, photocatalysis, and sustainable chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe vortex features a helical structure and exhibits macroscopic chirality. Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal‐organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex‐responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptically silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent‐colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex‐induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolvated electrons, one of the strongest reducing agents, exhibit short lifetimes in the range of pico‐ to milliseconds when generated photochemically or by radiolysis in solution. In contrast, solvated electrons produced using sodium metal in liquid ammonia are stable for days and have long been used in synthetic chemistry. Using sodium atoms as an electron source, we were able to trap solvated electrons in low‐density amorphous (LDA) water ice matrices with lifetimes of several days and use these electrons as reducing reagents. In LDA matrices doped with benzonitrile 1, these electrons react with 1 to form the benzonitrile radical anion 2. In argon matrices, in the absence of water, only small amounts of 2 were observed after deposition, and most of the sodium and 1 remained unreacted. The yield of radical anion 2 is significantly higher in amorphous water ice than in solid argon. The photoexcitation of radical anion 2 in both argon and LDA water ice matrices resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer under back formation of benzonitrile 1. Annealing of argon matrices doped with small amounts of water containing 2 resulted in the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 hydrogen‐bonded complexes between water and radical anion 2.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe extension of previous studies of heterometallic rings (HMRs) is described, including new synthetic chemistry and physics. These HMRs feature a ring of, typically, eight metal centers with a central charge‐balancing cation. New HMRs and related molecules are described, varying the number of metals present. The eight metal HMRs have been used as components of larger supramolecular assembly, most often by making the HMRs into [2]rotaxanes or pseudo‐rotaxanes, where the thread of the rotaxane is terminated by a binding group such as pyridine. This allows the formation of [n]rotaxanes, where n = 3, 4, 5,7, 13, or 1014. Mass spectrometry and NMR studies of the HMRs have given greater understanding of the host‐guest chemistry of these metal analogues of crown ethers. Physical studies have included 4D‐inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and continuous wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure magnetic interactions between spin components of the supramolecular assemblies. The use of the HMRs as resists for high‐resolution lithography is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFerredoxins deliver electrons to drive many challenging biochemical transformations, including enzyme‐catalyzed nitrogen fixation. We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase‐mediated nitrogen fixation in R. capsulatus. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure, and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into ∆fdxC and ∆fdxN R. capsulatus‐deletion strains under N2‐fixing conditions, showed that plasmid‐based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe‐nitrogenase activity in both ∆fdxC and ∆fdxN strains, while plasmid‐based fdxC expression could only complement the ∆fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen‐bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]‐cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, while providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2‐fixation.",

Herein, we report a multifunctional composite material that embeds β‐ketoenamine‐linked nano TPTTA covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator (rhodium complex, [Cp*Rh(bpy) (H2O)Cl2] into a functional mesoporous silica matrix for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This strategy enables the facilitation of the electron transfer process while maintaining the intrinsic properties of the COFs, providing flexibility in COFs design. The strategic integration of electron mediator and the shortened charge migration path due to the nanosized COFs results in an NADH regeneration yield of 75.7% and a selectivity of 89.8% for 1,4‐NADH. The initial reaction rate for NADH regeneration attained 8.7 gNADH•gCat−1•h−1, and the system showed no decrease in activity after four reaction cycles.",

To facilitate the future development of non‐ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G‐protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein–lipid binding, top‐down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non‐canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the future.",

Herein, we present an electrocatalyst that RuS2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto MoO3/MoS2 nanosheets support to obtain abundant heterojunction interfaces of RuS2‐MoO3/MoS2 for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction. It enhanced the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation and optimizing the reaction kinetics. RuS2‐MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for alkaline HER, showing a low overpotential of only 51 mV at current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−1, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most previously reported alkaline HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it also has outstanding long‐term stability, capable of maintaining current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 for durations exceeding 500 hours and 100 hours under the chronoamperometric method, respectively. This research offers novel insights and clear guidance for the development of high‐performance, cost‐effective RuS2 electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmination of 1‐amino‐4‐bromoanthraquinone‐2‐sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone‐type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a innovative strategy for the in situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5‐diamino‐2,4,6‐trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post‐treatment. Characterization techniques, including X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the solution- and solid-state assembly of phenylalanine-based hypervalent iodine macrocycles (HIMs) with lithium and sodium cations. The metal cation binding of HIMs was evaluated by addition of lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ethyl etherate LiBArF20 and sodium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate NaBArF24. The electron-rich, outwardly projected carbonyl oxygens of the HIM co-crystalize with the cations into bent supramolecular architectures. Both crystal structures show a pattern of assembly between HIM and metal cation in 2:1 ratio. While association with sodium leads to a polymer-like network, the lithium crystal structure was limited to dimeric assemblies of HIM. In the lithium-coordinating complex, the oxygen–lithium–oxygen bond angle is approximately 98.83°, displaying a closer arrangement of two HIMs. In contrast, the sodium complex exhibits a more open orientation of two HIMs with an oxygen–sodium–oxygen bond angle close to 167.98°. Lastly, a comparative study of association constants and binding energies for phenylalanine-based HIM with LiBArF20 and NaBArF24 are presented.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntegrating renewable electricity and concentrated CO2 from direct air capture, electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) offer a promising pathway for converting CO2 into fuel chemicals, enabling the closure of the carbon loop in a sustainable manner. The clean H2 produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water electrolysis can replace traditional fossil fuels without additional CO2 emissions. Achieving large‐scale and high‐efficiency eCO2RR and HER requires the development of rational electrolyzer designs, which are crucial for industrial implementation. This review examines recent innovations in system designs for eCO2RR, HER, and the latest advances in in situ cell designs for operando characterization during electrochemical reactions. It focuses on cell improvements in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, and electrolyte engineering to maximize catalytic activities at the industrial level. Besides, the review discusses optimizing counter‐anodic reactions to improve the energy efficiency of eCO2RR and water electrolysis, offering insights into the design of catalytic systems with efficient energy utilization. Furthermore, it explores the integration of eCO2RR and HER with other electrochemical systems (e.g., fuel cells), highlighting their potential role in the decarbonization of future industrial processes. Finally, the summary, challenge, and outlook on the industrial‐scale eCO2RR and water electrolysis system designs are concluded.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExtracellular matrix (ECM), a core member of tumor microenvironment, is ≈1.5‐fold harder than the surrounding normal tissues. Regulating the stiffness of ECM can significantly impact physiological activities of tumor cells, such as growth, differentiation, and migration. Herein, a sonopiezoelectric‐response nanoplatform consisting of Cu3BiS3 nanospheres (CBS NSs) is constructed for ECM remodeling. Sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are conducted using ultrasound (US) and near‐infrared irradiation. Under US irradiation, the mechanical strain of CBS NSs causes piezoelectric polarization and promotes a redox reaction through energy band bending. The built‐in electric field generated by US irradiation amplifies the efficiency of the Fenton‐like reaction and substantially enhances reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, piezoelectric property‐mediated electrical signals can allow Ca2+ influx, upregulating the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐2 and MMP‐9. Integrating US irradiation with near‐infrared irradiation generates localized heat, which can effectively denature tumor collagen, reduce tumor stiffness, and enhance the permeability of CBS NSs into solid tumors, thus improving the SPT effect. The combination of MMP upregulation and collagen degradation can maximize the benefits of ECM remodeling and synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic efficacy of SPT/CDT. This SPT/CDT synergistic therapy and ECM remodeling platform is an innovative strategy for cancer therapy.",

However, current oral probiotic therapies neglect the crucial role of probiotic‐driven SCFAs metabolism in restoring gut‐bone homeostasis. In this study, commencing with the sequencing of fecal samples from clinical patients with PMO, a self‐replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via a thiol–ene click reaction to restore gut‐bone homeostasis using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid (HA) as a self‐replenishable prebiotic substrate. In vitro, the SMASMs exhibit favorable biocompatibility, enhanced resistance to gastric acid, and improved mucosal adhesion for colonization. In vivo, oral administration of SMASMs in ovariectomized mice improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions. Notably, HA serves as a sustainable prebiotic substrate that supports the LGG metabolic niche and microbial homeostasis, enhances the production of SCFAs, including butyric, isobutyric, and valeric acids, and contributes to the downregulation of key osteoclastic signaling factors. Importantly, this strategy of oral SMASMs through in situ fermentation offers novel insights into addressing metabolic disorders associated with gut microbiota via the gut–X axis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReplacing the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with the thermodynamically favorable methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising strategy for energy‐efficient hydrogen production. However, optimizing electrocatalytic performance in the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and MOR requires precise regulation of the electrochemical coordination environment and a fundamental understanding of activity origins, posing a significant challenge. Here, a scalable strategy is developed that harnesses the high electronegativity of fluorine (F) to tailor the coordination environment of Ni3N, enhancing HER kinetics. Concurrently, adsorbed F ions induce rapid and extensive self‐reconstruction of the Ni3N surface during MOR by dynamically modulating interfacial ion concentrations (OH⁻ and Ni species). This reconstruction enhances catalytic activity and enables the selective oxidation of methanol to formate via a sequential pathway, involving primary O‐H bond activation followed by subsequent C‐H bond cleavage at Ni active sites. Consequently, F10‐Ni3N demonstrates exceptional bifunctional performance, delivering 2.02 V and remarkable stability (600 h) for MOR‐coupled hydrogen production in a membrane electrode assembly‐based flow electrolyzer at an industrially relevant current density of 200 mA cm−2. This work establishes a dual‐regulation paradigm for electrocatalysts, offering mechanistic insights into surface reconstruction and a rational design framework for next‐generation energy conversion systems.",

Herein, it is demonstrated that substrate‐regulated interfacial nucleation governs crystal growth orientation and film quality of tin perovskites. The results show that pristine PEDOT:PSS substrates induce bottom‐interface‐dominated nucleation via strong PEDOT+‐[SnI3]nn− interactions, driving rapid upward crystallization of tin perovskites and yielding rough films with low photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE: ≈26%). Strategic substrate modification with potassium citrate (PC) weakens the PEDOT+‐[SnI3]nn− interactions, thereby redirecting nucleation initiation to the top interface during solvent evaporation. This results in controlled downward crystallization of tin perovskites, forming smooth films with improved crystallinity and superior optoelectronic properties (PLQE: ≈41%). The optimized tin perovskite light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve record‐breaking performance with an external quantum efficiency of 12.8% and a maximum radiance of 190 W sr−1 m−2, which is the highest performance reported for tin perovskite near‐infrared LEDs to date.

Herein, this challenge is addressed through sulfur‐induced electronic modulation of Ag‐based catalysts, steering the CO2 reduction pathway toward ethanol production. By constructing atomically engineered Ag/Ag2S nanowires (NWs) via a controlled sulfurization strategy, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% for ethanol at −0.95 V, along with exceptional stability over 14 h of high‐performance metrics surpassing most reported Ag‐based systems is achieved. Operando electrochemical surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC‐SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the Ag/Ag2S heterointerface synergistically regulates interfacial water networks and stabilizes key *CO intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation, proton‐coupled electron transfer, and asymmetric C‐C coupling. Furthermore, sulfurization‐induced dual effects‐optimized hydrogen‐bond interactions and enriched K⁺ confinement are identified as critical drivers for tailoring the local microenvironment to favor ethanol selectivity. This work not only demonstrates a rational atomic interface design for C2 product orientation but also deciphers the dynamic interplay between catalyst electronic structure and interfacial species, offering a molecular‐level roadmap for advanced CO2 conversion systems.",

Perovskite‐gated phototransistors (PGPTs) are introduced that decouple photoresponse and charge transport by using wide‐bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dielectric layers and non‐wide‐bandgap semiconductors as channels. This design offers material flexibility, simplified processing, and enhanced performance. Using the 2D Ruddlesden‐Popper perovskite PEA2PbBr4 (Eg = 3.0 eV) as the dielectric layer and the organic semiconductor (OSC) P3HT as the channel layer, UV phototransistors are successfully achieved with exceptional photodetection performance at operating voltages below 2 V, exhibiting a responsivity of 1960 mA W−1, a specific detectivity of 3  ×  1011 Jones, and a response time of ≈20 ms. Fabricated via low‐temperature (≤100 °C) solution processing, this approach facilitates scalable production and is adaptable to various OSCs and other wide‐bandgap MHP dielectrics, such as PEA2PbCl4 (Eg = 3.6 eV) and PEA2SnI4 (Eg = 3.8 eV), extending their potential for DUV detection. As a proof‐of‐concept, an optical decoder for telecommunications is demonstrated using DUV PEA2PbCl4/PDVT‐10 PGPTs, which are immune to ambient light interference. Additionally, these DUV phototransistors show potential for latent fingerprint detection due to their sensitivity to skin absorption characteristics.",

Recent reports have shown it is also possible to obtain Na‐rich disordered rocksalts, however, it is currently poorly understood how the knowledge of the structural and redox chemistry translates from the Li‐rich to the Na‐rich analogs. Here, the properties of Li2MnO2F and Na2MnO2F are compared, which have different ion sizes (Li+ = 0.76 vs Na+ = 1.02 Å) but the same disordered rocksalt structure and stoichiometry. It is found that Na2MnO2F exhibits lower voltage Mn‐ and O‐redox couples, opening access to a wider compositional range within the same voltage limits. Furthermore, the intercalation mechanism switches from predominantly single‐phase solid solution behavior in Li2MnO2F to a two‐phase transition in Na2MnO2F, accompanied by a greater decrease in the average Mn─O/F bond length. Li2MnO2F retains its long‐range disordered rocksalt structure throughout the first cycle. In contrast, Na2MnO2F becomes completely amorphous during charge and develops a local structure characteristic of a post‐spinel. This amorphization is partially reversible on discharge. The results show how the ion intercalation behavior of disordered rocksalts differs dramatically when changing from Li‐ to Na‐ions and offers routes to control the electrochemical properties of these high‐energy‐density cathodes.",

The recent AWH materials focus primarily on maximizing water uptake, while conventional approaches prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanical integrity, which severely limits their applicability in real‐world scenarios. In this study, a novel tunable hygroscopic mix‐charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel (THMPH) is reported that achieves dual excellence in outstanding moisture absorbency and mechanical robustness. Owing to the broad ionic crosslink's degree enabling the rigid skeletal framework and energy‐dissipative sacrificial networks, THMPH exhibits more than 200 times higher mechanical ductility (225 kPa tensile strength retention at 200% mass swelling ratio) in comparison with the commonly‐used AWH zwitterionic polybetaine. The optimized topological structure coupled with improved lithium chloride binding affinity results in excellent water uptake (2.9 g g−1 at 25 °C, 70% RH). When THMPH is used for daytime photovoltaic panel cooling, it can provide a 15 °C temperature reduction of a PV panel under 1 kW m−2 solar irradiation, resulting in a 7.33% increase in solar energy conversion efficiency. This hydrogel design paradigm, synergizing superior hygroscopicity with exceptional mechanical robustness, demonstrates significant potential for advancing practical applications.",

The production of deep‐UV lasers through the mesoscopic domain structure of ferroelectric materials has been a popular research area via quasi‐phase‐matching (QPM). However, as of right present, no ferroelectric in the deep‐UV area is able to provide QPM laser output. Here, a new room‐temperature borate ferroelectric Ba3Mg3(BO3)3F3 (BMBF) is presented. The ferroelectricity of BMBF crystals exhibits significant relaxor behavior and the random domain structure can relax the strict phase‐matching conditions, rendering it a disordered NLO medium. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, BMBF crystal achieves a second‐harmonic generation output energy of 3.55 µJ for 398 to 199 nm wavelength frequency conversion, even in the absence of birefringent phase‐matching conditions. This result demonstrates that BMBF is a promising candidate for deep‐UV QPM applications. Furthermore, this study expands the frontiers of borate ferroelectrics while the realization of deep‐UV light output using BMBF crystal motivates and provides a path for its broader application.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLi‐rich Mn‐based oxide (LRMO) are promising cathode candidates for next‐generation Li‐ion batteries with combined cost‐effectiveness and high specific capacity. Designing Co‐free LRMO can further leverage the low cost of this class of cathodes given the capacity can be maintained. However, implementing cobalt‐free LRMO cathode materials are hampered by their sluggish kinetics, resulting in low capacity and poor rate performance that underperform compared with their Co‐containing counterparts. Here, it is confirmed that the slow kinetics of Co‐free LRMO originates from the structural disorder caused by transition metals (TMs) migration at high voltages (above 4.5 V Vs. Li+/Li) and consequent irreversible oxygen redox process. Aware of this, Na+/F− is introduced in surficial lattice to alleviate these issues, ultimately achieving improved discharge voltage (≈0.2 V above 1 C, 1 C = 0.25 A g−1), exceptional cycle stability in pouch‐type cell (95.1% capacity retention in 1 C after 400 cycles at 25 °C, and 80.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles in 0.5 C at 45 °C) and excellent C‐rate performance (≈150 mA h g−1 at 5 C). The newly developed Na+/F− gradient design unleashes the surficial charge transfer kinetics limitation and greatly improves the lattice structure stability, consequently providing valuable guidelines for future high‐capacity LRMO cathode design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for neuroblastoma treatment, leveraging ultrasound to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, a major challenge in SDT is the efficiency of ROS generation, particularly in the context of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, inspired by the natural peroxidase, an imide‐linked metal‐phthalocyanine‐based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) has been designed with a well‐defined π‐conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase‐mimetic atomic Fe‐N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. This work demonstrates that COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (•OH and •O2−) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity. Notably, the highly π‐conjugated structure endows COPTPcFe with excellent electron transport capabilities, enabling rapid catalysis of H2O2 to O2, thus alleviating the hypoxic conditions within tumors. Moreover, by encapsulating COPTPcFe with neuroblastoma cell membranes, this study achieveshomologous targeting of tumor cells and tissues, leading to efficient accumulation within tumor cells, mitochondrial disruption, and apoptosis. Additionally, the proposed sonochemodynamic immunotherapy effectively activates natural killer cells and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby alleviating hypoxia and significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of neuroblastoma treatment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGreen solvent fabrication of efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) is essential for their industrial scale extension and ecological sustainability, but there is typically an obvious efficiency drop during the transition from halogenated to green solvents due to the severe molecular aggregation. Here, an innovative strategy of active layer pre‐solidification by liquid nitrogen freezing process is proposed to accelerate molecular precipitation and crystallization, and therefore suppress the excessive phase separation, as demonstrated by PiFM and GISAXs results. Moreover, pre‐solidification process allows more solvents to carry acceptor molecules for an orderly upward migration during rapid volatilization, facilitating an ideal longitudinal gradient arrangement of photovoltaic materials that is favorable for charge transport and extraction. Consequently, PM6:L8BO‐X:BO‐8F OSCs fabricate with o‐xylene yielded a record efficiency of 20.38%, which is comparable to 20.56% for chloroform‐processed devices. The inconspicuous efficiency gaps are observed in various photovoltaic materials by using green solvents, proving the outstanding universality. In addition, the pre‐solidification process effectively inhibits the coffee‐ring effect in large‐area active layer films and boosts the OSC modules to an exciting 17.06% efficiency. This work virtually eliminates the photovoltaic performance losses caused by green solvents, and charts a sustainable avenue to large‐scale commercialization of organic photovoltaics.",

However, solution‐processable deep‐blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR‐TADF) emitter, tBO‐4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12‐di‐tert‐butyl‐5,9‐dioxa‐13b‐boranaphtho[3,2,1‐de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor–donor–acceptor‐type molecular structure. tBO‐4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12 nm but also has a negligibly small singlet‐triplet energy gap and large spin‒orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 × 106 s−1). The sensitizer‐free solution‐processed OLED exploiting tBO‐4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard.

SDBA effectively passivates oxygen vacancies in sputtered TiO2, while simultaneously promoting SnO2 nucleation and improving film quality. Moreover, its molecular structure increases the surface free energy of the ETL, facilitating the formation of high‐quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer defects. As a result, PSCs with this optimized ETL achieve a PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability.

    "abstract": "AbstractMixed‐halide perovskite light‐emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face the critical challenge of field‐dependent phase separation. Discrete colloidal CsPbX3 nanocrystals anchored with ligands are promising to suppress phase separation, yet it remains a mystery how ion migration proceeds when integrated into LEDs as emissive films. Specifically, the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across the nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs needs to be decoupled. Here, a low‐temperature‐assisted transfer‐printing method is developed to construct a model PeLED containing a clear CsPbBr3‐CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface for tracing the ion migration between perovskite nanocrystal films along the direction of electric fields. The comprehensive study demonstrates that halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface lead to severe phase separation and poor device stability, rather than the horizontal intra‐layer diffusion. The monolayer CsPbX3 nanocrystal film prevents the field‐dependent phase separation caused by interlayer ion migration, significantly improving electroluminescent stability, including spectrum and lifetime. The optimized structure achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9% and a remarkably improved operational half‐lifetime of 61.2 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2 in pure‐red PeLEDs based on mixed‐halide CsPb(Ix/Br1‐x)3, more than 300 times longer than the control device using multilayer nanocrystals.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMemristor is believed as an ideal solution for high‐density storage and neuromorphic computing, which can simultaneouly integrate volatile with nonvolatile functionalities. Seeking excellent resistive‐switching materials and probing their underlying physical mechanism remain great challenges until now. Among most candidates, Kondo insulator SmB6 nanobelt attracts much interest because its capaciouslattice space and abundant valency electrons are very beneficial for the formation of Ag conductive filaments (CFs). In this work, multifunctional memristor are successfully fabricated based on Gd‐doped SmB6 nanobelt, interchanging among threshold (TS), self‐rectifying (SR) and bipolar resistance switching (BRS) states by regulating the compliance current. The memristor exhibits a low set/reset voltage (0.92 V/−0.28 V), ultrahigh ON/OFF ratio (≈105), fast switching time (30 ns/35 ns) and extra‐low power consumption (≈7 fJ), overwhelming most known memristors. Furthermore, the memristor can operate well at high temperature up to 300 °C, and still maintain outstanding resistive‐switching characteristics with a slight decay less than 5% even after a month’s continuous operation. Their transition mechanism from volatile to non‐volatile state can be attributed to the surface self‐diffusion effect of Ag CFs. Consequently, this research may shed new light on promoting advanced neuromorphic computing based on nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlthough all‐polymer solar cells (All‐PSCs) have attached increasing attention for their remarkable stability advantages, their photovoltaic performance significantly lags behind organic solar cells based on small molecule acceptors. This is primarily due to their limited entropy increase in the active layer and poor compatibility between polymer donors and acceptors, leading to excessive phase separation. To address this limitation, two novel copolymer donors, PBDTF‐ttTPD and PBDTSi‐ttTPD, are designed and synthesized, which are explored by polymerizing fluorine‐modified benzodithiophene (BDT) and alkylsilyl‐functionalized BDT units with thieno[3,4‐c]pyrrole‐4,6(5H)‐dione (TPD) unit, respectively. Both the two TPD‐copolymers demonstrate comparable energy levels and optical absorption properties, while the incorporating of alkylsilyl groups in PBDTSi‐ttTPD improves solubility, lowers electrostatic potential (ESP), and facilitates optimal molecular stacking. Consequently, the blend film of PBDTSi‐ttTPD:PY‐IT achieves an optimal interpenetrating network, reducing phase separation and significantly improving miscibility compared to PBDTF‐ttTPD:PY‐IT blends. This morphological evolution significantly boosts device performance, including extended carrier lifetime, improved charge transport, and minimized energy disorder. Ultimately, these advancements resulted in a substantial increase in power conversion efficiency, from 13.93% to 18.03%. Furthermore, the relationship between polymer donors/acceptors miscibility and energy loss are deeply explored, providing insights for future optimizations.",

Atomic‐scale transmission electron microscopy reveals that Yb3+ ions substitute Pb2+ sites, establishing robust halide coordination that stabilizes the lattice and enables efficient energy transfer. The synergistic combination of Yb3+ doping and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) modulates perovskite domain phase distribution, driving the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to an exceptional 170%—a notable enhancement for NIR emitters. Transient absorption spectroscopy uncovers a cascaded energy transfer mechanism: photoexcited carriers in low‐n‐phases funnel into the n = ∞ phase, enabling sequential energy transfer to Yb3+ ions and subsequent NIR emission. NIR light‐emitting diodes are fabricated with record‐high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 9.32% at 986 nm and 1.96% at 1540 nm.

    "abstract": "AbstractCopper‐based nanocatalysts, represented by Cu2O nanocubes, are crucial for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to C2+ products but face significant stability challenges. Structural reconstruction from Cu dissolution and reduction under negative potentials undermines their long‐term stability. Herein, a novel Cu2O@CeOx core‐shell nanocatalyst is introduced, featuring a Cu2O nanocube core encapsulated by an amorphous CeOx shell. Due to the facilitated electron transfer of abundant Cu/Ce interfaces, the CeOx shell layer simultaneously prevents the agglomeration and maintains the oxidation state of Cu2O nanocubes, bringing in significantly improved stability. Unlike conventional coating layers, the defective CeOx shell uniquely avoids obstructing mass transfer while effectively promoting the activation of CO2 and optimizing the electronic structure of Cu. The Cu2O@CeOx nanocatalyst delivers a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency exceeding 80% at 300 mA cm−2 under a low applied potential of −0.98 V, with exceptional durability lasting over 50 h, compared to just 2 h for Cu2O alone. This work presents an effective strategy to enhance catalyst stability without sacrificing activity, advancing the design of durable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGlobal warming has led to an increasing demand for cooling solutions, but traditional cooling technologies consume more electricity and increase carbon emissions. Radiative cooling has emerged as a promising alternative, offering sustainable cooling without electricity consumption. Over the past decade, various material designs have demonstrated radiative cooling performance. Particularly, fluoropolymer‐based radiative cooling paints stand out as a practical solution, offering ease of application and scalability. However, its cost is ≈5 times of conventional acrylic paints. By understanding the dependence of reflectance on light wavelength, this study proposes a cost‐effective bilayer polymer design with attractive cooling performance. The top porous P(VDF‐HFP) layer is effective enough to reflect UV and blue light in the solar spectrum and enhance solar stability while reducing the material usage by ≈70%, and the bottom commercial acrylic latex paint reflects the rest of the solar spectrum. This bilayer paint synergistically exhibits relatively high solar reflectance (≈0.9), moderate material cost (≈$1.3 m−2), and excellent UV durability (11 years equivalent). This innovative design achieves a balance between optical performance and economic efficiency, making it a viable candidate for real‐world massive implementation of radiative cooling solutions across various applications.",

This enables mass production of micro‐sized GO modular tapered pipes (GMTPs) scalable to centimeter‐sized structures via stacking. Incorporating undulating structures on the GMTP sidewalls improve structural stability and allow for deformations like bending and twisting.

The nanocarrier can be targeted to the mitochondria, where the enzyme in red blood cell membrane catalyzed endogenous H2O2 to increase O2 content for alleviating hypoxia. Meanwhile, nanozyme exhibits the NADH oxidase (NOX) activity affecting the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/flavin adenine dinucleotide (NADH/FAD) balance in the cellular oxidative phosphorylation, which impairs the mitochondrial electron transport chain and reduces intracellular oxygen consumption, thereby significantly improving tumor oxygen metabolism and the efficacy of SDT. In addition, nanozyme also shows peroxide‐like activity in tumor microenvironment (TME), and generates highly toxichydroxyl radical (OH) for ROS‐amplifying oxidative stress. Deep‐hypothermia potentiated 2D/3D autofluorescence imaging also monitored the nanocarrier effectively disrupt the balance of NADH/FAD in the tumor.

However, the current electrochemical performance of lithium‐ion batteries fails to satisfy the increasingly stringent requirements for fast‐charging capabilities in modern energy storage applications. Central to this challenge is the advancement of fast‐charging graphite anode materials, which play a pivotal role in enhancing fast‐charging performance. Nonetheless, the inherently sluggish lithiation kinetics of graphite anode in LIBs impose limitations on battery capacity, leading to irreversible lithium plating, which has a significantly adverse impact on battery power and cycling performance. This review delves into elucidating the primary factors influencing the fast‐charging capabilities of graphite anodes and dissects the underlying failure mechanisms. And then a comprehensive overview of modification strategies aimed at enhancing the fast‐charging ability of graphite anodes is presented from the view of electrochemical reaction process. Moreover, advanced in situ characterization techniques applicable to key issues in the fast‐charging process of graphite are introduced. Finally, the potential future directions and perspective of mechanism researches and modification methods for fast‐charging graphite anode are highlighted, aiming to drive the advancement of fast‐charging graphite anode in LIBs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogels are routinely used as scaffolds to mimic the extracellular matrix for tissue engineering. However, common strategies to covalently cross–link hydrogels employ reaction conditions with potential off‐target biological reactivity. The limited number of suitable bioorthogonal chemistries for hydrogel cross–linking restricts how many material properties can be independently addressed to control cell fate. To expand the bioorthogonal toolkit available for hydrogel cross–linking, we identify isonitrile ligations as a promising class of reactions. Isonitriles are compact, stable, selective, and biocompatible moieties that react with chlorooxime (ChO), tetrazine (Tz), and azomethine imine (AMI) functional groups under physiological conditions. We demonstrate that all three ligation reactions can form hydrogels, with isonitrile‐ChO ligation exhibiting optimal gelation properties. Synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels cross–linked by isonitrile‐ChO ligation exhibit rapid gelation kinetics, elastic mechanical properties, stability under physiological conditions, and high biocompatibility. By combining ChO‐functionalized multi‐arm PEGs with isonitrile‐functionalized engineered elastin‐like proteins (ELPs), we demonstrate simultaneous control over network connectivity and adhesive ligand presentation, which in turn regulate cell spreading. These hydrogels enable the long‐term culture of numerous human cell types relevant to regenerative medicine. Furthermore, we demonstrate that isonitrile‐ChO ligation is orthogonal to common azide‐alkyne cycloaddition, enabling independent, bioorthogonal functionalization of hydrogels containing live cells.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the air can accelerate their industrialization. However, residual lead iodide (PbI2) in perovskite films is considered a double‐edged sword. This study provides a comprehensive solution to this issue by introducing N, N‐methylenebisformamide (NMF) into the PbI2 precursor solution. On the one hand, NMF molecules regulate the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films, creating sufficient space for the subsequent growth of perovskite films. On the other hand, NMF partially generates formamidinium (FA), which enables in situ conversion of residual PbI2, transforming microcrystals and residual PbI2 into high‐quality perovskite. Concurrently, NMF exhibits lattice compatibility with the perovskite and its presence at grain boundaries and interfaces effectively passivates undercoordinated lead ions in perovskite films. As a result, the optimized device achieves an efficiency of 24.87%, and the unencapsulated NMF‐optimized device retains 93.7% of its initial efficiency after 1680 h of storage in air, also exhibiting excellent thermal stability. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of using organic small molecules to simultaneously improve PbI2 morphology and crystallinity, remove residual PbI2, enhance perovskite crystallization, and passivate defects, enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs entirely under ambient conditions.",

However, there remains a lack of understanding regarding the selection of appropriate pre‐ and post‐annealing relative humidities (RHs). Here, a controlled humidity annealing process is presented to explore the impact of pre‐ and post‐annealing RH on the electrical performance of solution‐processed metal oxides. The results indicate that both high RH pre‐annealing and high RH post‐annealing favor the formation of metal‐oxygen‐metal bonding states and improve the crystallization of the metal oxide films, leading to an optimized electron percolation path for the indium oxide (In2O3) semiconductor channel, decreased leakage current for the aluminum oxide (Al2O3) dielectric, and reduced resistivity for the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. All‐solution‐processed thin film transistors (TFTs) are fabricated utilizing In2O3 as semiconducting channel layers, ITO as source/drain and gate electrodes, and Al2O3 as gate dielectrics. A six‐fold improvement in mobility is achieved when increasing the pre‐ and post‐annealing RH from 10% to 70%, attributed to improved electron percolation path, reduced contact resistance, and fewer electron trap sites. Moreover, the TFTs demonstrate outstanding environmental and electrical stabilities and high reproducibility, as evidenced by the minimal threshold voltage shifts observed during stability tests and the small standard deviations of the device parameters.",

    "abstract": "AbstractStep‐scheme (S‐scheme) semiconductor heterojunctions have attracted considerable attention in photocatalytic solar energy conversion. However, their photocatalytic activity is still limited by the insufficient light harvesting and carrier separation. In this study, a defect‐engineered S‐scheme heterostructure is presented through the rational construction of sulfur/phosphorus‐deficient CdPS3/ZnIn2S4 hybrids for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation driven by wide light absorption and efficient charge separation. The synthetic protocol involves initial fabrication of defect‐rich CdPS3 nanosheets containing sulfur and phosphorus vacancies, followed by growth of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets to establish defective CdPS3/ZnIn2S4 hybrids. Under simulated solar irradiation, the hybrids demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic rates, which is 4.45 and 17.79 times of pristine CdPS3 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. This performance also surpasses many ternary transition metal phosphorus chalcogenides and ZnIn2S4‐based photocatalysts. Mechanism studies indicate that the defect states in CdPS3 can broaden the light absorption and provide an intermediate energy level to accelerate charge separation in the S‐scheme junction, thereby significantly improving light‐harvesting efficiency and suppressing the charge recombination. Meanwhile, the defects can optimize the hydrogen atomic activation energy and expose more active sites to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides fundamental insights into defect‐mediated interfacial engineering strategies for developing high‐performance S‐scheme photocatalysts.",

Current catalysts reported so far can promote the decomposition of Li2CO3 to a certain extent, but are far from sufficient, and the modulation of the discharge product to the more decomposable Li2C2O4 is a promising solution. However, Li2C2O4 exhibits insufficient stability for prolonged cycling processes. Herein, a Mo1.33C@rGO aerogel (MGA), an all‐integrated flexible cathode catalyst, is prepared for Li‐CO2 batteries, where an abundance of mobile electrons produced by the organized Mo vacancies strengthens the bonding between Mo atoms and the intermediate C2O42−, thereby stabilizing it during prolonged cycling and preventing its disproportionation into Li2CO3. At the same time, the oriented 3D framework of MGA provides ordered active sites and well‐organized electron and ion transport channels, reducing charge transfer resistance and facilitating the decomposition of Li2C2O4 with a minimal overpotential of 0.46 V, extending the cycle lifespan to 330 cycles at a current density of 20 µA cm−2. These results highlight MGA's potential as a catalyst for stabilizing intermediates and promoting Li2C2O4 decomposition, offering a promising pathway for efficient, long‐lasting, advanced Li‐CO2 batteries.",

These features enhance their biosafety and responsiveness to toxins from methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The targeting peptides guide the nanoparticles to infection sites, allowing them to accumulate on the MRSA surface. Under near‐infrared irradiation, the photothermal bactericidal effect triggers the antigens release from dead MRSA, creating a diverse bacterial antigen library. PDA coating endows the nanoparticles with robust bacterial antigen‐gathering capacity, enabling in situ vaccination that enhances the antigen presentation process and subsequent MRSA‐specific adaptive immunity. Re‐challenge experiments demonstrated that RBCM@PPPB induced both cellular and humoral immune memory, significantly reducing recurrence risks.

    "abstract": "Functionalizing lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) is an attractive strategy to improve their properties and expand their range of applications. However, conventional approaches to achieve such modifications are done using environmentally and energy‐demanding methods. Here, a green synthetic approach through spontaneous adsorption and laccase‐induced reactions to functionalize LNPs with hemicelluloses is introduced. Structurally varying lignin and hemicellulose grades isolated from different sources and several fungal laccases are systematically compared. Specifically, the residual lignin content in hemicelluloses is hypothesized to determine their adsorption efficacy on LNPs. Results reveal that the LNPs can be coated with hemicelluloses by physical adsorption, which greatly increases their colloidal stability at acidic pH, compared to plain LNPs. Furthermore, fungal laccases can play an active role in attaching lignin moieties of the hemicelluloses at the LNP surface, confirmed by the enriched lignin‐derived compounds and monosaccharide composition of the laccase‐treated hybrid LNPs, compared to the physical adsorption of hemicellulose on the LNP surface. Overall, this study provides new insights on the mechanism of laccase‐assisted functionalization of LNPs with other ligands (e.g., hemicelluloses). Furthermore, the increased colloidal stability of LNPs can greatly increase the application of such hemicellulose–lignin hybrid nanosystems for different areas, such as health sciences.",

    "abstract": "With renewable energy and electric vehicles driving demand, safer and cost‐effective alternatives to lithium‐ion batteries are being sought. This study explores the development of a novel sodium salt, sodium (benzenesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (NaBTFSI), for all‐solid‐state sodium metal batteries (ASSSMBs). NaBTFSI offers a promising electrolyte option by improving sodium‐ion transference number (), conductivity, and stability of sodium metal (Na°) anode cycling. When combined with poly(ethylene oxide), NaBTFSI forms safe solid polymer electrolytes with high mechanical strength, effectively mitigating dendrite growth and polarization issues common in sodium anodes. Characterization shows NaBTFSI enhances the electrochemical performance through π–π stacking interactions, which stabilize the polymer matrix and increase ionic conductivity (≈4.0 × 10−4 S cm−1) at elevated temperatures (70 °C). NaBTFSI‐based electrolytes exhibit higher stability with sodium anodes than the conventional sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt, supporting prolonged cycling in Nao||Nao symmetric cells and demonstrating potential for sustainable, high‐performance ASSSMBs.",

    "abstract": "The application of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(H)‐dependent enzymes in continuous flow reactors poses significant challenges due to the high cost of NAD(H) and its inevitable loss during reactor operation. To overcome these limitations, a novel platform comprising Cry3Aa‐enzyme fusion particles modified with polyethylenimine (PEI) is developed and its application for two catalytic processes is demonstrated. In the first system, two NAD(H)‐dependent enzymes, formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and leucine dehydrogenase (LDH) are genetically co‐immobilized within Cry3Aa particles and then modified with PEI to facilitate NADH co‐immobilization. To adapt the system for continuous flow reactors, PEI‐modified particles are entrapped within agarose beads, loaded with NADH, and then used to catalyze L‐tert leucine production under continuous flow conditions for 30 days. This configuration achieved LDH and NADH turnover numbers of 22,196 and 7,202, respectively, and a space‐time yield (STY) of 0.0262 g L−1 h−1. This platform is then validated for another NAD(H)‐dependent multienzyme system comprised of FDH and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and used for the continuous conversion of ethyl acetoacetate to ethyl‐(R)‐3‐hydroxybutyrate. ADH and NADH turnover numbers of 15,074 and 3,256 are obtained after 30 days with a STY of 0.02 g L−1 h−1. These examples illustrate significant potential of this technology for facilitating NADH‐dependent enzyme‐mediated biocatalysis in continuous flow reactors.",

Although Fe‐N‐C catalysts exhibit the highest ORR activity among Pt‐free systems, their practical application is hindered by durability challenges stemming from Fenton reaction‐induced degradation. Fe‐free M‐N‐C catalysts (M =Co, Mn, Ni, etc.), which mitigate Fenton reactivity, have attracted significant attention; however, their catalytic activities remain markedly lower than those of Fe‐based counterparts. Critical uncertainties persist in establishing structure‐activity‐stability relationships, particularly regarding the interplay between coordination architecture engineering, single‐atom site density, and overall catalytic performance. This review critically examines ORR mechanisms underpinning M‐N‐C systems, evaluates innovative strategies to decouple activity and stability in Fe‐free catalysts, and proposes frameworks to translate atomic‐scale materials into enhanced device‐level performance. Finally, we propose a multidisciplinary roadmap integrating advanced synthesis, operando diagnostics, and machine learning to speed up the development of durable, high‐performance ORR electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Acidic nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3−RR) offers a promising route for a sustainable nitrogen cycle. However, achieving high selectivity and efficiency under low‐concentration acidic conditions remains challenging. Herein, it is demonstrated that Cu nanosponge can adsorb low‐concentration nitric acid (HNO3) and efficiently convert it to ammonia (NH3). The Cu nanosponge is prepared by Cl−‐induced reconstruction of porous Cu nanoparticles obtained through dealloying. In a Cl−‐containing HNO3 solution, porous Cu nanoparticles undergo chemical oxidation to form CuCl, which reconstructs into a nanosponge through migration and electrochemical reduction, consisting of nanoparticle‐supported nanosheets. The nanosponge features abundant porous structures and numerous nanoparticle‐nanosheet interfaces, creating a large active surface area and providing adsorption and reaction sites for NO3−. The optimized Cu nanosponge exhibits a 92% FE for NH3 at −0.4 V versus RHE and 90% yield of NH3 in 0.03 M HNO3, significantly outperforming Cu nanoparticle (only 66 and 47%). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms that the nanosponge structure not only enhances NO3− adsorption but also stabilizes the key NO2− intermediate. Furthermore, industrial wastewater is simulated to convert low concentrations of nitrate into ammonium nitrate products, which are applied to plant cultivation, effectively promoting plant growth.",

This review discusses fluorinated flavonoids and chalcones, focusing on their prospective anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, antiosteoporotic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic applications. The enhanced biological activities of fluorinated derivatives, particularly the antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer properties, are attributed to the introduction of fluorine groups, which increase lipophilicity and metabolic stability. Key findings indicate that fluorinated flavonoids and chalcones exhibit synergistic effects with antibiotics, inhibit bacterial efflux pumps, and reveal potent antiviral and anticancer properties. However, challenges such as cytotoxicity and structural optimisation have to be addressed. The synthesis of fluorinated flavonoids and chalcones is discussed, with emphasis on various synthetic methods such as condensation and cyclisation reactions starting from fluorinated precursors, as well as fluorination strategies, including the use of molecular fluorine or fluorinating agents. Fluorinated flavonoids and chalcones represent candidates for therapeutic development and have the potential to overcome drug resistance. However, further studies are necessary to adjust their pharmacological profiles.",

    "abstract": "Obesity represents a significant global public health issue, contributing to the rising prevalence of metabolic diseases. One treatment for obesity is orlistat, a drug that inhibits pancreatic lipase. It is widely used due to its efficacy in reducing dietary fat absorption. However, patient adherence to this drug is often hindered by its associated adverse effects. As a result, there is an increasing interest in exploring alternative therapeutic options derived from natural sources, such as plants and algae, particularly extracts and their bioactive compounds. These extracts and compounds have shown potential in inhibiting pancreatic lipase and other markers associated with obesity. Nevertheless, they also present certain limitations, including low bioavailability. In this context, combination therapy involving orlistat and these extracts or their compounds has emerged as a promising strategy. This approach aims to enhance the inhibition of pancreatic lipase and other obesity-related markers, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing adverse effects associated with treatment. The objective of this review is to analyze the available scientific evidence regarding the combined effects of orlistat and extracts or bioactive compounds in inhibiting various markers related to dyslipidemia and obesity, with the goal of proposing combination therapy as a safe and effective therapeutic option.",

Being proposed as promising electrocatalysts, bulk oxides, with their compositional and crystal structure flexibility, provide a good platform for studying the correlation between intrinsic activity and electronic structure and also for screening superior catalysts for water electrolysis. In this review, we discuss the recent developments of oxide electrocatalysts in understanding the structure–activity relationship. Firstly, we present a thorough overview of recent advances from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Subsequently, we highlight the design principles to provide guidance for promoting performance. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives about this field are presented.

This has led to an increased interest in the accurate determination of TMAO in human blood, for which a reliable, cost-effective and sensitive analytical method should be established. LC-MS/MS has emerged as a powerful tool for the determination of TMAO due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and ability to handle complex matrices. Herein, we describe the development and validation of an LC-MS/MS method for the determination of TMAO in human blood plasma. Our method involves a simple sample preparation protocol, involving a protein precipitation step along with a non-deuterated IS, followed by a Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Additionally, the method was adapted and implemented on an UPLC-QTOF/MS. The method was validated using the guidelines set by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for assay performance and robustness in human plasma and successfully applied to plasma derived from healthy and hyperlipidemic volunteers. The developed method was found to be specific, sensitive, and accurate for the determination of TMAO in human plasma, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.25 µM. The intra- and inter-assay precision and trueness were within acceptable limits.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the GRPR antagonists PD176252 and RH-1402 can mitigate CIS-induced nephrotoxicity through anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

Among these compounds, 3m exhibited superior renal protection by significantly improving mouse renal tubular epithelial cell (mRTEC) viability from 50.2 ± 2.6% to 80.5 ± 3.9%, surpassing PD176252 (70.8 ± 1.4%) and RH-1402 (73.9 ± 3.7%). Moreover, compound 3m markedly reduced the expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and inflammatory cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1)]. Finally, molecular docking results revealed that 3m exhibited a high binding affinity for GRPR. Computational predictions using SwissADME further indicated that 3m possesses favorable drug-like properties, thereby supporting its potential as a promising candidate for mitigating CIS-induced nephrotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Naproxen sodium is an emerging pollutant that may pose potential hazards to human health and the ecological environment. However, developing highly effective adsorbents for the extraction of naproxen sodium from aqueous environments is still a challenge. Herein, we have prepared a novel amino-functional ionic liquid polymer adsorbent (NH2-IL-PS) for the extraction of naproxen sodium (NPS) from aqueous environments. It was found that the NH2-IL-PS exhibits a high adsorption capacity of 456.6 mg/g for NPS and maintains high extraction efficiency over a wide pH range of 4 to 9 at room temperature. Notably, even when the concentration of NPS was lower than 5 ppb, the extraction efficiency still exceeded 90.0%, with the enrichment factor reaching up to 600.0. More importantly, the NH2-IL-PS adsorbent material can withstand at least 16 consecutive adsorption cycles while maintaining an extraction efficiency of over 90.0%. Finally, the NH2-IL-PS was successfully applied to extract and determine NPS in seven types of real water samples, with relative recoveries ranging from 90.9 to 96.2%. The study of the adsorption mechanism reveals that electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, π-π stacking, and hydrogen bonding are crucial in the extraction of NPS. This study provides a sustainable strategy for the efficient extraction of NPS.",

Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigated Rh segregation in Au–Rh(111) alloys under the influence of adsorbed NO, CO, or O2. The computational results reveal that these adsorbates can markedly alter Rh segregation trends on the Au–Rh(111) surface. Under vacuum conditions, the Rh atom remains preferentially in the bulk of the alloy; whereas, in the presence of adsorption, it segregates to the topmost layer, where NO has the greatest influence, followed by CO and O2. Electronic structure analysis and adsorption energy evaluations further reveal that the strength of the surface–adsorbate interactions critically governs the Rh segregation behavior under reactive conditions. These findings establish a theoretical framework for designing Au–Rh alloys as efficient catalysts for CO oxidation.",

The study's purpose is the isolation and identification of active compounds of C. calcitrapa aerial parts in diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin. The ethyl acetate extract (E2) was separated into eight subfractions by column chromatography. The subfractions were evaluated for their antidiabetic activity using diabetic-induced rats. The most active subtraction was purified, and the active compounds were identified using UV spectrophotometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Mass spectrophotometry, and HPLC. Subfraction E2-VIII showed the most effective reduction in blood glucose levels, comparable to metformin. In HPLC analysis, subfraction E2-VIII showed three main compounds: nepetin, kaempferide, and Luteolin. The nepetin flavonoid was examined using molecular docking, and it showed a high affinity to α-amylase. In conclusion, the aerial parts of C. calcitrapa extract and isolated compounds especially nepetin present promising antidiabetic agents this is probably mediated by its strong antioxidants and α-amylase inhibitory effect.",

Quercetin, as a natural antioxidant, can effectively neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammatory responses, help lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, and support the function of the immune system. CSDs underwent characterization through powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and dissolution rates were evaluated in vitro. Oral absorption assessment was conducted using SD rats, while Caco-2 monolayer cell transmembrane (CMCT) and single pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) were performed to assess the permeability of CSDs. QUR within the CSDs exhibited hydrogen bond interactions with P188 and PEG, displaying stronger interaction parameters (χ) of –4.0 and –6.1, respectively. The crystalline domain of QUR within Poloxamer 188 (P188) was smaller than within polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000). CSDs improved the dissolution rate of QUR, with the P188-CSD slightly outperforming the PEG8000-CSD due to P188’s ability to enhance drug wettability and solubility and to maintain supersaturation. Pharmacokinetic results revealed a 3.5-fold and 25-fold increase in oral absorption for P188-CSD and PEG8000-CSD, respectively, compared to QUR. CMCT and SPIP indicated superior permeability for PEG8000-CSD, potentially attributed to caveolin-mediated PEG transmembrane transport. QUR-CSD significantly enhanced oral absorption, with PEG8000-CSD demonstrating superior efficacy. This improvement was attributed to various factors, including crystalline size reduction, drug wettability enhancement, maintenance of supersaturation by polymers, and caveolin-mediated transmembrane transport.",

    "abstract": "For the interaction of angiotensin II (AngII) with AngII type 1 receptors (AT1R), two potential proton hopping pathways have been identified, each associated with distinct physiological outcomes. The octapeptide AngII (Asp1-Arg2-Val3-Tyr4-Ile5-His6-Pro7-Phe8) appears to form a charge relay system (CRS) in solution in which the C-terminal carboxylate abstracts a proton from the His6 imidazole group, which, in turn, abstracts a proton from the Tyr4 hydroxyl (OH) group, creating a tyrosinate anion. When AngII binds to the AT1R, the CRS can be reconstituted with D281 of the receptor taking up the role of the Phe8 carboxylate in the tripartite interaction, whilst the Phe8 carboxylate forms a salt bridge with K199 of the receptor. As a consequence, the Tyr4 OH of AngII is positioned with accessibility to either the Phe8 carboxylate (bound to K199) or the His6 imidazole (activated by D281), thereby creating a potential gating mechanism for AT1R receptor signaling. This study summarizes evidence based on structure activity data for various analogs wherein Tyr4 OH interaction with His6 imidazole (CRS formation) leads to G protein sequestration and vasoconstriction, whereas Tyr4 OH interaction with Phe8 carboxylate (bound to K199) engenders arrestin-mediated vasodilation and receptor desensitization. These findings, combined with quantum mechanical (semiempirical) calculations of CRS proton transfer presented herein, provide insights for the therapeutic targeting of angiotensin receptor blockers (sartans) and the development of second-generation drugs (bisartans).",

Our findings demonstrate that this coating can lead to high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in these composite MXene-based systems, with silicene exhibiting superior performance compared to graphene. The relevant carbon and silicon atoms in the coated materials serve as active sites for HER due to complex electron transfer processes. Additionally, doping N or P atoms into graphene/silicene, which have similar atomic radii, but larger electronegativity than C/Si atoms, can further enhance the HER activity of adjacent carbon or silicon atoms, thus endowing the composite systems with higher HER catalytic performance. Coupled with their high stability and metallic conductivity, all these composite systems show great potential as electrocatalysts for HER. These remarkable findings offer new strategies and valuable insights for designing non-precious and highly efficient MXene-based HER electrocatalysts.",

CV and EIS showed that the sample had the largest electrochemically active surface area (121.3 mF cm−2) among the samples treated at different temperatures, with the smallest charge transfer resistance.

This study showed that the introduction of N-oxide into the 1,2,5-oxadiazole ring in the acceptor fragment leads to a significant decrease in the luminescence intensity and quantum yield of the dyes. A comprehensive comparison of the photophysical properties of the obtained compounds containing the 1,2,5-oxadiazole ring with the previously studied [1,2,5]thia- and 1,2,5-selenadiazolo[3,4-d]pyridazine analogs showed that the oxygen substitution in the acceptor fragment shifts the phosphorescence maximum from the NIR region of 980–1100 nm to the red region of 690–770 nm. In contrast, for oxygen- and sulfur-containing dyes, purely red fluorescence with a maximum in the spectral range of 620–900 nm is observed. The crystal structures of furoxan-containing 3d·½CHCl3 and furazan-containing 4d exhibit a non-planar [1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-d]pyridazine fragment. We have found that short non-covalent interactions of the furoxan system with a lattice chloroform molecule in 3d lead to luminescence quenching. Meanwhile, in the 4d dye, the intermolecular π-π interactions of pyridazine nitrogen atoms with the N-carbazolyl group of the adjacent molecule should facilitate intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) emission. Thus, the luminescence maxima for these dyes can be tuned across a broad range of 700–1100 nm by varying the number of chalcogen atoms, highlighting the potential for tailoring optical properties in optoelectronic applications.",

In this study, machine learning methods were applied to predict the bandgap and formation energy of double perovskites, aiming to identify promising photovoltaic candidates. A dataset of 1053 double perovskites was extracted from the Materials Project database, with 50 feature descriptors generated. Feature selection was carried out using Pearson correlation and mRMR methods, and 23 key features for bandgap prediction and 18 key features for formation energy prediction were determined. Four algorithms, including gradient-boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), LightGBM, and XGBoost, were evaluated, with XGBoost demonstrating the best performance (R2 = 0.934 for bandgap, R2 = 0.959 for formation energy; MAE = 0.211 eV and 0.013 eV/atom). The SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis revealed that the X-site electron affinity positively influences the bandgap, while the B″-site first and third ionization energies exhibit strong negative effects. Formation energy is primarily governed by the X-site first ionization energy and the electronegativities of the B′ and B″ sites. To identify optimal photovoltaic materials, 4573 charge-neutral double perovskites were generated via elemental substitution, with 2054 structurally stable candidates selected using tolerance and octahedral factors. The XGBoost model predicted bandgaps, yielding 99 lead-free double perovskites with ideal bandgaps (1.3~1.4 eV).

Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using Trans well migration assays and flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of target genes was confirmed through real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), elucidating the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism. The results indicated that BG exhibited a more pronounced effect on ameliorating neuroinflammatory conditions compared to Ginseng under forest (FG). The main active components were found through research and development, including Ginsenoside F1, Ginsenoside Rk1, Ginsenoside Rg3, etc. Among these, Ginsenoside F1 emerged as the most potent active component for treating neuroinflammation, as evidenced by reduced cell migration and apoptosis. The study demonstrates that BG can modulate the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leading to a reduction in the expression levels of AKT1, MAPK1, PIK3CA, EGFR, and other mRNAs. These findings suggest that BG is a promising natural antidepressant, providing both theoretical and experimental foundations for the development of new antidepressants based on BG and its active components.",

    "abstract": "The quinoline moiety represents an important scaffold for the development of leishmanicidal agents. In particular, its hybridization with metal/metalloids has generated highly active compounds that are, in some cases, highly selective against leishmaniasis models. The existing leishmanicidal metal-/metalloid-quinoline compounds are mainly based on the following: (i) coordination compounds based on 8-hydroxyquinolinate; (ii) metallocene derivatives; (iii) N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes featuring a quinoline moiety. This mini-review summarizes the reported cases of leishmanicidal metal and metalloid-based quinoline compounds for each group (i–iii), focusing on the structure-property relationship from in vitro Leishmania models and mechanisms of action, in vivo experiments, and pharmacokinetic data, if available. This paper aims to describe the state of the art of inorganic medicinal chemistry for the development of selective and potent leishmanicidal agents using the quinoline moiety.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNeuraminidase in humans is studied to see how well repurposed oseltamivir works for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using methods like molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and gene expression analysis. Gene enrichment analysis was also studied to understand the behaviour of neuraminidases in humans.MethodsMolecular docking was done using oseltamivir and the neuraminidase proteins with the PyRx tool, and the results were analysed using BIOVIA Discovery Studio. MD simulation (50 ns) of the oseltamivir and neuraminidase complex was performed using GROMACS tools. The gene expression analysis and gene enrichment study were done using GEO2R, which showed the results as log FC and significant values. Enricher tool-based gene enrichment analysis was done to determine the gene behaviour related to the AD.ResultsThe molecular docking showed a strong connection between oseltamivir and neuraminidase (−6.5 kcal/mol), acetylcholinesterase (−7.9 kcal/mol), CDKs (−6.5 kcal/mol), and GSKs (−6.6 kcal/mol), interacting with different amino acids in the protein sequences. MD simulations showed a strong interaction between the ligand and neuraminidase, with stable measurements indicating that both the protein and ligand remained consistent in size and energy, which is better explained through the results of MM_PBSA and MM_GBSA analysis of the complex, resulting in the ΔE_vdW, ΔE_elec, ΔG_polar, ΔG_nonpolar, ΔG_gas, (ΔE_vdW + ΔEEL), ΔG_solvation: (ΔG_polar + ΔG_nonpolar) and ΔG_bind: total energies suggesting the complex stayed stable in conditions similar to those resembling natural cell. The gene expression analysis expressed TUBB3 (formation of beta-tubulin), FABP3 (regulates alpha-synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons), and CALM1 (calcium signal transduction pathway) to be highly upregulated in the given conditions with kinase binding (p = 0.0006541) and protein phosphatase regulatory activity (p = 0.001357) were highly upregulated, implicating their importance in the AD.DiscussionThe study ends on a hopeful note for using oseltamivir to treat neurological diseases, but it suggests that future research should include a solid cell line study, an in vitro study, and a clinical study.",

Results indicate that modified composite MOFs not only exhibit superior water stability but also demonstrate broader applicability in catalysis, such as Fenton-like oxidation, Morita-Baylis-Hillman reactions, ethylene dimerization, and various photoelectrochemical processes. Among them, UiO-67, a zirconium-based MOF, has attracted extensive attention for its exceptional chemical stability, high catalytic activity, and well-defined microporous structure. This review introduces composites formed by different types of single and multi-metal loadings on UiO-67 and their demonstrated catalytic performance. It emphasizes the structure-performance relationships of these composites, highlighting how metal loading and spatial distribution influence their reactivity and stability. The current application status and existing challenges of UiO-67 series materials and their derivatives in catalysis are systematically reviewed.

The design strategies and synthetic methodologies for multichromophoric macrocycles and their structural diversities have been discussed. A covalent synthetic approach in macrocycle design ensures rigidity and precise chromophoric arrangement while a metal coordination driven self‐assembly strategy provides facile access to dynamic structures of 2D metallacycles with tunable (opto)electronic properties. Despite synthetic challenges, macrocyclic architecture offer structural rigidity and minimized excitation traps compared to linear counterparts. This review highlights the key synthetic strategies for metal‐free covalent macrocycles, including condensation, templated cyclization, Prato's reaction, and copper‐catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), alongside noncovalent approaches. The discrete nature, size and shape, and photophysical properties of these multichromophoric FRET macrocycles have been leveraged for various applications such as biomedicine, sensing, in vivo imaging, and photocatalysis and their future applications for host–guest chemistry, nanoreactors for photocatalysis, and optoelectronics are discussed.",

Here, we performed proteomic profiling of plasma and vegetation samples from 238 patients with infective endocarditis and 100 controls, with validation in two external plasma cohorts (n = 328). We developed machine learning-based diagnostic and prognostic models for infective endocarditis, with area under the curve values of 0.98 and 0.87, respectively. Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B4 are potential biomarkers associated with infection severity. Pathologically, protein networks characterized by glycometabolism, amino acid metabolism, and adhesion are linked to adverse events. Liver dysfunction may exacerbate the condition in patients with severe heart failure. Neutrophil extracellular traps emerge as promising therapeutic targets in Streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus infections. Our findings provide insights into biomarker discovery and pathophysiological mechanisms in infective endocarditis, advancing early diagnosis and personalized medicine.",

We confirm clear separation between the TB lesion and adjacent non-lesional tissue, with the lesion samples consistently displaying increased inflammatory profile despite heterogeneity. Using weighted correlation network analysis, we identify 17 transcriptional modules associated with TB lesion and demonstrate a gradient of immune-related transcript abundance according to spatial organization of the lesion. Furthermore, we associate the modular transcriptional signature of the TB lesion with clinical surrogates of treatment efficacy and TB severity. We show that patients with worse disease present an overabundance of immune/inflammation-related modules and downregulated tissue repair and metabolism modules.

To better understand its pathophysiology, we apply advanced single cell methodologies, including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA, and TCR/BCR sequencing, to patient samples from a clinical trial of immunosuppression and growth factor stimulation. We observe opposing changes in the abundance of myeloid cells and T cells, with T cell clonal expansion dominated by effector memory cells. Therapy reduces and suppresses cytotoxic T cells, but new T cell clones emerge hindering robust hematopoietic recovery. Enhanced cell-cell interactions including between hematopoietic cells and immune cells, in particular evolving IFNG and IFNGR, are noted in patients and are suppressed post-therapy. Hematologic recovery occurs with increases in the progenitor rather than stem cells. Genetic predispositions linked to immune activation genes enhances cytotoxic T cell activity and crosstalk with target cells.",

CUP2AI captures 2D molecular size mapping in a single acquisition, granting unprecedented insights into dynamic events across various excitation modes (i.e. both one- and two-photon) and environmental conditions. It enables mapping of molecular volume (500 Å³–80,000 Å³) and hydrodynamic diameter (10 Å–50 Å) based on anisotropy lifetimes. We imaged fluorescein-conjugated dextran in water and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in flames.

Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today’s technologies. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Fréchet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~103 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The detailed anatomy of Termination I (TI) is well depicted, but whether changes across Termination II (TII) resemble TI remains controversial. Here we present high-resolution Asian monsoon records covering TII using Shima Cave stalagmites from China. Correlating marine and ice-core records to our U/Th-dated records via millennial-scale variabilities, we find an initial CO2 rise from 139 ± 1 ka BP concordant with boreal summer insolation increase, which was followed by a major rise phase of CO2 between 135.7 ± 1 and 129 ± 1 ka BP. The major rise phases of CO2 were comparable during TI and TII, but the initial CO2 rise before TII was distinct from CO2 behavior before TI, likely forced by the Earth’s internal variabilities, in particular an ice-sheet collapse event and a 50% reduction in southern hemisphere dust flux. Here, we show that ~4000–5000-year-long gradual changes in CO2, along with insolation rise, preconditioned glacial terminations, supporting the “tipping point” theory.",

The genetic basis for its colonisation and physiological effects remain poorly understood. Here, we show that B. wadsworthia colonises the gut of germ-free male mice fed a high-fat diet by relying on genes involved in microcompartment formation and anaerobic energy metabolism. Using genome-wide transposon mutagenesis, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics, we identify 34 genes essential for gut colonisation, including two clusters encoding a bacterial microcompartment (BMC), and a NADH dehydrogenase (hdrABC-flxABCD) complex. These systems enable B. wadsworthia to metabolise taurine and isethionate, producing H2S, acetate, and ethanol. We further demonstrate that B. wadsworthia can produce and consume ethanol depending on the available electron donors. While B. wadsworthia reached higher abundance and H₂S production in the absence of the simplified microbiota, its co-colonisation with the defined microbial consortium exacerbated host effects, including increased gut permeability, slightly elevated liver ethanol concentrations, and hepatic macrophage infiltration. Our findings reveal how microbial interactions and metabolic flexibility -including using alternative energy sources such as formate- rather than H₂S alone, shape B. wadsworthia’s impact on host physiology, with implications for understanding diet-driven microbiome–host interactions.",

However, much remains unclear regarding coordinated regulation of these cells, particularly in humans. We find that contact with hECs increases hNSPC type B cells, which are GFAP-expressing adult NSPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ), leading to generation of a human type B single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset. Differential gene expression demonstrates an increase in Notch downstream mediators in type B hNSPCs after hEC contact. Blocking hNSPC Notch signaling, and reducing hEC expression of the Notch ligand DLL4, abrogates the effect of hECs on type B hNSPCs. We identify S100A6 and LeX as human type B cell markers, and analysis of the postnatal human SVZ confirms co-expression of GFAP, SOX2, S100A6, LeX and PROM1 in type B cells. Sites of contact are identified between type B hNSPCs and vasculature in the SVZ, providing evidence of human type B cell contact with hECs in the postnatal human brain. Thus, hEC contact promotes human type B cells via Notch signaling and these cells are in contact in stem cell niches in the human brain.",

Here, we present high-precision radioisotopic dates for the Ordovician-Silurian transition in South China that reveal the LOME began at 442.76 + 0.35/−0.22 million years ago, with the two phases lasting for 0.34 + 0.46/−0.34 and 0.06 + 0.31/−0.06 million years, respectively. The rapid switch from icehouse to greenhouse conditions, along with the higher mean rate of temperature change during LOME II, resulted in a much higher mean extinction rate during LOME II than I (71.6% versus 8.4% species loss per 100 thousand years, respectively), implying that the rate of climate change was a primary control on the tempo of the LOME.",

Despite its abundance, the impact of defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, on davemaoite’s properties under mantle conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we use machine learning molecular dynamic simulations to examine the behavior of oxygen-deficient davemaoite structures under high pressures and temperatures. Our simulations reveal its superionic transition driven by oxygen’s diffusion, enhancing electrical conductivities. Our predicted phase diagrams demonstrate that higher oxygen vacancy concentrations expand the superionic phase region. This superionic behavior implies that defective davemaoite could play a critical role in early mantle oxidation and deep-Earth oxygen cycling, providing a potential major source of mobile oxygen in the deep mantle. These findings offer fresh insights into the geodynamic processes in Earth’s early mantle and suggest that oxygen-deficient davemaoite could primarily contribute to the electrical conductivity and oxidation state of the deep lower mantle.",

Despite their significance, the origins of secondary eggshell units remain understudied, leading to debates in paleontology, including the hypothesis of an abiogenic origin for these structures. Here, we demonstrate that secondary eggshell units in non-avian dinosaur eggshells are biogenic in nature, based on analyses using advanced microscopic techniques. The structural characteristics of these units suggest a formation mechanism similar to that of turtle and crocodile eggshells, with matrix fibers likely initiating their development. Furthermore, a diminishing presence of secondary eggshell units in non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs points to the evolution of a more refined physiological process for eggshell formation in this lineage. These findings shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of eggshell biomineralization in dinosaurs and their close relatives.",

Meanwhile, snow loss is also highly asymmetric. These changes are critical for regional agriculture and water management, yet the roles of specific forcings behind them remain unclear. Based on hierarchical large-ensemble climate model simulations, ~32 ± 28% of the surface air temperature (SAT) asymmetric trend and 16 ± 13% of the snow cover asymmetric trend between Eurasia and North America are attributable to tropical Pacific variability. Single-forcing experiments reveal that anthropogenic aerosols can induce a comparable asymmetry, accounting for 34 ± 23% (24 ± 17%) of observed SAT (snow cover) asymmetric trends. However, their effects are largely masked by the greenhouse gas forcing. As anthropogenic aerosol emissions are expected to decline, the current warming asymmetry may reverse in the future.",

However, the layered Au\n            8\n            -P is compressed faster along the\n            c\n            axis, reducing the AR and leading to a flatter Au\n            8\n            core. High-pressure femtosecond transient absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence, and Raman spectra collaboratively confirm that differentiated anisotropic compression notably suppresses nonradiative loss caused by low-frequency vibrations of the Au\n            8\n            core, which is responsible for the piezoluminescence enhancement in Au\n            8\n            -C.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are chronic metabolic diseases with global morbidity and mortality. Decades of evidence from surgical and endoscopic procedures bypassing the duodenum underscore the duodenum’s critical role in regulating glycemia and body weight. Although metabolic surgeries and endoscopic procedures are effective, their invasiveness, cost, and scalability limit patient access. We developed an orally administered mucin complexing polymeric (MCP) drug, designed to replicate duodenal exclusion physiology. MCPs, intended to have electrostatic and covalent cross-linkages with mucin glycoproteins, form extended network structures with resulting alteration of mucus barrier properties. Selective targeting of the duodenum is achieved via pH-based activation chemistry. Following screening for physiochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy, GLY-200 emerged as the lead drug candidate replicating duodenal exclusion physiology with improved glycemia, reduced body weight, and modulation of gut hormones in rodent models. This targeted oral therapy holds promise for treatment of T2D and obesity by mimicking duodenal exclusion without the invasiveness of surgery or endoscopic procedures.",

    "abstract": "Variable stiffness electronics represent the forefront of adaptive technology, integrating rigid and soft electronics in a single system through dynamic mechanical modulation. While gallium’s high modulus tuning ratio and rapid phase transitions make it ideal for transformative electronic systems (TES), its liquid-state instability, high surface tension, and unintended phase transitions during processing pose substantial challenges. Here, we introduce STiffness-Adjustable temperature-Responsive ink (STAR ink), a chemically sinterable gallium composite electronic ink designed to overcome these obstacles. STAR ink enables high-resolution (~50 micrometers) circuit patterning, large-scale batch fabrication, and three-dimensional structure coating at room temperature. Through pH-controlled chemical sintering, STAR ink–based TES exhibits exceptional mechanical tunability (tuning ratio: 1465) and electrical conductivity (2.27 × 10\n            6\n            siemens per meter). Demonstrated applications—from multilayered variable stiffness printed circuit boards (PCBs) matching standard PCBs’ complexity to body-temperature responsive neural probe—underscore STAR ink’s potential for reconfigurable electronics across consumer electronics and biomedical devices.",

The influence of fluorine substituents on their photophysical properties, photoswitching differences, and aggregation in waterin‐ground trans and excited cis‐state is studied. Their photophysical and photoswitching properties are investigated under the polar MeOH and nonpolar solvent benzene and it is found that 6 shows different behavior as compared to 5 in both solvents. Further, to check their aggregation properties in MeOH, a competing solvent water is added. It is observed that in MeOH–H2O solution (0.9‐1.5 mL), compounds show a redshift with a decrease in the absorbance, and fluorescence emission is found. Further, dynamic light scattering shows the opposite behavior, 5 initially is in the macromolecular aggregated state both in trans and cis‐states but the addition of water disperses the solution. However, 6 shows uniform micromolecular aggregated features in the trans‐state and disperses further after the addition of water. Scanning electron microscopy images of 5 and 6 suggest aggregated patterns that change the morphology when added to water. IR, 1H, and 19F NMR are done to understand the site of aggregation and intermolecular interactions.",

    "abstract": "In photoresponsive crystalline porous materials, the light‐driven reversible topological transformation is of particular interest, as it can cause an overall change in structure and lead to more drastic switch in material properties, but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a three‐dimensional (3D) hydrogen‐bonded organic framework (HOF‐OF) self‐assembled by photochromic diarylethene (DAE) and tetrakis(4‐amidiniumphenyl)methane (TAM) via charge‐assisted hydrogen bonds. Light irradiation drives isomerization of DAE, and the internal strain generated during photoisomerization is released through dissolution and recrystallization, which are accompanied by the breaking and reestablishment of hydrogen bonds. Benefit from the weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds and good solution processability of HOFs, solution‐mediated reversible switch between 3D and two‐dimensional (2D) HOF is achieved by ring‐open/ring‐close photoisomerization of the DAE moiety controlled by remotely alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Loading lanthanide complex into HOF enables DAE photoisomerization‐controlled photochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the lanthanide and DAE moiety, resulting in reversible luminescence on/off switch in the host‐guest, capable of intelligent anti‐counterfeiting in a non‐invasive manner.",

Coatings are a highly effective method for preventing equipment from freezing. This paper reviews the research progress of anti‐icing coatings and analyzes future development trends. It evaluates the anti‐icing capabilities of superhydrophobic coatings, slippery liquid‐infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), and energy‐conversion coatings based on their material characteristics and anti‐icing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper examines the anti‐icing applications of single‐and multi‐functional coatings, assesses the advantages and disadvantages of their preparation technologies and material properties, and identifies the main problems in practical applications of current anti‐icing coatings. Finally, it highlights the potential of active anti‐icing functional coatings, particularly energy‐conversion coatings. Through interdisciplinary material innovation and technological exploration, these coatings could enable all‐weather and sustainable anti‐icing solutions.",

In this study, we have investigated the effect of varying the surface density of an artificial MUC1 glycopeptide on gold nanoparticles by co‐loading them with an ovalbumin‐derived peptide. Our results show that reducing the density of the MUC1 antigen on the nanoparticles does not affect the elicited immune response, as high IgG antibody levels were observed in the immunized mice, which were comparable to those obtained with higher antigen loading. These antibodies effectively reacted with natural MUC1 expressed on breast cancer cells, promoted antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity and specifically recognized cancer tissue in immunohistochemical assays. This work could form the basis for the development of AuNP‐based multicomponent vaccines that will allow the incorporation of additional immunostimulatory or complementary antigens in the future without compromising the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen.",

In-cyclo NMR simultaneously resolves kinetic rates and structural information along functional cycles of ATP-driven molecular machines. We benchmark the method on the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of the human Hsp70 chaperone BiP. The protein cycles through ATP binding, hydrolysis, and two parallel pathways of product release. We determine the kinetic rates of all eleven underlying elementary reactions and show these to match independent measurements. The two product release pathways regulate the cycle duration dependent on the products concentration. Under physiological conditions, they are both used. The in-cyclo NMR method will serve as a platform for studies of ATP-driven functional cycles at a remarkable level of detail.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Control of nonlinear interactions in microresonators enhances access to classical and quantum field states across nearly limitless bandwidth. A recent innovation has been to leverage coherent scattering of the intraresonator pump field as a control of group-velocity dispersion and nonlinear frequency shifts, which are precursors for the dynamical evolution of new field states. Yet, since nonlinear-resonator phenomena are intrinsically multimode and exhibit complex modelocking, here we demonstrate a new approach to controlling nonlinear interactions with bandgap modes completely separate from the pump laser. We explore this bandgap-detuned excitation regime through generation of benchmark optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and soliton microcombs. Indeed, we show that mode-locked states are phase matched more effectively in the bandgap-detuned regime in which we directly control the modal Kerr shift with the bandgaps without perturbing the pump field. In particular, bandgap-detuned excitation enables an arbitrary, mode-by-mode control of the backscattering rate as a versatile tool for mode-locked state engineering. Our experiments leverage nanophotonic resonators for phase matching of OPOs and solitons, leading to control over threshold power, conversion efficiency, and emission direction that enable application advances in high-capacity signaling and computing, signal generation, and quantum sensing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Base editors enable the direct conversion of target nucleotides without introducing DNA double strand breaks, making them a powerful tool for creating point mutations in a human genome. However, current Cas9-derived base editing technologies have limited ability to simultaneously edit multiple loci with base-pair level precision, hindering the generation of polygenic phenotypes. Here, we test the ability of six Cas12a-derived base editing systems to process multiple gRNAs from a single transcript. We identify base editor variants capable of multiplexed base editing and improve the design of the respective gRNA array expression cassette, enabling multiplexed editing of 15 target sites in multiple human cell lines, increasing state-of-the-art in multiplexing by three-fold in the field of mammalian genome engineering. To reduce bystander mutations, we also develop a Cas12a gRNA engineering approach that directs editing outcomes towards a single base-pair conversion. We combine these advances to demonstrate that both strategies can be combined to drive multiplex base editing with greater precision and reduced bystander mutation rates. Overcoming these key obstacles of mammalian genome engineering technologies will be critical for their use in studying single nucleotide variant-associated diseases and engineering synthetic mammalian genomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Repression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) is facilitated by KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1)-containing complexes, however the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that binding of KAP1 to the major component of the heterochromatin spreading and maintenance network, HP1α, plays a critical role in silencing of repetitive elements. Structural, biochemical and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the association of the HP1 box of KAP1 (KAP1Hbox) with the chromoshadow domain of HP1α (HP1αCSD) leads to a symmetrical arrangement of HP1αCSD and multimerization that may promote the closed state of chromatin. The formation of the KAP1Hbox-HP1αCSD complex enhances charge driven DNA binding and phase separation activities of HP1α. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analyses using KAP1 knock out mouse embryonic stem cells expressing wild type KAP1 or HP1-deficient KAP1 mutant show that in vivo, KAP1 engagement with HP1 is required for maintaining inaccessible chromatin at ERVs. Our findings provide mechanistic and functional insights that further our understanding of how ERVs are silenced.",

Here, we apply 10 treatments (warming, drought, nitrogen deposition, salinity, heavy metal, microplastics, antibiotics, fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) individually and in combinations of 8 factors to soil samples, and monitor their bacterial and viral composition by metagenomic analysis. We recover 742 mostly unknown bacterial and 1865 viral Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs), and leverage them to describe microbial populations under different treatment conditions. The application of multiple factors selects for prokaryotic and viral communities different from any individual factor, favouring the proliferation of potentially pathogenic mycobacteria and novel phages, which apparently play a role in shaping prokaryote communities. We also build a 25 M gene catalog to show that multiple factors select for metabolically diverse, sessile and non-biofilm-forming bacteria with a high load of antibiotic resistance genes. Finally, we show that novel genes are relevant for understanding microbial response to global change. Our study indicates that multiple factors impose selective pressures on soil prokaryotes and viruses not observed at the individual factor level, and emphasizes the need of studying the effect of concurrent global change treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Time- and cost-saving surveillance of viral pathogens is achieved by tiled sequencing in which a viral genome is amplified in overlapping PCR amplicons and qPCR. However, designing pan-specific primers for viral pathogens with high genomic variability represents a significant challenge. Here, we present a bioinformatics command-line tool, called varVAMP (variable virus amplicons), which addresses this issue. It relies on multiple sequence alignments of highly variable virus sequences and enables degenerate primer design for qPCR or tiled amplicon whole genome sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of varVAMP by designing and evaluating novel pan-specific primer schemes suitable for sequencing the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis E virus, rat Hepatitis E virus, Hepatitis A virus, Borna-disease-virus-1, and Poliovirus using clinical samples. Importantly, we also designed primers on the same input data using the software packages PrimalScheme and Olivar and showed that varVAMP minimizes primer mismatches most efficiently. Finally, we established highly sensitive and specific Poliovirus qPCR assays that could potentially simplify current Poliovirus surveillance. varVAMP is open-source and available through PyPI, UseGalaxy, Bioconda, and https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Charge transfer is fundamentally dependent on the overlap of the orbitals comprising the transport pathway. This has key implications for molecular, nanoscale, and quantum technologies, for which delocalization (and decoherence) rates are essential figures of merit. Here, we apply the core hole clock technique—an energy-domain variant of ultrafast spectroscopy—to probe the delocalization of a photoexcited electron inside a closed molecular cage, namely the Ar 2p\n            54s\n            1 state of Ar@C60. Despite marginal frontier orbital mixing in the ground configuration, almost 80% of the excited state density is found outside the buckyball due to the formation of a markedly diffuse hybrid orbital. Far from isolating the intracage excitation, the surrounding fullerene is instead a remarkably efficient conduit for electron transfer: we measure characteristic delocalization times of 6.6 ± 0.3 fs and  ≲ 500 attoseconds, respectively, for a 3D Ar@C60 film and a 2D monolayer on Ag(111).",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Wetlands provide essential ecosystem services in Africa, yet their extent and fragmentation remain poorly understood. Here we classify African wetlands at 10 m resolution, using seasonal composite imagery and a random forest algorithm. We estimate a total wetland area of 947,750 km² (10% of global wetlands), comprising 46% marshes, 25% swamps, 22% peatlands, 5% seasonal wetlands, and 2% mangroves. Wetland fragmentation is strongly associated with high population densities in countries such as Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea, Egypt, Algeria, and Kenya. African wetlands store an estimated 54 ± 11 Gt of carbon, surpassing Europe’s 12–31 Gt. If drained, they could release 260 MtC yr−¹, nearly ten times the carbon sequestration of pristine wetlands (27 MtC yr−¹). These findings provide a crucial foundation for sustainable wetland management and policy development.",

    "abstract": "Urea fertilization as nitrogen (N) source is essential for increasing crop productivity. However, it results in significant N loss through ammonia volatilization, nitrate leaching, and nitrous oxide emissions, causing environmental harm and economic loss. Urease, an enzyme in soil, rapidly catalyzes urea hydrolysis to ammonia/ammonium. To reduce ammonia volatilization, urease inhibitors delay hydrolysis until urea is dissolved in the soil body. The commercial product N‐(n‐butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) is effective only in certain soils, yet it dominates the current global urease inhibitor market. This study examines the performance of un‐ and substituted dihydroxybenzenes (DHBs) as alternatives to NBPT in two Australian soils. Among them, 4‐fluorocatechol (DHB 6) and 4‐bromocatechol (DHB 8) were more effective in delaying urea hydrolysis than NBPT in acidic sandy loam soil. Michaelis‐Menten kinetics revealed that NBPT acts as a competitive inhibitor, while DHB 8 acts as a non‐competitive inhibitor. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that DHB 8 binds to the cysteine residue in the urease mobile flap, reducing its flexibility and preventing it from assisting urea hydrolysis. This study demonstrates the potential of DHBs as efficient urease inhibitors in certain soils, offering an environmentally viable alternative to NBPT.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) into fuels is a crucial strategy for mitigating climate change and meeting sustainable energy demands. Among catalytic materials, copper stands out due to its ability to convert CO2 into a diverse range of hydrocarbons and oxygenates with significant current density. Quantum mechanical studies have greatly advanced our understanding of CO2ER on copper surfaces; however, most have focused on thermodynamics and/or kinetics to elucidate reaction mechanisms or explain experimental trends, leaving orbital‐level insights largely unexplored. In this study, we employed density functional theory calculations combined with intrinsic bond orbital analysis to track orbital evolution across 13 protonation steps involved in CO2ER to methane. Based on these results, we constructed an arrow‐pushing diagram to illustrate the electron flow for each step. This methodology allows us to identify the key orbital used by each CO2ER intermediate to accommodate the transferred proton. Furthermore, this approach also reveals that the copper electrode actively participates in six protonation steps by exchanging pairs of electrons with CO2ER intermediates that are either selectivity‐determining or rate‐determining steps. These insights deepen our understanding of CO2ER mechanisms and provide a foundation for developing strategies to enhance its efficiency and selectivity.",

The Se⋯N‐based LCEs transition from one‐way to two‐way SME after three days at room temperature, enabling programmable 2D/3D shape transformations and rewritable surface patterns. They also enable the fabrication of light‐powered crawling robots as well as temperature‐responsive knot‐like actuators. These results highlight the critical role of the ChB strength and specificity in designing functional materials. Solid‐state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations provide further molecular‐level insights into ChB interactions, laying the groundwork for advanced supramolecular actuators and shape‐morphing LCEs.",

Although attempts have been made to synthesize functionalized chemicals, a particularly promising product category—C9‐C12 polysubstituted alkylbenzenes with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton—remains largely overlooked. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a coreactant, with the goal of achieving high‐yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 °C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low‐density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt% of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9–C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope‐labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH and in situ FTIR disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation‐mediated C─C bond cleavage and self‐amplifying Friedel–Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway toward the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe introduction of supramolecular (SM) motifs allows the design of stimuli‐responsive polymers whose physical properties can be changed by external triggers that affect the SM binding. However, using this approach to create light‐responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, SM polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross‐links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2‐(4‐methoxy‐styryl)‐4,6‐bis(trichloromethyl)‐1,3,5‐triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self‐reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the SM cross‐links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto‐rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding‐on‐demand (DOD) adhesives was explored in proof‐of‐concept experiments.",

However, the development of efficient and durable photocatalysts remains a significant obstacle. This study introduces the design and performance of a 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction composed of Cu2[CuTCPP] MOF of nanometric size and exfoliated Ti3C2 MXene for visible‐light‐driven overall water splitting. By leveraging the extensive interfacial contact between the two components, an interfacial electric field is generated, promoting efficient charge migration and prolonging carrier lifetimes, as confirmed through systematic density functional theory simulations, in situ irradiation X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. Ti3C2 MXene, acting as a cocatalyst for photohole transport and accumulation, reduces oxidative degradation and slows catalyst deactivation. The synergistically enhanced light absorption properties of the Cu2[CuTCPP]/Ti3C2 heterojunction result in an impressive H2 evolution rate exceeding 5000 µmol gcat⁻1, underscoring its potential for next‐generation photocatalytic systems in renewable energy applications.",

However, current postpolymerization modification strategies result in randomly distributed functionalization along the length of the polymer backbone, which has a negative impact on the crystallinity of the resultant polymers, and thus the thermomechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate an amidyl radical mediated C–H functionalization of polyolefins to access blocky microstructures, which exhibit a higher crystalline fraction, larger crystallite size, and improved mechanical properties compared to their randomly functionalized analogues. Taking inspiration from the site‐selective C–H functionalization of small molecules, we leverage the steric protection provided by crystallites and target polymer functionalization to amorphous domains in a semicrystalline polyolefin gel. The beneficial outcomes of blocky functionalization are independent of the identity of the pendant functional group that is installed through functionalization. The decoupling of functional group incorporation and crystallinity highlights the promise in accessing nonrandom microstructures through selective functionalization to circumvent traditional tradeoffs in postpolymerization modification, with potential impact in advanced materials and upcycling plastic waste.",

Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single‐step approach to produce self‐assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one‐ninth of that produced by conventional solvent‐exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self‐assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high‐molar‐mass lignin models (4,182 g mol−1) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular π–π interactions, stacked conformations, solvent‐specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral‐shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H2O solvent system favors offset‐stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.",

However, the quantitative relationship between CE and electrolyte properties has yet to be established, impeding rational electrolyte design. Herein, an interpretable model for estimating CE based on data‐driven insights of electrolyte properties is proposed. Hydrogen‐bond acceptor basicity (β) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO‐LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. β and HOMO‐LUMO gap of solvents govern anode interphase chemistry. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on β and HOMO‐LUMO gap. Using the new solvent screened by above regression model, the lithium metal anode in the pouch cell with an energy density of 418 Wh kg−1 achieves the highest CE of 99.2%, which is much larger than previous CE ranging from 70%–98.5%. This work provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design.",

    "abstract": "The electrocatalytic oxidative cleavage of the C–C bond is highly effective for converting biomass lignin into high‐value‐added aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the applied oxidative potential usually competes in the aqueous environment. Despite this challenge, this study found that OER does not entirely hinder the cleavage process but rather acts as a synergistic catalytic step. By using defect‐rich carbon nanotubes as the electrocatalyst and combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we found that the reactive oxygen species (O2−) formed before *O2 desorption (the rate‐determining step in OER) serve as the key oxygen source. These species could interact with the enolate intermediate of lignin, which facilitates the in situ production of aromatic compounds. Under the optimal potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 98.8% of 2‐phenoxyacetophenone is converted into phenol and benzoic acid via Cα–Cβ bond cleavage, with yields of 62.31% and 43.42%, respectively. Additionally, the depolymerization of quasi‐natural poplar lignin achieves a total monomer yield of up to 12.41 wt%.

Thus, BhCyNK effectively distinguishes natural killer cells from other immune cells including T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The high specificity of BhCyNK enables real‐time monitoring of TANKs population in the tumor of living mice amid cancer immunotherapies through systemic administration.

Inspired by the anion coordination chemistry of natural phosphate transporters and artificial anion receptors, here, we present the first use of a neutral anion receptor, i.e., bis(tripodal hexaurea) cage 1, as a “single‐molecule carrier” for the delivery of PDs into living cells. Cage 1 features advantages of molecular‐level encapsulation, enhanced intracellular accumulation, subcellular targeting, responsive drug release, and broad adaptability. It enhances PD accumulation in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing the cellular uptake of mono‐, di‐, and tri‐phosphate/phosphonate substrates by up to 45‐fold via a macropinocytosis‐mediated endocytosis pathway.

Herein, a polymeric multi‐dentate anchoring (PMDA) strategy by introducing poly(carbazole phosphonic acid) was employed to engineer the bottom interface and suppress phase segregation. The reinforced and homogeneous anchorage by multiple repeat phosphonic acid groups onto NiOx significantly optimised the bottom interface, suppressing unfavourable interfacial reactions and thus alleviating phase segregation of WBG perovskite. As a result, the PMDA‐modified WBG PSCs showed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the control device (19.84% vs. 18.18%), along with better device photostability (T80 = 1200 vs. 500 h). Coupled with narrow bandgap (NBG) PSCs, the PMDA‐modified PTSCs reached a PCE of up to 28.51% with device operation photostability over 700 h (T80).",

However, Zn dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution on anode side result in limited lifespan and safety issues. Herein, an organic‐inorganic‐integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was in situ formed by adding 4‐(trifluoromethyl)‐1H‐imidazole (TFMI) as an electrolyte additive. The artificial SEI merited higher maximum elastic deformation energy due to relatively high resilience and toughness, which can prevent Zn dendrite penetration and anode self‐cracking and pulverization. In addition, N‐containing heterocycles in SEI act as a H+ catcher, thereby inhibiting anode corrosion and hydrogen evolution. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell has delivered stable cycling performance after 1500 h at 5 mA cm−2 with a terminated capacity of 5 mAh cm−2.

Our mesoporous MOPs, featuring internal cavities of up to 12.5 nm3, withstand the activation process, enabling their use as solid‐state adsorbents for gases and water. In particular, the largest mesoporous MOP, named BCN‐17, captures up to 0.47 gwater·gMOP−1 and exhibits an S‐shaped water‐sorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop, characteristic of mesoporous materials.",

Herein, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA) is introduced as a novel solvent for LMB electrolytes. The unique ether‐oxygen functionality in PMA exhibits high steric hindrance, leading to weak lithium‐ion coordination, which promotes the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the electrolyte solvation structure, especially in the presence of dual salts. A Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery employing the formulated PMA‐based electrolyte demonstrates stable cycling at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.5 V for over 100 cycles, retaining 90.1% of its initial capacity even at 60 °C. Furthermore, a molecular interfacial model is proposed to elucidate the impact of the designed electrolyte on electrode interfacial behavior and battery performance, providing valuable insights for the development of high‐performance LMB electrolytes.",

Facilitating proton transfer through rational catalyst design to reduce the applied potential enables effective and durable CO2 reduction. Herein, a proton migration promotion strategy to accelerate the CO2 protonation and the overall ECO2R process was explored by Sn‐based cyanamide catalysts. Catalysts with varying [NCN]2− content, from SnO to Sn2ONCN and SnNCN, were investigated to elucidate the proton transfer mechanism of build‐in [NCN]2−. The reversible structural transformation between [N═C═N]2− and [N≡C─N]2− from [NCN]2− group achieves an efficient proton relay effect. More efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH is achieved with a higher content of build‐in [NCN]2− groups in structures. Among these catalysts, SnNCN showed a current density of 450 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 360 mV, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.4% for HCOO− production and a peak cathodic energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 79.6%. Furthermore, it produced formate (HCOO−) continuously for over 110 h at 200 mA cm−2 and pure formic acid (HCOOH) solution for 192 h at 135.8 mA cm−2. This study provides a novel material system and a fresh perspective for the design of efficient ECO2R catalysts.",

Despite recent breakthroughs in protein design and structure prediction, designing novel biocatalysts remains challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform integrating cutting‐edge protein engineering algorithms within an evolutionary framework (https://github.com/bunzela/AIzymes). By combining bioengineering tools such as Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes can optimize a broad range of catalytically relevant properties. In addition to enhancing transition state affinity and protein stability, AI.zymes can also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes can enhance electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with stronger catalytic electric fields. Benchmarking AI.zymes on the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of ketosteroid isomerase led to a 7.7‐fold activity increase after experimentally testing just 7 variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a unifying framework for enzyme design.",

Synthesis from chloride‐containing metal salts gave metal complexes chemisorbed on the supported nanoislands, with Pt being prototypical and having a structure approximated as Pt1Cl2O4, as shown by X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and calculations at the level of density functional theory (DFT). Calcination converted the adsorbed species into a structure represented as Pt1O6, embedded in the CeOx lattice. The Pt1Cl2O4 was observed to have a higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation than the chloride‐free, embedded Pt1O6 species, and DFT results indicate the role of chloride in enhancing the catalytic activity of the isolated Pt, in contrast to its role as an inhibitor when Pt is present as nanoparticles.

Here, materials formed from different post‐reaction processing methods of the same ROMP block copolymer exhibit different block‐specific solvent responses, as characterized in situ by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). FLIM data were acquired by tagging the polar or nonpolar block separately with a covalently incorporated viscosity‐sensitive fluorescent molecular rotor to measure the changing tightness or looseness of assembly upon changes in solvent composition. Rapid precipitation from an insoluble solvent to form a film results in tighter assembly and less difference in tightness/looseness between the two blocks. Further, it interrupts individual block‐solvent response behavior. Both results indicate an apparent disruption of the core–shell assembly. This model from FLIM is further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) data from isolated solids, which show tighter long‐range interactions and more long‐rage order in these kinetically trapped states. The experiments develop FLIM as a method for pinpointing stimuli‐responsive behaviors from different processing methods to individual blocks. Together these outcomes provide a future handle for tailoring solvent‐triggered assembly/disassembly behavior.",

The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E‐ and the metastable Z‐isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV‐Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, for example, to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic‐to‐isotropic phase transition upon irradiation",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolvent‐free organic reactions have proven to be a sustainable strategy in organic synthesis, such as mechanochemical, microwave‐assisted, and ultrasound‐irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent‐free chemistry. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability, and excellent light‐harvesting capability, enabling them to serve as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent‐free thermal‐induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrroles have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded PPy‐BS, which achieved the highest photothermal performance (241°C under 100 W halogen‐lamp irradiation). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) analyses suggest that the excellent photothermal performance of PPy‐BS is likely attributed to the well‐organized assembly based on the uniform particle. On this basis, PPy‐BS was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels‐Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent‐free conditions. All trials afforded good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, PPy‐BS photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability, a high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000 mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of PPy‐BS photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up‐scalable, and solvent‐free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA comprehensive study of a single‐benzene fluorophore, characterized by a low molecular weight and a significant Stokes’ shift, is reported. The fluorophore exhibits crystallization‐induced emission enhancement and pH‐dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of nonemissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited‐State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state and rationalized the large Stokes’ shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli‐responsive properties.",

In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2‐amino‐4‐pyridyloxenium cation.",

While cryo‐electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric αSyn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod‐like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid‐state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C‐terminal domain of the monomeric αSyn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C‐terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C‐terminal domain that influences αSyn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of αSyn.",

Two complexes, Ru‐Me2alloxB and Ru‐Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light‐driven charge accumulation and subsequently synthesized. The electrochemical characterization of Ru‐Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time‐resolved emission, and time‐resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly reduced complex were modelled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. These results underline the promising multielectron storage capacity of the newly designed π‐extended alloxazine ligand.",

Therefore, diameter‐selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present a novel approach for size‐tunable diameter separation of single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal‐coordinating supramolecular polymers (M‐PNB) consisting of phenanthroline‐based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M‐PNB is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 – 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 – 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M‐PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)‐SWNTs. This method offers not only size‐tunable diameter selectivity but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.",

However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in 2D systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange‐red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+‐induced extrinsic self‐trapped exciton (STE), which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange‐red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%–51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation‐dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high‐performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe strategic utilization of self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly advances the interfacial contact and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, inadequate adhesion between the SAM and perovskite layer remains a critical challenge, limiting further performance enhancement. Herein, a synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co‐assembly approach with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. Specifically, 11‐Mercaptoundecylphosphoric acid (MPA) is incorporated into a SAM to form co‐SAMs, improving homogeneity and mitigating defects at the NiOx surface. Simultaneously, the ionic liquid (IL) monomer 1‐Allyl‐3‐vinylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) imide (AVMTF2) is incorporated into the perovskite precursor. The aggregation of ILs cation at the bottom interface facilitates in situ polymerization via sulfhydryl end groups, forming the POL‐AVM polymer at the perovskite/SAM interface. This polymer enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds. As a result, this synergistic strategy achieves a champion PCE of 26.25% (certified 26.04%), along with excellent long‐term stability, retaining 95.6% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under the ISOS‐L‐2I protocol.",

While cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for destroying tumor cells, they lack the ability to eliminate bacteria. Here, the artificial T cells (ATC) are presented for tumors, particularly those colonized with intracellular bacteria. The ATC is composed of a hydrogel framework made of disulfide‐linked chitosan and hyaluronic acid, encapsulating T cell‐derived granzyme B and phage‐derived holin. This design leverages the tumor microenvironment for the targeted release of these antitumor and antibacterial agents to precisely kill tumor cells and intracellular bacteria. In vivo studies demonstrate the debris from ATC‐mediated destruction acts as an immune stimulator, promoting immune cell infiltration and inhibiting tumor migration. This work highlights the potential of ATC therapy in achieving targeted treatment and robust anti‐tumor immunity, advancing the field of artificial cell technologies for precision medicine.",

Recently, this technique has been used to form a 3D racetrack memory device by transferring a complex magnetic thin film heterostructure, in the form of a membrane, onto a corrugated surface. The membrane is released using a water‐soluble oxide layer (Sr3Al2O6). The magnetic structure within the membrane is supported by a thin buffer layer (MgO), which decouples the magnetic structure from the receiving surface. Here it is shown that ultrathin freestanding racetrack membranes can be formed without any buffer layer and that the current‐induced motion of magnetic domain walls within the transferred racetrack is highly efficient. Furthermore, the absence of any buffer layer enables local engineering of the racetracks via their direct coupling with pre‐patterned platinum underlayers on which they are placed. The presence or absence of the Pt underlayer allows for local modulation of the current and field‐induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization. In addition, the ultrathin freestanding membranes exhibit excellent flexibility and enable highly reliable racetrack devices. The findings highlight the potential of freestanding magnetic heterostructure membranes for advanced spintronic applications.",

Herein, a belt‐like nano‐heterojunction Cu2O/CuVO3 (CVO) is developed as a potential redox dyshomeostasis inducer by exacerbating ROS levels and compromising antioxidant defense without the need of exogenous stimulations. Steady‐state analysis reveals that CVO exhibits extraordinary reaction velocity and catalytic efficiency (Vmax = 2.32 µm s−1, Kcat = 0.49 s−1) in the production of hydroxyl radicals (·OH). Likewise, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superb charge‐transferring properties in the heterojunction structure and unique surface coverage rate of CVO primarily dominate the high‐efficient catalytic reactions. Noteworthy, CVO is capable of inducing mitochondria dysfunction by aggravating the cellular redox imbalance, thereby triggering multiple cell death pathways and generating synergistic effects. Transcriptomics analysis outcomes further demonstrate that CVO exerts significant and distinct effects on key biological processes in tumor cells, encompassing but not limited to canonical pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuprotosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the pronounced tumor‐inhibitory efficacy of CVO, which paves a promising pathway for the development of novel nanocatalysts that effectively target cancer through the amplification of redox dyshomeostasis.",

In this study, the rational design of a biocatalytic and redox‐regulated nanoarchitecture comprising Ru cluster‐anchored hydroxylated Fe2O3 (Ru‐HFO) encapsulated within bone marrow stem cell‐derived extracellular vesicles (BEVs), for precision inflammation modulation to combat RA is proposed. When combined with ultrasound (US) stimulation, this biocatalytic and inflammation‐targeting nanoarchitecture (BEVs@Ru‐HFO) can reprogram macrophages and osteoclasts to restore redox and immune homeostasis, thereby alleviating RA. The findings reveal that the hydroxylation strategy enhances electron density at Ru redox centers and fine‐tunes the binding affinity of oxygen intermediates, thereby ensuring exceptional multi‐enzymatic ROS‐scavenging activities. Notably, under ultrasonic irradiation, BEVs@Ru‐HFO targets inflamed joints, promotes the local accumulation of anti‐inflammatory macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates the hypoxic microenvironment to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. This ultimately confers bone and cartilage protection and restores joint function. It is posit that this biocatalytic and redox‐regulated nanoarchitecture, with its superior antioxidant and immunomodulatory capabilities, represents a promising strategy for engineering ROS‐catalytic materials to treat RA and potentially many other autoimmune diseases.",

However, challenges such as low bacterial survival under harsh gastrointestinal conditions, difficulties in achieving long‐term colonization, and unclear therapeutic targets limit their effectiveness. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed that integrates genetic and chemical engineering for intestinal flora regulation in UC treatment. This strategy employs bacterial programmability and gene editing to produce bactericidal agents that dynamically modulate the intestinal microecology and utilize controlled chemical modifications to enhance bacterial resistance. Using Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as a model, a polyelectrolyte composite coating is developed that significantly increased bacterial survival in the gastrointestinal tract—40‐fold in the stomach and 74‐fold in the small intestine. Additionally, EcN::mcmA is engineered to overproduce iron‐carrier microcins (MccM) with a “Trojan horse” mechanism to target and disrupt pathogenic bacteria. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)‐induced mouse UC model, EcN::mcmA@P/O treatment effectively reduced inflammation and improved intestinal flora regulation, presenting a promising and potentially safer long‐term solution for UC.",

An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on‐demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi‐modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity. The versatility of optical printing regarding the usability of a broad range of substrates and the ability to create arbitrary patterns with tunable dimensions are also shown.",

Concurrently, the harnessing of infrared (IR) light, which constitutes ≈50% of solar energy, has predominantly remained unexploited due to a pronounced contradiction between the utilization of IR light and CO2 photoreduction. To break the above limitation, a dual‐plasmon resonance conductor with a metallic nature is designed, which realizes the synthesis of CO with 100% selectivity from infrared photothermal catalytic reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Taking the Au particles loaded Cu7Te4 nanowires as an example, the surface dual‐plasmon resonance coupling effect can optimize the three critical processes of CO2 photoreduction, in which it is illustrated that the dual‐plasmon resonance effect lowers the thermodynamic reaction energy barrier, facilitating the selective generation of CO products. Consequently, the Au‐Cu7Te4 nanowires manifest a CO evolution rate of ≈2.7 µmol g−1 h−1 with 100% selectivity for atmospheric CO2 reduction driven by IR light, several times higher than that of the Cu7Te4 nanowires.",

Hard carbon anodes, characterized by their pseudo‐graphitic layered structures and nanoporosity, are key to achieving high‐performance SIBs. However, the commercialization of hard carbon is hindered by significant challenges in precursor design, carbonization optimization, and sustainability. This review focuses on the critical role of precursor selection and introduces a classification system based on volatile content. High‐volatility biomass precursors, such as bamboo, require pretreatments like acid/alkali leaching or hydrothermal processing to optimize pyrolysis. Medium‐volatility resins and plastics benefit from crosslinking strategies, while low‐volatility materials such as biochar and petroleum coke rely on nanochannel engineering to improve sodium storage performance. Bamboo‐based precursors are highlighted as a promising pathway due to their renewability and environmental advantages, though challenges such as impurity control and structural engineering persist. By integrating precursor design with carbonization strategies, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding microstructural regulation and performance enhancement. The insights presented offer valuable guidance for developing scalable and sustainable approaches to produce high‐performance hard carbon materials, paving the way for the next generation of SIB technologies.",

Here, this study proposes dual‐phase interface engineering strategies to reconcile these conflicting requirements through molecularly interlocked conductive elastomers. Dynamic stress dissipation through dynamic bond plasticity is achieved by embedding a 3D interpenetrating conducting elastomer network within the electron transport layer (ETL). The strategy creates gradient modulus interfaces through Ag coordination‐enabled nanocomposite bonding, suppressing crack propagation velocities and reduces the interfacial mechanical mismatch phenomenon. Eventually, the PCE of 19.58% is achieved on the small‐area flexible devices, which is one of the highest PCEs for flexible organic solar cells (f‐OSCs) to date. Notably, the stretchable devices retain over the PCE of 10% under 100% tensile strain, surpassing previous stretchable photovoltaic devices. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large‐area module applications, 25 cm2‐based flexible and stretchable modules are prepared with PCEs of 16.74% and 14.48%, respectively.

The development of high‐performance phototransistors necessitates materials with both high charge carrier mobility and robust photoresponse. However, achieving both in a single material poses challenges due to inherent trade‐offs. Herein, this study introduces a polybenzimidazole‐(1,3‐diazole)‐based 2D polymer (2DPBI), synthesized as few‐layer, crystalline films covering ≈28 cm2 on the water surface at room temperature, with large crystalline domain sizes ranging from 110 to 140 µm2. The 2DPBI incorporates a π‐conjugated photoresponsive porphyrin motif through a 1,3‐diazole linkage, exhibiting enhanced π‐electron delocalization, a narrow direct band gap of ≈1.18 eV, a small reduced electron–hole effective mass (m* = 0.171 m0), and a very high resonant absorption coefficient of up to 106 cm−1. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals excellent short‐range charge carrier mobility of ≈240 cm2 V−1 s−1. Temperature‐dependent photoconductivity measurements and theoretical calculations confirm a band‐like charge transport mechanism. Leveraging these features, 2DPBI‐based phototransistors demonstrate an on/off ratio exceeding 108, photosensitivity of 1.08 × 107, response time of 1.1 ms, and detectivity of 2.0 × 1013 Jones, surpassing previously reported standalone few‐layer 2D materials and are on par with silicon photodetectors. The unique characteristics of 2DPBI make it a promising foundation for future optoelectronic devices.",

However, current progress faces challenges in balancing weather adaptability, functional tunability, and fabrication costs. This study introduces an all‐season, polyvinyl propional‐liquid‐based asymmetric window. It features a tunable switching temperature ranging from 10 to 70 °C, maintains transparency at temperatures as low as −15 °C for extended periods, and delivers optimal net cooling (≈246.5 W m−2) and heating (≈113.9 W m−2) power as derived from the modulation of the optical spectrum, and boasts a service life of over 8 years, with resistance to 1000 thermal shock cycles. The synthesis of the polyvinyl propional liquid involves a zero‐emission process, and the transparent‐to‐cloudy phase transition provides a visually identifiable and theoretically predictable indicator for reaction termination. Additionally, the liquid contains an in situ doped dispersant that functions as a cryoprotectant. Encapsulated between an outward‐facing transparent glass layer and an inward‐facing low‐emissivity glazing, the asymmetric window directional scattering of solar radiation and thermal re‐emission, effectively delivers net cooling in summer and heat retention in winter. This window presents a complementary, affordable, and sustainable solution for enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in diverse climatic conditions.",

These electrically conductive, yet plastic‐like composites display mechanical qualities of rigid thermosets and recyclability through a dynamic covalent polymer network. The composite exhibits a high glass transition temperature, good solvent resistance, high electrical conductivity, and recyclability. The vitrimer synthesis proceeds without the need for a catalyst or a high curing temperature, which enables facile fabrication of the composite materials. The as‐synthesized vitrimer exhibits a fast relaxation time with reconfigurability and shape memory. The electrically conductive composite exhibits high electrical conductivity with LM volume loading as low as 5 vol.%. This enables the fabrication of fully vitrimer‐based circuit boards consisting of sensors and indicator LEDs integrated with LM‐vitrimer conductive wiring. Electrical self‐healing and thermally triggered material healing are further demonstrated with the composites.

    "abstract": "AbstractAnode‐free Li‐ion batteries (AFLBs) and Li‐metal batteries (LMBs) offer superior energy densities compared to conventional Li‐ion batteries with graphite anodes. However, they degrade faster owing to their lower Coulombic efficiency, primarily caused by uneven Li deposition on the current collector (CC) in AFLBs or the Li‐metal anode (LMA) in LMBs. Coating CCs and LMAs has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the CE. Coating CCs and LMAs with PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2—metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides—reveals the critical factors for achieving uniform Li plating. The PtTe2 coating facilitates rapid Li surface diffusivity, while the PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings provide shorter diffusion paths for Li adatoms on the CCs and LMAs. In addition, Li2Te, formed as a byproduct of the decomposition of PdTe2 and NiTe2 during Li plating, reduces the critical nucleus size by minimizing the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and the plated Li. PtTe2 more effectively enhances the AFLB cycling performance, whereas PdTe2 and NiTe2 are more advantageous for LMBs. Notably, a 5‐nm‐thick PdTe2 coating on the LMA achieves 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles using a LiFePO4 cathode (3 mAh cm−2) at a 0.5 C‐rate.",

However, their temperature‐dependent ferroelectric behaviors, particularly at the nanoscale, remain poorly understood. In this study, the nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution with temperature and ferroelectric‐to‐paraelectric phase transition in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 films are investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Angle‐resolved lateral PFM (LPFM) reveals a complex in‐plane ferroelectric domain structure. Temperature‐dependent LPFM measurements clearly show that the Curie temperature (TC) is ≈353 K, as confirmed by other macroscopic measurements. Notably, it is observed that the ferroelectric‐to‐paraelectric phase transition initiates locally even below TC. As the temperature increases, large ferroelectric domains fragment into smaller ones and the regions with the novel LPFM phase signal emerge, indicating a local phase transition. Furthermore, temperature‐dependent LPFM spectroscopy demonstrates a progressive weakening of the ferroelectricity. The analysis based on Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire theory identifies a second‐order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of nanoscale ferroelectric domains observed in LPFM images. This spatially resolved observation of phase transition provides critical insights into the temperature‐dependent ferroelectric properties of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics and establishes a foundational framework for their future device applications.",

The NPC effect can be derived from the trapping effect of the up‐conversion layers, endowing the controllable photo‐resistance by incorporation with UCNPs via a systematic variation of defect state density. Thus, the positive response is observed with the responsivity (R) of 41.22 mA W−1 and detectivity (D*) of 3 × 10⁸ Jones under 500 nm illumination at 10 V, and the device exhibits the negative response with the R of 100.24 µA W−1 and D* of 7.91 × 10⁵ Jones under 980 nm illumination, resulting in an excellent spectral distinguishability at each light intensity with the recognition ratio of 3.9 × 10⁵ suggests.

Using chimeric phosphodiester‐phosphorothioate DNA and dual‐thiol grouped aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer as co‐ligands, monovalent DNA‐modified quantum dot (QD) is synthesized with strong photosensitization via efficient energy transfer between QD and the surface‐coordinated photosensitizers. Through DNA‐programmed assembly with a peroxidase‐mimetic platinum‐shelled gold nanoparticle (GNP@Pt), a core‐satellite GNP@Pt‐QDs/AIE nanoprobe is constructed that completely quenched both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Upon response to miRNA target, QDs are programmatically disassembled from the nanoprobes, leading to amplified fluorescence and photodynamic activity. Concurrently, the steric hindrance of the platinum shell is relieved with oxygen‐independent chemodynamic activity restored. More significantly, the mild photothermal effect under near‐infrared (NIR) irradiation can accelerate the disassembly to fast activate fluorescence and ROS output. Excellent performances in miRNA‐21 target imaging and chemodynamic‐photodynamic synergistic anticancer therapy are achieved in vitro and in vivo with negligible cytotoxicity. This NIR‐photoaccelerable nanoprobe, capable of imaging miRNA biomarkers in situ and synergizing chemodynamic‐photodynamic therapy, offers great potential for the early diagnosis and treatment of malignancies.",

In this study, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid‐state electrolyte particles are incorporated onto the surface of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes, which lowers the activation energy (Ea) for interfacial lithium ions (Li+) transfer and enhances the diffusion kinetics of Li+. As a result, ultrahigh loading (54 mg cm−2) cathodes are fabricated, demonstrating a remarkable areal capacity of up to 10.4 mAh cm−2 and a high energy density of 473 Wh kg−1 when applied in a lithium metal battery. The interphase properties analysis indicates that the application of LLZO at the solid/liquid interface facilitates the formation of a comprehensive and stable electrode interface layer to fully cover the surface of cathode material, which effectively suppresses side reactions and prevents the particle crack and structure degradation over cycling. These results suggest that the incorporation of LLZO as an additive in dry‐film cathodes holds great promise for sustainable and cost−effective manufacturing of high‐energy‐density lithium metal batteries.",

Bilirubin is distinctive among protein‐bound toxins because its photodecomposition products are hydrophilic and readily dissociate from albumin. Inspired by phototherapy for neonatal jaundice, an innovative multifunctional adsorbent is proposed and equipped with self‐photodecomposition and visual monitoring abilities. Herein, inverse opal beads (IOBs) is developed through strategic nanoarchitectonics. The periodic ordered structure of the IOBs imparts a self‐hosted blue light emission property that facilitates the bilirubin photodecomposition. Additionally, the interconnected pores of the IOBs enhance the adsorption of bilirubin photodecomposition products. Moreover, the colors of the IOBs change in response to the amount of adsorbed bilirubin photodecomposition products, allowing for real‐time visual monitoring of the adsorption state during hemoperfusion. These features allow the IOBs to effectively compete with albumin for toxin binding. In hyperbilirubinemia rats, the total bilirubin (TBIL) clearance ratios achieved by the IOBs and a commercial adsorbent (BS330) are 45.1% and 29.3%, respectively. Notably, albumin (ALB) concentration decreased by 31.8% after treatment with BS330, whereas no significant change is observed in the IOB‐treated group.

    "abstract": "AbstractPliable integration of metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with polymers enables precise separations, advancing circular economy initiatives. Maximizing the pore functionality of MOFs is critical for rapid ion sieving but necessitates a uniform and stable distribution to expose their interpenetrated nanochannels. Here, this work reports a controlled approach for integrating an ultrathin Zr‐MOF monolayer with a flexible polyamide film using a coupled cathode electrophoretic deposition and interfacial polymerization (CED‐IP) strategy. By tuning the electric field intensity, this work achieves uniform monolayer coverage of diverse MOFs (UiO‐66, MOF‐808, and NU‐1000) with varying pore apertures on porous supports, followed by the formation of a thin‐film nanocomposite (TFN) configuration via confined IP. The exposed functional groups within these MOF pores enhance interaction with aqueous‐phase diamines, which polymerize with acyl chlorides, resulting in TFN membranes with a moderately reduced crosslinking degree, improved hydrophilicity and enhanced surface electronegativity. Experimental and simulation data reveal that the large‐pore NU‐1000 offers the lowest transport resistance in polyamide membranes, leading to an exceptional 186.3% increase in water permeance compared to control membranes. The resulting Zr‐MOF‐integrated polyamide membrane demonstrates outstanding selectivity for WO42−/Cl− (50.6) and MoO42−/Cl− (53.7), outperforming most MOF‐based nanofiltration membranes. These results underscore the potential of a mesoporous MOF‐monolayer based TFN membranes for low‐energy extraction of critical rare metals.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFerroelectric polymer‐based electrocaloric (EC) materials are promising for next‐generation solid‐state refrigeration due to their high entropy change, eco‐friendliness, lightweight, and flexibility. The practical application of ferroelectric polymer is significantly constrained by its limited EC performance. The prevalent strategy of incorporating ceramic fillers to enhance EC performance contradicts the requirement for high electric breakdown strength (Eb). In this study, a novel approach is utilized that incorporates hydroxy‐containing organic molecules as sacrificial templates to induce polar entities at the interfaces and create nanopores after evaporation. Based on that, nanopores interface engineering is proposed by systematically elucidating the influence of organic molecular structure and dimensions on nanopore size and interfacial polar phase and revealing an approach for precisely regulating nanopore dimensions and interfacial polar phase. The optimal sample achieve a remarkable entropy change (ΔS) of 94.51 J·kg−1·K−1 and temperature change (ΔT) of 18.47 K at 150 MV m−1 with 124% enhancement, facilitated by weakened correlation of polar phases and massive existence of microcrystals. Since nanopores do not act as macroscopic defects that significantly expedite the breakdown phase's growth, a high Eb of 365 MV m−1 is preserved. This work provides a viable strategy for developing eco‐friendly, high‐performance, and safe EC materials.",

However, such materials are rare due to the challenge of simultaneously fulfilling the requirements for high adhesion, on‐demand peelability, recyclability, and surface antifouling functionality. Herein, a novel strategy is presented for preparing a gradient antifouling coating with high adhesion, on‐demand peelability, and superior recyclability that involves the modular construction of three components that work together synergistically. Self‐reinforcing thiol‐capped polysilsesquioxane (POSS‐SH, module 1) reacts with isocyanate‐terminated polyurethane (NCO‐PU, module 2) to form a cross–linked network with strong cohesion, and reactive amphiphilic polymer (RAP, module 3) self‐enriches on the coating surface to exert fouling resistance against proteins, bacteria, diatoms, and biofilms. Meanwhile, the coating achieves strong adhesion to a substrate by hydrogen bonds and high recyclability owing to dynamic thiourethane bonds. By leveraging the synergies between modules, the gradient coatings showcase superior antifouling ability, high adhesion strength (≈3.5−9.0 MPa), easy peelability (≈1.5−5.5 N·cm−1), high transparency (>85% transmittance), and recyclability. It is expected to be useful as a temporary or durable antifouling coating in marine applications such as underwater sensors and robots.",

However, optimizing these biochips remains challenging due to complex interdependencies among critical fabrication parameters. Here, a machine learning (ML)–guided workflow is developed combining cell viability assays, data augmentation, ensemble modeling, and model interpretation to predict the viability of isolated cortical rat neural stem/progenitor cells (rat NSPCs) and extract data‐driven insights. Initially, rat NSPCs are cultured on 102 distinct hydrogels fabricated with varying parameters, and their attachment conditions and cell viability are evaluated. To mitigate overfitting issue, 10–20 times more virtual data points are generated from characterized NSPC attachment and viability data. A support vector machine classifier is trained on attachment data to define a feasible parameter space where NSPCs consistently adhere to biointerfaces. Subsequently, a prediction model is constructed to predict rat NSPC viability. Model interpretation reveals that biointerface stiffness is the primary factor for rat NSPC attachment and viability, with peptide loading also contributing. Leveraging these insights, the stiffness of a nerve‐on‐a‐chip platform is optimized by adjusting the bilayer number of a polyelectrolyte multilayer, successfully enhancing neurite outgrowth. This versatile ML workflow can be extended to other bioengineering systems.",

However, the widespread adoption of Zn‐I2 in demanding energy applications necessitates overcoming challenges such as the instability of Zn anode surface electrochemistry and polyiodide shuttling effect. As an innovative proof‐of‐concept, the modulation of ion transport behavior is proposed through the delicate modification of the Zn‐I2 battery electrolyte environment using amyloid fibrils (AFs) derived from milk proteins. The incorporation of AFs effectively regulated the nucleation and growth behavior of Zn ions and stabilized the local pH fluctuations during the reaction process, thereby inhibiting the side reactions such as hydrogen evolution and byproduct formation. Furthermore, the 3D physicochemical double cross‐linked network of AFs mitigated the shuttling effect of polyiodide ions and enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of the I2 cathode. The modified electrolytes exhibit a remarkable capacity decay rate of 1.17% after exceeding 30 000 cycles at 5 A·g−1, coupled with superior anti‐self‐discharge performance over 500 h. The work introduces a novel strategy for regulating coordinated cation and ion transport through meticulous electrolyte design and expands the potential engineering applications of protein‐based materials for enhancing the performance of Zn‐I2 batteries.",

Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) offer a promising approach for building‐integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) by harvesting and guiding sunlight to photovoltaic cells. While perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are highly efficient luminophores for LSCs, their instability in polymeric and liquid matrices hinders real‐world deployment. Glass nanocomposites (GNCs) provide a durable alternative, yet scalability and efficiency trade‐offs remain underexplored. This study investigates CsPbBr3 PQD GNC LSCs across various sizes, addressing this gap. Standardized 2.5 mm‐thick samples with surface areas from 1 × 1 to 5 × 5 cm2 are fabricated and Monte Carlo simulations extend predictions up to 1 m2. A record‐high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 97% is achieved for a reference sample, highlighting exceptional emission efficiency. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.17% is recorded for small‐scale devices, declining to 0.38% at 5 × 5 cm2. Simulations predict retention of 0.30% for 1 m2 LSCs, demonstrating scalability. Efficiency losses plateau beyond a critical size, enabling upscaling without major performance degradation.

However, defects in polycrystalline films, such as point/interfacial defects and grain boundaries, create pathways for moisture and ion diffusion, thereby compromising device performance and stability. Herein, the capillary epitaxy growth of CsCu2I3 single‐crystal films (SCFs) is demonstrated with a bandgap of 3.68 eV on GaN, by leveraging capillary forces to guide the transport of the molten precursor and using lattice‐matching substrates to achieve crystallographic alignments. This strategy suppresses random nucleation and produces CsCu2I3 SCFs with high crystallinity (rocking curve FWHM = 0.286°). The critical role of lattice matching is further underscored by contrasting the polycrystalline CsCu2I3 or Cs3Cu2I5 films grown on lattice‐mismatched substrates, as well as by the impressive open‐circuit voltage of 1.08 V achieved in the CsCu2I3 SCF/GaN heterojunction. The CsCu2I3 SCF/GaN ultraviolet photodetectors demonstrate nW‐level detection limit (≈2.81 nW) and self‐powered operation, combining the 24 nm narrowband bandwidth with dual‐mode (voltage/current) signal outputs for interference‐resistant detection and communication.

For seamless integration with silicon solar cells, materials with the lowest excited singlet and triplet energies near 2.2 and 1.1 eV, respectively, are crucial. Among various SF candidates, tetracene derivatives have garnered significant attention due to their ability to sensitize silicon layers and their distinct spectroscopic properties. However, their limited chemical stability and challenges in modulating chromophore stacking and electronic interactions hinder practical applications. In this study, 5,11‐di(thiophen‐2‐yl)tetracene (2T‐Tc) is synthesized as a novel approach to overcome these limitations. This tetracene derivative with staggered thienyl substituents exhibits markedly improved chemical durability and phase stability in thin films while maintaining favorable SF kinetics and high triplet pair yields. Unlike rubrene or other tetracene derivatives, 2T‐Tc readily forms stable polycrystalline thin films with enhanced interchromophore interactions, owing to its intrinsically planar tetracene core. Notably, it eliminates the need for additional post‐processing to optimize photophysical properties.

To overcome this predicament, a dual strategy integrating composition modulation and texture engineering is proposed with the purpose of restructuring the complex coupling between the phase structure, domain configuration, crystal anisotropy, and phase transition of (K,Na)NbO3‐based ceramics. As a result, a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33 ∼ 550 ± 30 pC N−1), and an inverse piezoelectric coefficient (d33* ∼ 850 pm V−1), as well as a Curie temperature TC of 290 °C, are obtained in (K,Na)NbO3‐based textured ceramics. Most importantly, in the temperature range of 25–200 °C, the maximum permitted fluctuations of d33 and d33* of the (K,Na)NbO3‐based ceramics are only 3% and 4%, respectively. This ultra‐stable thermal piezoelectricity displayed in (K,Na)NbO3‐based ceramics is comparable to that of commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3‐based ceramics. This work not only enhances the potential of (K,Na)NbO3‐based ceramics to replace Pb(Zr,Ti)O3‐based ceramics in high‐temperature service, but also offers critical insights into the rational design of lead‐free piezoelectric ceramics for broad‐temperature‐range applications.",

Three precursors—co‐precipitated hydroxides, micrometer‐sized metal oxides (MO), and nanometer‐sized oxides (sand‐milled metal oxides, SMMO)—are compared, alongside sodium sources (Na2CO3, NaOH, NaHCO3). Hydroxide precursors enabled a direct P3‐to‐O3 solid‐solution transition via homogeneous Na‐ion diffusion, yielding uniform structures and superior electrochemical performance (131 mAh g−1 discharge capacity). In contrast, MO precursors exhibited stepwise phase evolution: Mn2O3 initiated P3 formation at 425 °C, Fe2O3 promoted O3 nucleation at 675 °C, and NiO finalized the transition at 800 °C, albeit with residual impurities. Reducing precursor size (SMMO) delayed phase onset temperatures but retained diffusion‐controlled pathways. Sodium source decomposition kinetics critically influenced phase transitions: NaOH accelerated O3 formation at lower temperatures, while NaHCO3 delayed P3‐O3 conversion. STXM revealed heterogeneous oxidation states in oxide‐derived samples, correlating with sluggish diffusion and inferior cycling stability. This work establishes that precursor uniformity and sodium source selection govern diffusion homogeneity, phase purity, and electrochemical behavior.",

This modification replaces the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the iodine oxidation reaction (IOR), which operates at a significantly reduced overpotential. Second, FePc@CoSAs/NC catalyst is constructed by anchoring iron phthalocyanine (FePc) on Co single‐atom/N‐doped carbon substrates.

The optimized ZAIHBs demonstrate exceptional energy efficiency of 75% and cycling stability (73.5% retention over 350 h), surpassing conventional ZABs. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Co–Fe dual‐site coordination optimizes adsorption energetics for critical reaction intermediates (OH* in ORR and I* in IOR), elucidating the enhanced reaction kinetics.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored electronic structures is crucial for enhancing photocatalytic performances and offers an alternative pathway for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. In this study, the construction of customized COFs featuring in‐plane and intramolecular asymmetric polarization is reported to boost charge separation and redox reactivity. By integrating electron donor and electron acceptor units in the COF skeleton with precise spatial arrangement, an in‐plane and intramolecular polarized electronic environment is achieved that facilitates directional charge transport. The optimized COF with asymmetric electronic distribution exhibits outstanding activity for H2O2 photosynthesis under visible light, achieving a high yield of 4524 µmol g−1 h−1 in pure water and air without sacrificial agents, demonstrating high productivity and excellent stability. The photocatalytic efficiency further increases to 7316 µmol g−1 h−1 at pH 3, demonstrating excellent pH‐responsive behavior. Beyond H2O2 synthesis, the optimized COF simultaneously catalyzes value‐added alcohol oxidation reactions, showcasing its multifunctional catalytic capabilities. This work establishes asymmetric polarization engineering as a powerful design principle for COF photocatalysts, providing both fundamental insights into charge separation mechanisms and practical guidelines for developing sustainable photocatalytic systems. The exceptional performance of BT‐COF highlights the vast potential of structurally engineered COFs for solar‐driven chemical transformations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBone adhesives capable of replacing traditional invasive materials represent a revolutionary advancement in orthopedic surgery. However, the efficiency of commercial bone adhesives is often limited due to their inability to promote the ingrowth of bone‐related cells, a crucial process for the effective integration of fractured bone and the implant. The strategy of in situ pore formation, coupled with intrinsic microenvironment remodeling, has shown promise in enhancing bone fracture healing. Herein, inspired by the natural process of coral skeleton formation, a novel bone adhesive is designed by composing bioactive glass (BG) uniformly dispersed within a bioactive organic template of poly(lipoic acid) (PolyLA). Upon contact with body fluids, BG undergoes mineralization to form hydroxyapatite, while its weak alkalinity partially dissociates the surrounding PolyLA, forming a continuous pore structure. This porosity promotes the ingrowth and adhesion of bone cells, facilitating bone integration. Additionally, the in situ release of LA‐based active molecules modulates the adverse microenvironments at the fracture site and enhances osteogenic regeneration by activating MAPK and calcium ion signaling pathways. Notably, the adhesive demonstrated robust instant bonding to bone and promoted efficient bone regeneration in a rabbit radius fracture model. This work introduces an innovative approach for developing bioactive bone adhesives with enhanced capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Cathode active material is the most valuable component of spent lithium‐ion batteries, accounting for ≈30% of their overall value. Direct recycling of cathode materials involves recovering, regenerating, and reusing them without breaking down their chemical structure. This approach maximizes the added value of the cathode compound and reduces manufacturing costs by avoiding the need for virgin material production. However, one key challenge in scaling direct recycling from lab to industry is the requirement for highly purified cathode materials, contrasting with the low purity of black mass generated from battery shredding. No efficient separation process currently exists to isolate different lithium‐nickel‐manganese‐cobalt oxides (NMCs) from each other. Thus, direct recycling technologies that can operate with mixtures of multiple NMC stoichiometries will be best‐suited for industrial adoption. This study explores the direct recycling of NMC mixtures into NMC 622 using a “reciprocal ternary molten salts (RTMS)” system. Ionothermal relithiation and upcycling within the RTMS system successfully restore the layered structure, lithium content, and electrochemical performance of degraded NMCs, yielding results comparable to pristine NMC 622 (P‐NMC 622).",

The prepared NPs were found to be polycrystalline, polydispersed, and sphere‐shaped, showing average sizes of 47 nm for IO NPs and 49 nm for ZnO NPs. Both types of NPs revealed robust antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. IO NPs exhibited superior antioxidant activity (61.63% at 150 µg/mL) and brine shrimp lethality (LC50 of 162.13 µg/mL) compared to ZnO NPs. In a similar pattern, the IO NPs exhibited low hemolysis and proved to be compatible with human RBCs. Zeta potential measurements indicated mild stability and poor flocculation, with values of −24.6 mV for IO NPs, while ZnO NPs depicted moderate stability with a value of +21.6 mV. Similarly, IO NPs exhibited superior antineoplastic activity than ZnO NPs against HT29 cells (IC50 of 82.98 µg/mL) and presented better efficacy against HepG2 cells (IC50 of 49.09 µg/mL). Flow cytometry indicates that IO NPs induced higher early and late apoptotic rates in cancer cells. So, it can be inferred that IO NPs synthesized from A. sativum disclosed superior biocompatibility for its use as an antineoplastic drug with reduced cost.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the growing challenges of global energy demand and environmental protection, hydrogen production has emerged as a key research focus. A robust Ni/ZrO2 catalyst has demonstrated favorable catalytic activity and stability for hydrogen production via ammonia decomposition and dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactions at relatively low reaction temperatures. The reduced Ni/ZrO2 catalyst showed a mean ammonia conversion value of 72.9% at 600 °C and could be kept for over 60‐h for ammonia decomposition reaction with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 20,000 mL·g−1·h−1. In addition, the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited a mean CO2 conversion value of 85.1%, and H2/CO ratio of 1.05 at 800 °C, and could be kept for 75‐h for DRM reaction with a GHSV of 68,000 mL·g−1·h−1. Structural characterization revealed that the phase transformation of ZrO2 from cubic to monoclinic contributed to the enhanced catalyst stability. Additionally, the mesoporous structure facilitated mass transfer, while the strong metal‐support interactions suppressed Ni sintering. Notably, active carbon whiskers formed during DRM further stabilized the catalyst. These findings highlight the role of metal‐support interactions and structural evolution in enhancing the catalytic performance and long‐term stability of Ni/ZrO2, making it a promising candidate for high‐temperature catalytic applications.",

Electronic absorption studies confirmed strong DNA‐binding interactions for 2c and 2d, indicating significant hypochromic effects with increasing DNA concentration. The binding constants (Kb) were determined as 1.37 × 106 M−1 and 3.65 × 106 M−1, respectively comparable to classical DNA intercalators, while Gibbs free energy values (−35.03 and −37.44 kJ/mol) respectively, indicated a spontaneous and stable binding process. Computational target prediction of these compounds suggested potent kinase inhibition, particularly against receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR & ALK) and their downstream pathways (PI3K & mTOR). Molecular docking demonstrated notable kinase inhibition with 2g displaying a docking score of −8.3 kcal/mol against EGFR comparable to standard erlotinib (−8.5 kcal/mol), and 2d surpassing erlotinib (−7.9 kcal/mol) in ALK inhibition (−9.0 kcal/mol). Similarly, compound 2c exhibited dual‐target inhibition of PI3K and mTOR (−9.0 and −9.5 kcal/mol) respectively, with molecular dynamics simulations confirming stability. DFT analysis correlated electronic properties with kinase selectivity, while in silico cytotoxicity models indicated superior tumor cell selectivity. Additionally, ADMET analysis predicted favorable pharmacokinetics and minimal toxicity, highlighting the potential of these s‐triazine derivatives for targeted anticancer therapy.",

The main objective of this research is, for the first time, to characterize the volatile compounds and evaluate the antioxidant, antienzymatic, antibacterial, and anticandidal properties of Teucrium gypsophilum essential oils (TGEO). Using the GC–MS–MS technique, the analysis identified β‐pinene (28. 6%), diethyl phthalate (20.70%), spathulenol (10.49%), ledol (6.92%), germacrene D (6.04%), α‐pinene (5.8%), and d‐limonene (4.26%) as the major components. Antioxidant activity was assessed using six different methods, including in 2,2′‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2‐ azino‐bis‐3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric ion reducing activity (CUPRAC), ferrous chelating, and phosphomolybdenum models, showing significant capacity of TGEO to reduce Cuprac, ABTS, FRAP, phosphomolybdenum, and DPPH radicals, with results of 106 ± 7.55 mg TE/g, 70.36 ± 0.11 mg TE/g, 63.53 ± 2.50 mg TE/g, 25.58 ± 0.59 mmol TE/g, and 10.21 ± 0.66 mg TE/g, respectively. Furthermore, TGEO exhibited promising inhibitory activity against tyrosinase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and α‐amylase, with values of 13.23 ± 2.80 mg KAE/g, 6.75 ± 0.24 mg GALAE/g, 2.30 ± 0.02 mg GALAE/g, and 1.38 ± 0.07 mmol ACAE/g, respectively. The antibacterial and anticandidal activities of TGEO were also demonstrated, with inhibition zones ranging from 17 mm to 40 mm. These findings suggest that TGEO is a potential source of natural antioxidants, and exhibits antibacterial, anticandidal, and antienzymatic properties, making it a promising candidate for use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe bacterial cell envelope is a complex structure that acts as a barrier to many small molecules, surfactants, and antibiotics. Microscopic understanding of how these molecules interact with the bacterial cell envelope is crucial for the development of new antimicrobials and antibiotics. Advanced microscopy techniques, such as confocal and super‐resolution microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electron microscopy (EM), enable high‐resolution examination of membrane packing, pore formation, membrane dynamics, and related mechanisms, both before and after antimicrobial treatment. These methods provide valuable insights into the morphological and dynamical alternations of bacterial cell envelopes during the interaction with antimicrobials/antibiotics. In this review, we highlight findings from various studies utilizing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), EM, and AFM to investigate bacterial membrane interactions with antimicrobial molecules. We investigate potential pathways through which antimicrobial molecules disrupt the bacterial cell envelope, using lipid diffusivity as a marker. Using AFM, the morphological and dynamical changes in the bacterial membrane were investigated, uncovering structural alterations induced by antimicrobial exposure, including variations in topography, roughness, and other key features. Taken together, these findings illustrate how microscopy‐based techniques have evolved into powerful tools for unraveling molecular membrane interactions, offering significant potential to guide the development of novel antimicrobials and more effective strategies for treating bacterial infections.",

This research explores the application of this material as a photocatalyst. The kinetic parameters of methylene blue (MB) removal by Sr₂FeO₄ were evaluated using linear models, including pseudo‐first‐order (PFO), pseudo‐second‐order (PSO), and intra‐particle diffusion. Four error functions‐correlation coefficient (R2), root‐mean‐square error (RMSE), mean‐square error (MSE), and sum of squares error (SSE) were applied to determine the best kinetic fit. The MB removal mechanism was studied and found to follow intra‐particle diffusion kinetics. The effect of various parameters (pH, catalyst mass, irradiation time, etc.) on the removal efficiency of MB was also investigated, and the pHpzc point was evaluated. These results highlight Sr₂FeO₄ as an efficient and inexpensive photocatalyst for the decomposition of pollutants in water under visible light irradiation.",

In this study, we report the structure‐based design and biological evaluation of a series of benzoxazole derivatives as potential mTOR inhibitors. Cytotoxicity studies using MTT assays showed that compounds B4, B11, B12, and B20 exhibited significant antiproliferative effects against breast cancer cell lines with IC₅₀ values between 4.96 and 9.82 µM. Colorimetric enzymatic assays further revealed that among these, only B12 and B20 effectively inhibited mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 in MCF‐7 cells. Additionally, both compounds modulated the expression of key apoptotic proteins, including Bax, caspase‐3, p53, and Bcl2. Molecular docking studies against the 4JT5 protein demonstrated binding affinities with docking scores ranging from −7.084 to −7.426 kcal/mol, comparable to the reference compound P2X (−7.309 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations over 150 ns confirmed the stability of B12 and B20 in the active site, with an average RMSD of 2.8 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the synthesized compounds were evaluated in silico. Among them, B4, B11, B12, and B20 exhibited drug‐like characteristics and showed no undesirable toxic effects. These findings highlight the potential of B12 and B20 as lead compounds for the development of novel mTOR inhibitors in breast cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe effect of coordination interactions on the electrophysical properties of segmented polyurethanes (SPU) is studied. For the coordination binding of SPU, the products of CuCl2 and N,N'‐diethylhydroxylamine (DEHA) interaction were used. The lowest values of the bulk electrical resistivity (ρv) for metal‐coordinated segmented polyurethanes (MSPU) modified by the CuCl2–DEHA system are achieved already at a very low of CuCl2 content, which is in the range of 0.1–0.5 wt %. The change in ρv is abrupt, and the ρv values themselves increase by 1000–5000 times. The obtained results are of great practical importance since they allow to achieve the ability of such polyurethanes to effectively remove static electricity from their surface. The coordination binding with the use of low CuCl2–DEHA content leads to an increase in the temperature of transition into the viscous flow state from 160 °C for unmodified SPU to 185 °C for MSPU containing 0.1 wt % of CuCl2 introduced in the CuCl2–DEHA system. It is suggested that macromolecules are attracted due to dipole‐dipole interactions to the corresponding charge of metal complexes. The interactions as a result of the cooperative effect lead to the orientation and self‐organization of macromolecules relative to each other.",

The polymer solution filled the AAO pores via capillary action, and after solvent evaporation, the AAO was etched away to reveal the nanofiber membrane. For pH sensitivity, polystyrene (PS) nanofiber membranes were coated with 2‐(11‐mercaptoundecanamido) benzoic acid (MUABA), whose thiol groups remain protonated in acidic environments but deprotonate in alkaline conditions, significantly altering the contact angle. Temperature sensitivity was achieved by coating poly (N‐isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) onto the PS membrane. Above PNIPAAm's lower critical solution temperature (LCST), the contact angle sharply increases as the amide groups form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, creating hydrophobicity, while below LCST, they bind with water, leading to hydrophilicity. This study provides a simpler, more convenient, and cost‐effective method for producing functional, responsive nanofibrillated membranes.",

PL study of the NS illustrates that the emission property is responsible for the many‐body interaction of excitons at the Nb impurity introduced bound and resonant defect states near valence band of WS2 and sub‐gap sulfur vacancy defect states. The NS exhibited type I band alignment between WS2/WO3, which is crucial for optoelectronic photodetector devices. The reported synthesis strategy provides a cost‐effective way of producing tunable and stable WS2/WO3 NS with enhanced emission properties, opening an avenue for designing electronic and optoelectronic devices and other functional applications.",

The double bond position distinguishes the two pyran isomers, namely, 2H‐pyran and 4H‐pyran. When a saturated sp3 carbon is located next to an oxygen atom, it is known as 2H‐pyran, and when it is at the 4‐position with respect to oxygen is known as 4H‐pyran. In 1962, by the thermal breakdown of 2‐acetoxy‐3,4‐dihydro‐2H‐pyran, 4H‐pyrans were produced for the first time, and their characteristics were explored. Numerous synthetic methods of pyran have been disclosed over time owing to their broad applications in diverse fields, mainly in drug design, pharmaceuticals, and material science. In this review, we highlight the recent advancements toward substituted 4H‐pyran, 2H‐pyran, 4‐pyranone, and 2‐pyranones, focusing on reports published from 2019 to till date, which play important roles in both organic synthesis and diverse types of functional molecules.",

The flocculation performance of TP‐AM was evaluated by the flocculation of common microplastics and heavy metal, and the results disclosed that superior flocculation performances can be achieved on PVC and Pb2+. The different flocculation conditions on the flocculation were investigated for either the single component or the mixture of PVC/Pb2+. The results indicate that, in a solution of pH 6 at 30 °C, a maximum removal percentage of 91.22% was obtained for PVC by 80 mg L−1 of TP‐AM versus 93.45% for Pb2+ by 5 g L−1 of TP‐AM, while for a mixture of PVC/Pb2+, the maximum removal percentages were improved to 91.89% and 95.14% with an optimized usage of 550 mg L TP‐AM. Zeta potential measurement and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy were applied to investigate the flocculation mechanism, which indicted that TP‐AM exerts an influence of adsorption electric neutralization besides bridging with PVC and a chelation with Pb2+.

The motivation behind this study stems from the growing demand for efficient and eco‐friendly materials to remove organic dyes from aqueous environments. Traditional biomass raw materials, such as coconut shells, walnut shells, pomelo peels, and wheat straw, are often characterized by highly demanding acquisition conditions and high costs of procurement, which consequently limit their availability. In contrast, CSS‐BC, derived from abundant camphor seed shells, offers a low‐cost alternative. Moreover, the introduction of g‐C3N4 can effectively enhance the removal capacity of methylene blue(MB) from aqueous solutions by the composite material. By integrating these two materials, we aim to address the limitations of existing adsorbents and develop a more effective and environmentally friendly solution. The material was subjected to a thorough characterization employing X‐ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption efficacy of CSS‐BC/g‐C3N4 toward MB was systematically assessed under a variety of conditions, including different ratios, pH levels, contact times, and initial MB concentrations, resulting in a maximum adsorption capacity of 290.012 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics of the material were found to align well with the pseudo‐second‐order model, and the adsorption isotherm data were well described by the Langmuir model, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.910. This research presents an efficient material for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous environments and offers innovative insights into the development of eco‐friendly materials.",

The parent compound ROM, featuring a dimethylamino donor (D) and methanesulfonyl acceptor (A), exhibited typical ACQ behavior. Remarkably, relocating the D unit to generate M‐ROM or exchanging D‐A positions to form S‐ROM resulted in distinct AIE characteristics. Single‐crystal X‐ray analysis revealed that J‐aggregation modes and enhanced intermolecular interactions (C─H···π and C─H···O) in M‐ROM and S‐ROM restrict intramolecular motion, suppressing non‐radiative decay. All three compounds demonstrated solvatochromism and reversible acidochromism, with S‐ROM exhibiting ultrasensitive water detection in THF (LoD: 0.0106%) and rewritable security ink functionality via acid/base‐triggered emission switching. Furthermore, S‐ROM showed exceptional lipid droplet imaging specificity in live cells (Pearson's coefficient: 0.98), supported by low cytotoxicity.

The oxidation of 1‐(4‐chlorophenyl)‐pyrazolidin‐3‐one to 1‐(4‐chlorophenyl)‐1H‐pyrazol‐3‐ol can be realized by air catalyzed with Co(II)@AC (prepared by supporting cobalt(II) on activated carbon). Air is a good substitute for H2O2 because it can minimize the cost, hazards, and pollution, which is beneficial to the improvement of the production process for pyraclostrobin. In this study, activated carbon has been modified by H2C2O4 solution to improve the catalytic performance of Co(II)@AC. The experiments indicate that the best carbon is made by heating the carbon at 300 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in N2 after being soaked in 0.4 mol/L H2C2O4 solution at 50 °C for 12 h with an L/S ratio of 40/1 mL/g.

Characterization results reveal that modification with H2C2O4 increases the specific surface area and enhances the acidity on the carbon surface. The oxidation rate of 1‐(4‐chlorophenyl)‐pyrazolidin‐3‐one is primarily determined by the physical structure.

The evaluation was performed using weight loss measurements, electrochemical techniques, and surface characterization methods. Potentiodynamic polarization tests revealed that RHA functions as a mixed‐type inhibitor. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests showed that increasing the extract concentration leads to higher charge transfer resistance and lower double‐layer capacitance. The adsorption of the inhibitor onto the steel surface followed the Langmuir isotherm model, and surface characterization confirmed the formation of a protective RHA layer. The results demonstrate that RHA is an effective corrosion inhibitor, achieving a maximum inhibition efficiency of 92% at a concentration of 1.2 g/L.",

The results indicated that, when TEPP and TEOPP were added at a concentration of 5 wt%, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) values of EP/TEPP and EP/TEOPP were 35.6% and 32.6%, respectively, with the former achieving a UL‐94 V0 rating. Cone calorimeter tests demonstrated that EP/TEOPP outperformed EP/TEPP in reducing heat and smoke release, suggesting distinct flame‐retardant mechanisms: TEPP primarily acts in the gas phase via the release of phosphorus‐containing radicals, while TEOPP promotes char formation in the condensed phase. Both systems also demonstrated good mechanical performance, owing to the hydroxyl groups and branched structures in the flame retardant molecules. This work provides valuable insight into the structure–property relationships of phosphorus–nitrogen oligomers and offers a strategy for designing high‐performance flame‐retardant epoxy systems.",

The resulting materials were fully characterized and evaluated their catalytic and selectivity performance in the oxidation of thioanisole with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant under mild reaction conditions. Doping of zirconia oxide with lanthanum improves the selectivity toward sulfone in the oxidation of thioanisole (71.9% selectivity, 5LaZr catalyst vs. 51.3% selectivity, Zr), due to modifications in the surface acid–base properties of zirconia, among other changes. From XRD profiles, the relative crystallinity of these solids decreases as the lanthanum doping increases. This favors oxygen mobility, which is a desirable feature for oxidation reactions. In addition, the presence of carbonate species for 5LaZr also participates, favoring the sulfone selectivity. Reaction parameters such as lanthanum content, nature of solvents, catalyst amount, temperature, oxidant amount, and reuses were evaluated.",

The result of this investigation clearly established that the bio‐fabricated Cr2O3 NPs efficiently remove the pollutants from the aqueous solution.

All interactions were verified and energetically classified by density functional theory (DFT) and their contribution at each contact point was analyzed using QTAIM theory. Weak interactions, such as C‐H···X, C‐H···C e C···X, perform a key role in stabilizing the crystal packing due to the larger contact area of these fragments and their higher occurrence, compared to strong interactions such as O‐H···O. The crystallization mechanisms were proposed based on the model developed by our research group. The mechanism starts with the strongest interaction (π···π) present in the first coordination sphere, which forms the first one‐dimensional (1D) supramolecular chain. From this chain, hypotheses of approximation between these chains were analyzed to determine the most stable arrangement for the formation of the supramolecular layer two‐dimensional (2D). The process continues until the formation of a supramolecular structure (3D) with growth in its three directions through interactions X···X via σ‐hole. The compounds in the ortho and para positions demonstrated isostructuralism in the equivalent positions, even with the variation of the halogen (Chlorine and Bromine), which had distinct mechanisms.",

This optimization led for both near‐infrared‐emitting dyes to a substantial increase of the photoluminescence quantum yield, which can reach values as high as 60%. It is also found that the blend films show excellent ASE properties with a threshold as low as 3.5–4.5 μJ cm−2 for peak wavelengths of 739 and 727 nm. In addition, the electroluminescence properties of the two organic laser dyes are examined in organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best OLED device shows a maximum external quantum efficiency value of around 2%.

AI has demonstrated its ability to predict these phenomena accurately while uncovering structure–property relationships that can remain hidden under traditional methods.

The kind of promoter had no significant influence on the thermal transition of iron oxalate into the magnetite (Fe3O4) phase as the major phase under inert gas. In contrast, the promoters did have a substantial impact on the phase composition during CO2 hydrogenation. The Raman spectroscopic results obtained, underpinned with X‐ray diffraction measurements, demonstrated a much stronger development of carbon‐containing species, notably iron carbides (FeCx) and carbon deposits, when using the alkali metal‐promoted catalysts. The formation of carbon deposits may indirectly indicate the occurrence of carbidization, however, no quantitative correlation was discovered.

At TA conversion >99%, SA yield of 76% is obtained. TA concentrations as high as 10 wt.% could be employed, and unprecedentedly high turnover number (TON, 144) and SA productivity (0.24 gSA·gcatalyst−1·h−1) are obtained.

Though many advancements have demonstrated a considerable yield of valuable liquid chemicals, including methanol (CH3OH), formic acid (HCOOH), and formaldehyde (HCHO), selective generation of a single product is still unsatisfactory. In this work, we propose a highly efficient strategy, based on the precise control of the type of as‐formed reactive oxygen species (ROS) by rational design of photocatalysts, to achieve both high selectivity and high productivity of CH3OH and CH3OOH in CH4 photooxidation. By virtue of the suitable valence band position of In2O3 support, which is above the oxidation potential of H2O to ·OH but below that of CH4 into ·CH3, the left holes on the valence band specifically convert CH4 into ·CH3. Meanwhile, the transferred electrons could reduce the adsorbed O2 on Pt single atoms or Pt nanoparticles, leading to the selective formation of ·OOH and ·OH, respectively, which directly determines the selectivity of products. As a result, the formation rate of liquid oxygenates is 2966.98 µmol·gcat−1·h−1 over Pt0.08/In2O3 with CH3OOH as the main product at a selectivity of 87.5%. Over Pt2.3/In2O3, and CH3OH was the primary product with the formation rate and selectivity of 2885.5 µmol·gcat−1·h−1 and 88.3%, respectively.",

The challenge in this process is enhancing catalytic performance by optimizing the intimacy between metal and Brønsted acid sites in bifunctional catalysts. In this study, a series of bifunctional catalysts with varying metal–acid site intimacy was prepared by depositing platinum (Pt) on the ZSM‐23 zeolite or γ‐Al2O3 surface. The Pt/A + Z catalyst, exhibiting moderate intimacy, demonstrated superior catalytic performance in the hydroisomerization of n‐hexadecane, achieving up to 64 ± 0.8% i‐C16 yield at 89 ± 0.5% conversion. The optimized metal–acid site intimacy facilitated the desorption of reaction intermediates, minimizing cracking at the acid sites and thus improving selectivity. Further analysis revealed that product distributions were closely related to the pore structure of zeolites. Specifically, the formation of di‐branched isomers during the isomerization of n‐hexadecane, n‐dodecane, and n‐octane was influenced by the type of zeolite support (ZSM‐23, ZSM‐48). The present study proposes a direct method to enhance the hydroisomerization performance while reducing the cost of the catalyst. By determining di‐branched products more precisely, it introduces a novel approach for evaluating products based on branch chain spacing.

Additionally, signals related to the formation of monoethyl carbonate intermediate were also identified in the IR spectra collected during exposure of ethanol‐saturated ceria to CO2. High‐resolution TEM analysis revealed that the rod‐shaped morphology exhibits a greater abundance of surface defects, such as nanovoids and surface steps, compared to the cube and nanoparticle ones, responsible for the highest activity of the rod ceria catalyst. The rod‐shaped catalyst retained high performance over four sequential regeneration and reuse cycles, demonstrating its stability and reusability.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this study, an iridium catalyst (Ir/Ni10Ce) was used for the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB). The parameters tested were temperature, stirring rate, AB concentration, and AB‐to‐catalyst molar ratio. By integrating a simple Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, the experimental results were validated with a maximum error of 13% observed at only two experimental conditions, while on the rest it was lower than 10%, showcasing the robustness of the model. In all experimental cases, AB resulted in over 85% H2 yield. Statistical analysis was also implemented to uncover the effect of the four main factors: temperature, stirring rate, AB concentration, and substrate (AB) to catalyst ratio, on the three response variables: reaction time, TOF, and H2 yield. Radar plots are also presented, illustrating how two‐factor interaction influences the response variables. By combining temperature with either concentration or catalyst amount, a profound effect on the reaction time was observed. The combination of experimental work along with computational work of CFD and statistical analysis can significantly enhance a reaction process by targeting the most impactful factors, allowing experiments with optimized reaction conditions for better results in terms of H2 yield and catalytic performance. Considering also the interaction of the variables enables further process optimization by focusing on specific parameter combinations without wasting resources.",

    "abstract": "AbstractQuantum dot (QD)‐based photocatalysts show promise for H2 production due to their unique properties. To mitigate the disadvantages caused by surface defects, core/shell engineering is typically used for surface passivation. However, in conventional Type‐I and Type‐II heterostructure QDs, the valence band (VB) of the shell is more positive than that of the core, creating the thermodynamic barrier for holes migration from core to shell, leading to further deterioration of the rate‐determining step in the photocatalytic systems. Herein, the reverse Type‐II core/shell QDs of InP/CdS are synthesized by epitaxially growing the CdS shell on the InP QDs. The CdS shell coverage would not only effectively passivate the surface defects of InP QDs, but also forms a reverse Type‐II heterojunction which the VB of CdS shell is more negative than that of InP core. This band alignment generates a thermodynamic driving force for directional hole migration to the CdS surface, thereby accelerating the rate‐limiting hole transfer process. Under optimal conditions, the InP/CdS QDs exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and stability, which the H2 evolution rate could reach 63.43 ± 5.1 µmol mg−1 h−1 during the initial 40 h reaction, giving the turnover number (TON) value of 376,840 per QD under 60 h irradiation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDesigning highly efficient electrocatalysts for various chemical reactions is an important research area in advanced science and technology. The electrocatalyst is essential for the H2 evolution reaction (HER) in order to efficiently lower the reaction energy barriers and produce hydrogen. To date, platinum (Pt)‐based catalysts have shown the best performance toward HER due to the optimum hydrogen adsorption energy. However, the expensive, low abundance, and scarcity of Pt‐based catalysts limit their commercialization. Therefore, it is necessary to find out precious Pt‐free electrocatalysts with low potential reaction barriers. 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have proven to be suitable electrocatalysts for HER. In the present study, we deployed the hybrid DFT method to compute the electrocatalytic performance and evaluate the electronic properties of the 2D monolayer Nb‐MoSe2 material for H2 evolution. To investigate the electrocatalysis of the subject material, we have computationally designed a nonperiodic molecular cluster model system Nb1Mo9Se21 which illustrates both the Mo‐/Nb‐edges (100) and Se‐edges (010) of the 2D monolayer Nb‐MoSe2. The reaction barriers for H*‐migration, Heyrovsky, and Tafel transition states (TSs) are 20.63 kcal mol−1, 6.64 kcal mol−1, and 8.91 kcal mol−1, respectively, computed by using the polarizable continuum (PCM) solvation method. The present research demonstrates that the 2D monolayer Nb‐MoSe2 follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism during the HER. The low reaction barrier, high turnover frequency (TOF), and low Tafel slope during the hydrogen formation confirm that the 2D monolayer Nb‐MoSe2 proves to be a good electrocatalyst for the HER.",

In the presence of La─Ce─O and doped with 5 wt% Na2WO4 catalysts, the reaction starts at 450 °C while the catalysts with 10 and 15 wt% Na2WO4 are inactive below 600 °C. Moreover, doping with Na2WO4 improves the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons (ethane and ethylene). Over the catalysts with 15 wt% Na2WO4 content 65% selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons with a methane conversion of 25% were obtained at 650 °C (CH4/O2 = 3.8). Changes in the catalytic properties of the Na2WO4 doped La─Ce─O catalysts are accompanied by significant changes in their physicochemical properties. It has been proposed that the modification of the chemical and phase composition and blocking the strong basic sites are primarily responsible for improving the selectivity, while the activity is also influenced by the reduction of the surface area and increase in the particle size caused by the Na2WO4 doping.",

An N‐doped carbon nanotube containing CoW alloy was synthesized by pyrolysis of metatungstate@ZIF‐67 and melamine precursor. Thus, the synthesized CoW‐N/C catalyst shows the E10 values of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions as 1.6 V and −0.24 V vs RHE, respectively. It is analyzed for water‐splitting performance and exhibits a cell potential of 1.79 V at 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable with Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts combination. The water electrolysis was performed using a chronopotentiometric experiment at 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h. Besides, the catalyst shows the oxygen reduction activity with the Eonset of 0.93 V vs RHE and was analyzed for its performance in the zinc‐air battery. Interestingly, the catalysts yield the maximum power density of 111.3 mW cm−2, which is better than the benchmark catalysts (Pt/C + RuO2). Thus, the CoW‐containing N‐doped carbon catalysts behave as trifunctional. This study highlights the multifunctional activity of CoW alloy catalysts across diverse electrochemical reactions, emphasizing their promising applications in energy storage devices and electrolyzers.",

While hydrazine oxidation has been extensively researched in aqueous environments, it remains less explored in organic solvents, and it gains importance because of the recent advancement of ammonia oxidation in nonaqueous media. This study investigates the oxidation of hydrazine in acetonitrile using decamethylferrocene (Fc''), a stable, electron‐donating ferrocene derivative. The research focused on reaction kinetics, revealing a first‐order dependence on the concentrations of both Fc’’ and hydrazine. Additionally, the impact of pyridine‐derived bases on HzOR was examined. Mechanistic insights were developed, and temperature‐dependent studies indicated a 4.79 kJ/mol activation barrier for the mediated HzOR. The overpotential for HzOR under the given conditions is found to be 829 mV, which was determined through open‐circuit potential (OCP) measurements. Quantitative analyses of the gaseous products were performed, which revealed quantitative hydrogen production. This study significantly adds to the existing literature on HzOR by providing crucial data on its behavior in an organic medium.",

Gold Teaching and learning methods Undergraduates We can all remember back to our first forays into research. It was a process filled with wonder and confusion as we departed from the safe territory of problems with known solutions to the unknown world of asking (and trying to answer) entirely new questions. The experience was both empowering, showing us all the knowledge we have gained throughout our education, and deeply humbling as we struggled to apply this knowledge in different ways.One of the biggest challenges that new researchers face is the gap between the textbook level understanding they have gained in their coursework and the ways that these topics are pursued in cutting edge research in the field. This gap has undoubtedly always existed as no textbook can be entirely comprehensive or eternally up to date, but we have the sense that this gap has been widening in recent years. The gap is certainly large in interdisciplinary fields, where traditional courses or even entire study programs will not cover the range of topics required to be proficient in the field. But it seems that the gap is also widening in traditional disciplines as the publish or perish culture that has pervaded academia preferentially rewards output of top-level research articles over undergraduate textbooks.From the educational side, we can see the problem being addressed with an increasing shift toward research-based teaching, but we can also see that research-based teaching can and should be supported by a different style of publication tailored to these emerging researchers. Be they newly embarked on their research career or established researchers moving into new domains, all will benefit from a practical and pedagogical introduction to important topics for cutting edge research. We have seen the incredible appetite for these types of papers in the community with tutorials and user guides that have been published in recent years, (1−4) and this has encouraged us to officially highlight this type of publication with a new amendment to our information for authors across the nine ACS Au journals.In the short term, we offer a new type of publication, the \"Tutorial\", that we hope will help fill this gap in the literature. In the long term, we imagine collections of these tutorials that might provide a new way to effectively update textbooks, one chapter at a time.While the form and focus of an effective tutorial can vary significantly, we can suggest some guiding principles for authors embarking on this endeavor.Choosing a TopicClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The scope of a tutorial can either be relatively broad, e.g., an emerging field, or quite narrow, e.g., focused on a particular technique. A guiding principle is that it is a pedagogical introduction for a new reader in the area, providing information that cannot be found in a textbook or a research paper. Conceptual, Theoretical or PracticalA tutorial can encompass any and all of the aspects that are useful to bring a new reader into the field. In some instances, these can be important concepts that are difficult to draw out of the literature; in others, a theoretical description; and in many cases, a focus on practical execution, the how-to aspects of learning a new area. Feel free to use both the main text and the Supporting Information to educate the reader in how-to best practice. FAIR Data and CodeIn all cases, we strongly recommend making code and data available in association with the tutorial so that readers can immediately test play with the concept they are learning.We hope that both our readers and authors will enthusiastically embrace this change. It gives authors the opportunity to write the paper they wish they had been given when they entered the field and the paper they can and will hand out to prospective group members and use in their teaching to provide a gentler introduction to the world of their research. For our readers, we hope these papers will bridge the gap between the knowledge you already have and the research you want to do. Part of the privilege of being an open access journal is that we know these papers can reach readers, regardless of their circumstances, and we hope that we can provide a resource to inspire researchers wherever they are.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorGemma C.

ACS PublicationsPublished 2025 by American Chemical SocietySubjectswhat are subjectsArticle subjects are automatically applied from the ACS Subject Taxonomy and describe the scientific concepts and themes of the article.Chemistry educationGoldMaterialsPolymersUndergraduatesFor the last five years, ACS Publications has offered authors the ability to publish in two families of journals, our long-established family of journals that is available to readers through subscription as well as a newer family of open access (OA) journals where all published work is freely available to readers across the world. As part of the latter family of journals, the ACS Au open access journals were launched in 2021, greatly expanding ACS Publications' first forays into open access publishing that started with the launch of ACS Central Science (2015) and ACS Omega (2016). The ACS Au family of journals includes a large, selective multidisciplinary chemistry journal, JACS Au, serving as a companion to the flagship Journal of the American Chemical Society, and nine fully open access community focused journals covering the breadth of the chemical, biochemical, materials, environmental, and engineering disciplines.The launch of the ACS Au journal family further emphasizes ACS' commitment to supporting authors who choose, or are required by their funder, to publish in fully open access journals. As open access mandates continue to evolve around the world, we have continuously sought to provide authors with the options they need to publish their work in journals that feature high scientific rigor, thorough peer review, global impact and reach, and timely editorial decisions. Five years later, the journals are well-established and will continue to serve their communities as respected venues for high-quality research in chemistry and the allied fields.Recognizing that different authors have different accessibility to funding for Article Publication Charges (APCs), ACS also continues to support authors through the ACS special country pricing policy and ACS Read and Publish Agreements. Read and Publish agreements help institutions sustainably support the transition to open access, by growing the amount of work published open access, while also providing full access to ACS subscription content. Over the past five years, the number of ACS Read and Publish Agreements has expanded substantially, from covering 125 institutes in seven countries in 2019 to over 1,600 institutes across 46 countries in 2024 (Figure 1). 2024 also saw the establishment of first-of-their-kind \"Read and Green\" agreements to further expand the open access options ACS Publications provides for authors. We are delighted that ACS remains committed to expanding these agreements, enabling more authors to publish their work open access and for it to be available to anyone, anywhere in the world.Figure 1Figure 1. Growth of ACS Read and Publish Agreements since 2019.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWith such widespread and continually expanding coverage by Read and Publish agreements, authors based at many institutions around the world are choosing to publish open access even when their institutions or funding agencies do not require it. This is because open access papers and journals offer wider accessibility of published work, and authors naturally seek the broadest possible audience for their research products. Evidence for the increased usage can be seen in Figure 2, where the usage of hybrid ACS publications journals is dominated by researchers in East Asia and the Pacific (53%), the Western Hemisphere (21%), and Europe (19%), whereas usage of the Au family of journals includes a much stronger presence of readers in South Asia (15% vs 6% hybrid), the Middle East and North Africa (4.5% vs 1.2% hybrid), and Africa (1.5% vs 0.4% hybrid). All ten ACS Au journals received their inaugural full Journal Impact Factors (JIF) in the 2024 Journal Citation Reports, and with usage and citations continuing to grow year-on-year, it is anticipated that the momentum will continue as more researchers embrace open access publishing.Figure 2Figure 2. Global usage comparison of papers published in the ACS hybrid journal portfolio vs ACS gold open access journal portfolio 2021–2024.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe fully open access ACS Au journals have evolved to be highly author-centric. For instance, as a new journal, JACS Au is more than 10-fold smaller than the well-established Journal of the American Chemical Society, which allows our editorial team to invest substantial time understanding the nuance of each submission. In parallel, the Au community journals focus strongly on serving the needs of their respective scientific communities. As scientific communities are diverse, there have been numerous strategies employed to meet the needs of authors across the ten Au journals. For example, several editorials have been published across the portfolio that support authors by providing writing tips (DOI: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.2c00030), educating the community about giving proper CRediT (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.2c00029), and providing strategies for improving the visibility of publications (DOI: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00029). We have also leaned into the artistic creativity of our authors through editorials helping them with strategies for making cover art, and we have actively participated in the ACS Publications DEIR cover art series (DOIs: 10.1021/acsbiomedchemau.2c00028; 10.1021/acsorginorgau.2c00060; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00060; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00707; 10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00042; 10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00034; 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.4c00009). As the Au journals started during the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned quickly that a feeling of community is important for chemists and that our communities were looking for more than just advice on publishing. To this end, we have also provided editorials focused on mental health (10.1021/acspolymersau.2c00062) and strategies for fostering healthy, inclusive research ecosystems (10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00069; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00056).Another author- and reader-centric activity has been our focus on chemical education. Chemical education is critically important to the future of all chemists and our chemistry discipline, but traditionally, this topic has been primarily represented within the ACS Publications portfolio in the Journal of Chemical Education. The Au family of journals has the benefit that all content is available to anyone, anywhere in the world. Embracing this global reach, we have sought to publish interesting and innovative work on the pedagogy and scholarship of chemical education as well as new training materials of interest and value to researchers and educators across the globe who may not have access to ACS content through subscription. We have sought to ensure that the chemical education research community has a welcoming place to publish their latest research (DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00227; 10.1021/jacsau.3c00192), and we have supported the field through editorials and resources for educators. We have highlighted new teaching materials and cooperatives that help educators get the support and materials they need (DOIs: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.1c00020; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00014), and we have published open access tutorials and methods/protocols that can be used directly as alternatives or supplements to costly textbooks in undergraduate and graduate courses (DOIs: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00070; 10.1021/jacsau.4c00979). Finally, ACS has made a commitment to chemical educators at primarily undergraduate educational institutions with an ACS-sponsored Read and Publish agreement that waives the APC so that chemists can publish undergraduate research at over 170 institutions across the United States.Growing visibility and building relationships with the scientific communities we serve have been crucial for the ACS Au portfolio in these formative years. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to grow the number and diversity of publications in the journals and to celebrate this great content. It was also important to us that researchers at all career stages felt like they were represented. We have established an Early Career Advisory Board at JACS Au and the \"Rising Stars\" Special Issue series in the ACS Au community journals. Initiatives highlighting the researchers shaping the future of their fields will continue to be a feature of the Au journals into our future.As we close out this editorial, we would be remiss not to thank the numerous individuals and groups that have contributed to the growth and success of the Au family of journals. This includes our retired Editors and recently appointed Editors (Tables 1 and 2), as well as our dozens of dedicated Editorial Advisory Board members across the family of Au journals. We thank the authors who boldly submitted papers to our journals in the early days when global understanding of OA publishing was still limited, as well as our repeat authors who now, after five years, have published with us numerous times, in some cases more than a half dozen papers across the last four years. Finally, we have to thank all our referees. Peer review is the backbone of rigorous scientific publishing, and manuscripts published by ACS Publications are the most trusted, most cited, and most read because of the quality of our peer reviews and peer reviewers. Thank you to all the reviewers who have helped make the Au family of journals thrive.Table 1.

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the structural changes of lithium borate (LiB) glass 25Li2O-(75 - x)B2O3 was conducted in the absence and presence of lead(II) oxide or aluminum oxide (x = 10 mol %) glass modifiers. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were used to explore the structural properties of LiB glass by incorporating trace amounts of manganese(III) oxide (0.00-0.25 mol %) as a probe. Differential thermal analysis and XRD results for the glasses and their ceramics confirmed the integration of aluminum atoms into the glass framework by forming a lithium aluminum boron oxide Li2(AlB5O10) crystalline phase. Lead atoms were located interstitially, which disordered the borate glass structure and produced a lithium tetraborate crystalline phase. Semiempirical modeling of the glass structures was conducted to estimate the fundamental vibrational modes of the glass materials using a parametric method 3 (PM3MM) with molecular mechanics corrections to elucidate the geometry of the borate (BO3) groups and their possible vibrational modes. Our analysis revised the conventional representation of the tetrahedral BO4 units, which were not observed, to \"distorted-trigonal\" BO3 groups and associated with nonbridging oxygen (NBO) atoms. EPR spectroscopy established a link between the NBO in oxides and the well-defined peak at g-factor ∼4.2 in glass materials, which had been assigned to iron(III) ions according to the literature.",

    "abstract": "The kinetics of oxygen exchange dictate the rate of redox reactions, which is crucial for electrochemical-based sustainable technologies. In this study, we use isotope exchange pulse responses to elucidate the oxygen exchange mechanism for (Bi0.8Tm0.2)2O3-δ (BTM)-(La0.8Sr0.2)0.99MnO3-δ (LSM) composites. With an optimized composition and microstructure, these composites can achieve polarization resistances below 0.01 Ω·cm2 at 700 °C. Analysis of the oxygen exchange rate, , by splitting it into elementary processes using the serial two-step scheme, demonstrates that both the dissociative adsorption and incorporation of oxygen are accelerated in BTM-LSM compared to the parent phases. Dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen is rate-limiting below 900 °C in the range 0.002-0.05 atm O2 and below 850 °C in 0.21 atm O2. Cation interdiffusion or changes in the electronic structure at the interface between the two materials create an electrocatalytically active region spanning 1-40 nm around the BTM-LSM phase boundary. Oxygen exchange coefficients within this region were estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of the entire composite surface. We propose two potential pathways for oxygen exchange in BTM-LSM, with calculated p O2 dependencies for each rate-determining step (rds). The p O2 dependency of reveals that molecular oxygen is involved in the rds.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the low-temperature behavior of concentrated aqueous solutions of cesium chloride and discover two hydrates of CsCl. We employ four different methods, namely, (i) simple cooling at rates between 0.5 and 80 K s–1, (ii) simple cooling followed by pressurization, (iii) hyperquenching at 106 to 107 K s–1, and (iv) hyperquenching followed by pressurization. Depending on the method, different types of phase behaviors are observed, which encompass crystallization involving freeze-concentration, pressure-induced amorphization, full vitrification, and polyamorphic transformation. The CsCl hydrates discovered in our work cold-crystallize above 150 K upon heating after ultrafast vitrification (routes iii and iv) and show melting temperatures below the eutectic temperature of 251 K. We determine the composition of these hydrates to be CsCl·5H2O and CsCl·6H2O and find evidence for their existence in ESEM, calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. The dominant and less metastable hydrate is the hexahydrate, where the pentahydrate appears as a minority species. We also reveal the birthplace for the CsCl hydrates, namely, the freeze-concentrated solution (FCS) formed upon cold-crystallization of the fully glassy solution (from iii and iv). The spongy FCS produced upon cooling of the liquid (from i and ii) is incapable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. By contrast, the FCS produced upon heating the glassy solution (from iii and iv) shows tiny, fine features that are capable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. Our findings contradict the current knowledge that alkali chlorides only have hydrates for the smaller cations Li+ and Na+, but not for the larger cations K+, Rb+, and Cs+ and pave the way for future determination of CsCl-hydrate crystal structures. The pathway to metastable crystalline materials outlined here might be more generally applicable and found in nature, e.g., in comets or on interstellar dust grains, when glassy aqueous solutions crystallize upon heating.",

    "abstract": "Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) → FH(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity toward small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F + H2 system and its isotopic variant F + HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS_Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Akhmatskaya, E.; Sokolovski, D. Comput. Phys. Commun. 2022, 277, 108370].",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic chemicals found in numerous industrial applications and everyday products. The excessive amounts of PFASs in water and soil, together with their link to severe health issues, have prompted substantial public concerns, making their removal from the environment a necessity. Existing degradation techniques are frequently lacking due to their low efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and potential for secondary contamination. Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) technology has emerged as a promising alternative, utilizing energized reactive species to break down PFASs under ambient conditions. Therefore, this review examines the efficacy and effectiveness of CAP in degrading PFASs by reviewing various CAP setups and examining the key factors involved. This review also aims to further the development of CAP as a viable solution for PFAS degradation by addressing outstanding challenges and future directions in soil and water treatment.",
