    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest owing to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.",

However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (k\n            cat = 13 s−1, >1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Quantum-confined nanoclusters can be described by the jellium model, which emphasizes closed-shell electron configurations, but an open-shell variation with jellium aromaticity has been proposed. Such clusters are termed superatoms because they behave like an atom, and they exhibit unusual properties. Superatoms feature metal–metal bonding; hence, since their discovery 40 years ago, superatoms have exclusively involved main group or transition metals, with actinides only considered computationally as dopants owing to actinide–actinide bonding being exceedingly rare. Here we report trithorium nanoclusters exhibiting three-centre-one-electron actinide–actinide bonding. Experimental and computational analysis demonstrates Robin–Day Class III 6d-orbital valence delocalization in these clusters. These S = 1/2 clusters are paramagnetic, but in external applied magnetic fields they exhibit exalted diamagnetism, evidencing actinide open-shell jellium aromaticity superatom character. Exalted diamagnetism is not normally associated with a single unpaired electron, but with a 1S\n            1 magic number, the valence delocalization enables exalted diamagnetism, which is aromaticity, via superatom ring currents.",

However, small molecules typically lack the spatiotemporal precision required in highly non-invasive, controlled settings. Here we present the development of a cell-permeable small-molecule DNA G-quadruplex (G4) binder, termed G4switch, that can be reversibly toggled on and off by visible light. We have biophysically characterized the light-mediated control of G4 binding in vitro, followed by cellular, genomic mapping of G4switch to G4 targets in chromatin to confirm G4-selective, light-dependent binding in a cellular context. By deploying G4switch in living cells, we show spatiotemporal control over the expression of a set of G4-containing genes and G4-associated cell proliferation. Our studies demonstrate a chemical tool and approach to interrogate the dynamics of key biological processes directly at the molecular level in cells.",

    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution of self-replicating entities most likely played a key role in the emergence of life from inanimate matter. For evolution to occur, self-replicators must (1) have structural space accessible to them, (2) occupy only part of it at any time, and (3) navigate it through mutation and selection. We describe a system of self-replicating hexameric macrocycles formed upon the mixing of two building blocks and occupying a subset of possible sequences. Specific interactions, most likely through steric zipper formation, favor a hexamer sequence where the two blocks alternate. Under different replication-destruction regimes, distinct replicator mutants are selected. With non-selective destruction (via outflow), the fastest replicators dominate. With chemically mediated, selective destruction, a mutant that balances replication speed and resistance to reduction by steric zipper formation becomes dominant. This system demonstrates a rudimentary form of Darwinian evolution, where replicators adapt to changing selection pressures through mutation and selection.",

    "abstract": "For many slow solar-fuel-forming reactions, the accumulation of photogenerated minority carriers on the photoelectrode surface leads to light-induced band edge unpinning, affecting the junction properties by decreasing band bending in the semiconductor space charge layer and increasing the driving force of surface reactions in the electric double layer. In this study, we demonstrate a contactless operando electric field-induced second harmonic generation (EFISH) method for measuring the band bending change (δΔΦSCRL) on photoelectrodes upon photoexcitation. For n-doped rutile TiO2 water oxidation photoanodes at pH 7, δΔΦSCRL increases at more positive potentials or higher illumination power density until it reaches saturation values. We show that under fast mass transport conditions, δΔΦSCRL is exclusively attributed to the accumulated charged rate-determining species that can be regarded as temporary surface states, and the relationship between the photocurrent and δΔΦSCRL can be well modeled by assuming that hole trap states function as the reaction center. Kinetic isotope experiments identify proton-coupled electron transfer as the rate-determining step and suggest a possible chemical nature of the key intermediate. We demonstrate that light-induced band edge unpinning is a beneficial feature under high illumination conditions for oxygen evolution reaction on TiO2 because it maintains the photon-to-current conversion efficiency by enhancing the surface reaction driving force, shedding light on the actual device application.",

    "abstract": "Non-classical electromechanical properties, such as large electrostriction stress coefficient and low dielectric constant in Zr-doped ceria and other doped cerium oxides, discovered in the last several years, are the focus of intense research as they indicate the existence of solids with unusually large anharmonicity of chemical bonds. Theoretical models of electrostriction mechanisms rely on the concept of elastic dipoles that are formed due to the local structural distortions around dopants. The structural, dynamic, and electronic descriptors of the pre-existing (at zero field) dipoles (as in aliovalent-doped ceria) and those dynamically formed under the electric field (as in isovalent-doped ceria) are unknown. Here, the characteristics of the local structure and dynamics of the dopant and host bonding environments were obtained by using the temperature-dependent X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The candidate set of descriptors was identified in a quasiharmonic approximation for the nearest neighboring bonds between Zr (Ce) and the atoms in the first and second coordination shells. The descriptors included static bond length disorder, the anharmonicity of the effective pair potential, and effective force constants for the probed atomic pairs. The observation of significant Zr-O bond anharmonicity confirms previous first-principles calculations. The structural model, emerging from these simulations, emphasizes significant free volume around Zr in the oxygen cube, explaining both the mechanical anomaly (the decrease in Young's modulus with Zr concentration) as well as correlating at least one descriptor (static disorder) to the measured electrostriction coefficient. This descriptor-based approach can be extended to studies under applied electric fields or stress in this and other materials.",

    "abstract": "The functionality of materials is intrinsically linked to their structures, an axiom encapsulated in the principle of structure-property relationships. The pinnacle of materials design is the tailoring of its structure for a specific function, which requires the ability of rational synthesis and the development of synthesis science. This idea, however, remains elusive for the synthesis of complex extended solids. A major obstacle is the difficulty in using established chemical principles selectively to control reaction paths and favor certain structural patterns over numerous other possible results. In this context, we are developing a synthesis science approach that facilitates the control of the structure and bonding to create new structures. This is achieved by employing a two-component flux consisting of mixed hydroxides and halides as the reaction medium. This enables reaction conditions that allow better control of the structure dimensionality and composition by manipulating the temperature and solvent basicity (via the flux component ratio). We demonstrate the efficacy of this method in controlling their structural motifs to arrive at 23 unreported compositions and 6 unique structure types. These materials are expected to exhibit a broad range of properties, from metallic to semiconducting, with calculations suggesting the potential for emergent phenomena such as Dirac semimetals. The reaction paths afforded by these mixed fluxes establish a direct correlation between the synthetic variables and properties, providing significant insight into a broadly applicable approach for new materials.",

For dienes and dienophiles, most people will naturally use them to carry out the classic Diels-Alder reaction to construct six-membered cyclic compounds. Here, we demonstrated a chemoselective coupling of butadiene with dienophiles through stereoselective 1,3-cyclotelomerization. By utilizing robust Ni/IPr catalysis, valuable bicyclic products were created with high regio- and chemoselectivities under mild conditions. Asymmetric cyclotelomerization enabled by the chiral NHC ligand was also performed, generating enantioenriched bicyclic compounds. The reaction mechanism was also investigated via experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which indicate that the reaction might start with oxidative cyclometalation between two molecules of 1,3-diene and Ni(0) species, followed by a [3 + 2]-cycloaddition between nickelacycle and dienophile. The products can undergo a variety of intricate transformations, which emphasizes the potential applications of this strategy. It is hoped that the discovery of this protocol will further inspire people to rethink classic organic reactions.",

In particular, V(TCNE)2, a compound with a three-dimensional network structure composed of vanadium(II) centers linked by tetracyanoethylene (TCNE•-) radical anions, displays magnonic properties comparable to yttrium iron garnet, the quintessential magnonic material in the field. However, existing solution and chemical vapor deposition methods for synthesizing V(TCNE)2 require the use of highly reactive zero-valent molecular vanadium precursors, stymying research on this important material. Herein, we report a facile electrochemical method for the deposition of thin films of V(TCNE)2 using readily obtainable and stable divalent vanadium precursors and TCNE•- anions generated by electrochemical reduction. Magnetization measurements reveal that the films exhibit ferrimagnetic ordering above room temperature, consistent with V(TCNE)2 films synthesized via other methods. Moreover, the electrodeposited films exhibit narrow FMR linewidths as low as 17.5 G and a low Gilbert damping coefficient of 1.1 × 10-3, values that are on par with some currently integrated metallic magnonic materials. More generally, these results demonstrate that electrodeposition can provide a straightforward means of generating high-performance magnonic materials using readily available molecular precursors.",

Developing rapid, sensitive and specific in situ virus detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)‐based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN‐based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV‐RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV‐RNA within 12 min in a cell‐free environment, enabling real‐time imaging of JEV‐RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN‐based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.",

During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first‐shell functionalization.

Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti‐counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties.

This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent‐colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf‐like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via π‐electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.",

BNB‐OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi‐planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long‐range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB‐OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%.

Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3·(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3·(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3·(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of H3Al·(NMP)1.0 through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. Importantly, H3Al·(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well‐defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased polydispersity and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.",

While cryo‐electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric αSyn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod‐like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid‐state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C‐terminal domain of the monomeric αSyn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C‐terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C‐terminal domain that influences aSyn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of αSyn.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts on a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and ageing. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerisation is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. Aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. To this end, the UV‐denaturation experiment developed at the B23 beamline of the Diamond Light Source (UK) is employed, which high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beamlight induce protein denaturation when repeated consecutive synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra are acquired in the far‐UV region, diagnostic of protein folding. This allows the estimation of protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV‐denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light‐induced damage to proteins.",

The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of ¹O₂ following its photo‐catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to ¹O₂ through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500‐fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 µs and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high‐surface charge (>+30 mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary “proof of principle” staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time‐gated measurements, that is, to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.",

A set of samples, CPFD‐B/N‐5, CPFD‐B/N‐10, and CPFD‐B/N‐15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol‐formaldehyde‐dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD‐N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder‐free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behavior. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD‐B/N‐10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22 Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00 W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid‐state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb.",

However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT•Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N‐dimethylformamide, and water, the UV‐visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50–100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 – 14 × 109 M−2). While the formation of charge‐transfer states through ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal‐bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.",

Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl‐type reaction involving both 1,4‐aryl‐ and 1,2‐aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation‐ and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation‐ or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.",

Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E–Z photoisomerization but also the 6π‐photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes. The symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical diarylethenes and satisfied the Woodward‐Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole‐based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in diarylethenes, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the 6π‐photocyclization.",

Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis‐1,2‐diaminocyclohexane (cis‐DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis‐DACH with 3‐(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com­plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis‐DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol‐% only. The achiral cis‐DACH salan catalyst showed syn‐selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)‐citronellene, and (R)‐linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti‐selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti‐selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)‐citronellene and (R)‐linalool when the \"matched\" enantiomer of the chiral \"Berkessel salalen ligand\" is employed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N‐alkyl‐N, N′‐diarylhydrazines by boronic acid‐catalyzed one‐pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N–N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation‐sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late‐stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Brønsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Brønsted acid and H‐bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate‐limiting step.",

In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine‐based COFs, yielding TFPT‐sp2c‐COF, with a C═C linkage and TFPT‐IM‐COF, with a C═N linkage. TFPT‐sp2c‐COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT‐IM‐COF. More importantly, the C═C linkage in TFPT‐sp2c‐COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C═N linkage in TFPT‐IM‐COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and π‐delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT‐sp2c‐COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT‐IM‐COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species.

    "abstract": "AbstractGlycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror‐image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the “glycan code” enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D‐ and L‐sugars. Herein, we present an in‐depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin–glycan recognition, using the well‐characterized human C‐type lectin Dendritic cell‐specific ICAM‐3‐grabbing nonintegrin (DC‐SIGN) as a model. By combining experimental (STD‐NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC‐SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2⁺‐coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L‐fucose and D‐mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC‐SIGN also binds α/β‐L‐galactose, α/β‐D‐rhamnose, and myo‐inositol. Among these, α/β‐D‐rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than α‐OMe‐D‐mannose, while α/β‐L‐galactose binds more strongly than D‐rhamnose and myo‐inositol, although with lower affinity than α‐OMe‐L‐fucose. STD‐NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties which are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present novel approach for size‐tunable diameter separation of single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal‐coordinating supramolecular polymers (M‐PNB) consisting of phenanthroline‐based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M‐PNB is confirmed by TEM analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 – 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 – 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M‐PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)‐SWNTs. This method offers not only size‐tunable diameter selectivity, but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency, and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.",

    "abstract": "The vortex features a helical structure and exhibits macroscopic chirality. Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal‐organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex‐responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptical silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent‐colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex‐induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.",

NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand's versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. In addition, π‐interactions between the cation and the cation‐facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from π‐interactions with both cation‐facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These π‐interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.",

Divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. We report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H‐bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide‐sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H‐bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H‐bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H‐bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine‐bound CYP119 to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. We show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate‐Fe bond than the pyrrolidine‐bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H‐bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results suggest thiolate H‐bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.",

We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase mediated nitrogen fixation in Rhodobacter capsulatus. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into ∆fdxC and ∆fdxN R. capsulatus‐deletion strains under N2‐fixing conditions, showed that plasmid‐based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe‐nitrogenase activity in both ∆fdxC and ∆fdxN strains, whilst plasmid‐based fdxC expression could only complement the ∆fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen‐bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]‐cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, whilst providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2‐fixation.",

The fluorophore exhibits Crystallization‐Induced Emission Enhancement and pH‐dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of non‐emissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited‐State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state, and rationalized the large Stokes’ shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli‐responsive properties.",

The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6‐methyl‐2‐pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one‐electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox‐coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand‐centered and involve the three sq•‐/cat2‐ couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.",

    "abstract": "Low‐dimensional halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for single‐component white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in two‐dimensional (2D) systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange‐red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+‐induced extrinsic self‐trapped exciton (STE) which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange‐red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)→6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%‐51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation‐dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high‐performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.",

The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerisation of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher‐intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure imparts deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light‐sensitive molecular components through covalent synthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe recently renovated two‐chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of α‐helix‐rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different‐type two‐chain protein, that is, bromelain inhibitor VI (BI‐VI), which has abundant β‐sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)‐ and light (L)‐chains of BI‐VI were mixed at 4 °C in a pH of 10.0 buffer solution containing 2 mM GSH and 0.4 mM GSSG, native BI‐VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53%) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI‐VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non‐activity. The rate‐limiting step of the two‐chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three‐SS intermediates of the H‐chain (3SSH) and one‐SS intermediates of the L‐chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multichain proteins with more complicated SS‐bond topologies.",

To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide‐ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid‐catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity‐adjustable structure is generated, which not only addresses the conductivity–toughness trade‐off of AEM but also possesses high OH− conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98 V (pure water) and 1.62 V (1 M KOH) at 1 A cm−2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high‐performance AEMWE.",

    "abstract": "The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate‐dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde‐ketone cross‐coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large‐scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2‐oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy‐2‐propanone to the product 2‐hydroxy‐2‐methyl‐1‐phenoxypentan‐3‐one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single‐point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (>90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2‐oxopentanoate, the double variant K567S_Y297P showed a 5‐fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain‐containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family‐related targets, for example, BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non‐BET proteins were reported so far. Among them, BRD9 was recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9‐targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3‐a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL‐based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.",

Compared to traditional batch processes, our flow approach enables the use of a single organolithium reagent and operates efficiently at 0 °C, avoiding the cool-warm-cool temperature cycles typical of batch methods.

In this method, Na2HPO4 was used to form hydrogen bonds with the C3 hydroxyl group of α-glucoside, thereby generating C3 free radicals, and p-cyanobenzaldehyde was used to dehydrogenate the free radical intermediates to achieve site-selective oxidation. This approach achieves a high selectivity for both glycosidic bond configurations and glycosylated forms. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through single-electron transfer and radical coupling with the quinuclidine playing a key role in hydrogen atom transfer. This method provides a powerful tool for site-selective glycan oxidation, offering significant potential for applications in carbohydrate chemistry and glycobiology.",

Spectroscopic evidence shows that the coupling reaction happens via initial reductive quenching of the Ir(III) catalyst under visible light.

Selective cleavage of thioketals requires the use of harsh conditions and reagents that limit the use of thioketals in chemoenzymatic synthesis. Herein, we describe a biocatalytic strategy for the cleavage of thioketals using enzymatic bromide recycling by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) enzymes. This reaction design involves halogenation-mediated thioketal cleavage through repetitive enzyme-mediated formation of hypobromous acid with a catalytic quantity of bromide salt and hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant. This protocol is demonstrated on a broad range of 1,3-dithiolanes in high yield and excellent chemoselectivity, performed on a gram scale, run with lysate and whole cells, and applied to the cleavage of 1,3-dithianes and 1,3-oxathiolanes.",

These intermediates exhibit nucleophilic character and undergo readily condensation reactions with aldehydes and ketones giving rise to target products. The mechanism of the latter reaction was studied by means of DFT calculations showing that activation of the carbonyl partner occurs through the formation of the hydrogen bond with the B(OH)2 group rather than through an interaction with the Lewis acid boron atom due to a plausible FLP-like behavior. The molecular structures of a few derivatives were determined by X-ray crystallography showing that in all cases, the molecules assemble through intermolecular BOH···O═P hydrogen bonds.",

The regioselective para-alkylation was conducted with unprotected anilines in a metal-free environment, while N-H alkylations were effectively performed under similarly mild conditions. DFT calculations were carried out to understand the distinctive chemoselectivity of N-alkylation and C-alkylation of unprotected arylamines with different nonpolar (toluene) and polar protic (HFIP) solvents. Furthermore, the different transition state models identified in our calculations shed light on the intricate interplay between solvent effects and reaction selectivity.",

The method is further demonstrated with other Michael-type substrates, including 2-formyl glycals and 3-keto glycals.

The products of the deactivation were identified as diastereoisomeric phosphates (R,1R,2R)-3a and (R,1S,2S)-3b and are formed via an alkene bromophosphatation process where the phosphate of 1 behaves as a competitive nucleophile, as confirmed by authentic preparations of 3a and 3b from a stoichiometric bromophosphatation reaction. HPLC separation of the diastereoisomers gave pure 3a whose absolute and relative configurations were proven by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of phosphate 3a displayed four resonances despite 3a having just one phosphorus atom, and combined VT-NMR and DFT analysis revealed this to be a consequence of rotational isomerism about the 9-phenanthrene (Ar) bearing C3,3'-Ar bonds. Moreover, kinetic studies using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) of the catalytic cyclohexene bromoesterification showed first order kinetics in all reactants. The amount of phosphates 3a and 3b formed under catalytic bromoesterification conditions was quantified, enabling tracking of the temporal catalyst 1 concentration and hence elucidation of first order kinetics in catalyst 1. A catalytic cycle consistent with these observations is proposed.",

In 8 out of 12 cases, the observed enantiomeric excess was 36-92% higher when DBU or Cs2CO3 was added. Nucleophile crossover experiments between the N-benzyl-1,3-diphenylallylamine product and 4-methoxybenzylamine mechanistically linked the changes in enantioselectivity to reformation of the η3-allylpalladium intermediate. In the crossover reactions with 9 out of 12 chiral ligands, 10-75% less elimination to 1-phenylbutadiene was observed with Cs2CO3 than with DBU. Analysis of percent crossover vs percent completion of the simultaneous reaction of 1-phenyl-3-methylallyl ethyl carbonate in the crossover experiment revealed that (1) the formation of the 1,3-diphenylallylpalladium intermediate frequently occurred before the reaction of 1-phenyl-3-methylallyl ethyl carbonate was complete, (2) the addition of DBU or Cs2CO3 suppressed formation of the 1,3-diphenylallylpalladium intermediate, and (3) the less polar toluene and THF solvents resulted in less or slower formation of the 1,3-diphenylallylpalladium intermediate than the more polar DCM and DMF solvents.",

The commonly employed hydroboration-oxidation sequence for the synthesis of terminal alcohols is challenging for allylic alcohols, and O-protection of the alcohol can be necessary. To increase atom economy, we explored the use of silane protecting groups that can be engaged in intramolecular hydrosilylation. Oxidative cleavage of the cyclized product yields the desired 1,3-diol and obviates the need for super-stoichiometric borane reagents. Based on a detailed study of O-silylation conditions, a protocol is presented that furnishes quantitative yields of a wide range of O-silylated alcohols which contain Si–H bonds for further functionalization. We show that a MOF-based Rh(II) porphyrin can furnish efficient intramolecular hydrosilylation while the corresponding homogeneous analogue proved unreactive. Radical trapping studies suggest that silyl radicals constitute key intermediates in Rh(II) catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation. Preferential 5-endo-trig versus 6-exo-trig cyclization and 5-exo-trig versus 6-endo-trig cyclization of the silyl radical intermediates led to chemoselective 1,3-diol formation for substrates containing multiple olefins.",

Modifying the ferrocene core and its side chains is crucial for fine-tuning its redox properties, solubility, and stability, thereby enhancing its performance in various applications. This review discusses the synthesis of ferrocene compounds potentially relevant to electrochemical applications, focusing on recent strategies for nondirected C–H functionalization of the ferrocene core and diverse reactions for side-chain modifications. Advances in C–H activation of ferrocenes have been facilitated by catalytic methods utilizing Pd, Ir, Au, In, and Fe catalysts, as well as through photoredox and electrochemical techniques. Furthermore, side chains are modified via a range of mild transformations compatible with the ferrocene core, including substitution and annulation. These advancements in synthesizing ferrocene derivatives have broadened their potential applications, notably as electron-transfer mediators, energy-storage systems, and sensors.1 \tIntroduction2 \tNondirected C–H Activation of Ferrocene and Its Derivatives3 \tSide-Chain Modification of Ferrocene Derivatives4 \tApplications of Ferrocene Derivatives in Electrochemistry5 \tConclusion",

Here an improved kilogram scale synthesis of Abiraterone is presented, starting from commercially available dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by employing Quality by Design (QbD) principles, statistical design of experiments (DoE), and green metrics parameters to evaluate the environmental impact and efficiency. This article focuses on identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs), exploring the relationship between CQAs and material attributes (MAs), and determining the critical process parameters (CPPs) for synthesizing hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediates, and the final product, Abiraterone acetate. The presented approach effectively managed critical impurities and achieved impressive yields of 98, 84, and 78% with purity >99% in the hydrazone, vinyl iodide intermediate, and final API, respectively. The improved synthesis was optimized and scaled for multi-kilogram batches, addressing challenges from previous methods and yielding ICH quality material in 65% overall yield.",

The initial discovery chemistry route required chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) at the end of the synthesis to provide enantiopure product. XtalFluor-E was used for deoxyfluorination on a ketone adjacent to a p-pyridylmethyl position, resulting in very low yields due to the elimination of HF. After several unsuccessful attempts for a de novo asymmetric synthesis, we focused our attention on the process development for a more practical synthesis than the existing route. A much higher yielding deoxyfluorination was enabled by SF4 and HF. Furthermore, the chiral SFC was replaced by an efficient classical resolution at a much earlier stage of the synthesis, taking advantage of the basicity of the pyridine moiety before oxidation to the pyridine N-oxide. Although not all stages have been scaled up in the plant scale, the new synthesis is much more practical and has improved the overall yield from 12% to 23% for this challenging molecule.",

Hence, regioselective C–S bond formation, which is produced at the C2 or C3 position of indolin-3-one, was achieved, depending on the presence or absence of a base and, advantageously, without the need for a transition metal catalyst and additional synthetic steps.",

The limitations of the reaction are explored and it is found that when 2-chlorobenzimidazole is used as a dinucleophile, 5-trifluoromethyl-3-substituted furans are obtained (three examples, yields of 57–67%).

To find a protocol applicable to most substrates of interest, we optimized three different substrates: a bulky arene (mesityl bromide), an electron-rich arene [4-(NMe2)C6H4Br], and an electron-deficient arene [3,5-(CF3)2C6H3Br]. The re-optimized procedures give as good or better yields than the previously published protocols, always in a fraction of the time.

Traditional synthetic processes typically employ sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution, which results in low product yields and generates large quantities of wastewater. In this study, calcium oxide is utilized as an alternative to sodium hydroxide, and the aldol condensation is carried out in anhydrous ethanol. Calcium oxide not only serves as a basic catalyst for the aldol condensation reaction but also reacts with the generated water to form calcium hydroxide, thereby removing water from the reaction system. This effectively shifts the equilibrium of the aldol condensation reaction, leading to a higher conversion rate of isovanillin and a significantly improved yield of 3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, reaching 85.2%. This study provides a novel and efficient green synthetic approach to 3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, offering significant potential for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective C–H activation via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has gained significant interest recently. One industrial application for HAT can be found in the tertiary benzylic C–H bond of cumene for producing phenol, a versatile chemical feedstock for various industries. However, the overall phenol yield remains low using the existing Hock process due to the poor selectivity towards the key reaction intermediate, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy for phenol production through photooxidation of cumene to CHP using iron bromide under blue light irradiation, where bromine radicals (generated in situ via ligand-to-metal charge transfer) are used as hydrogen atom abstractors. Mechanistic studies revealed the cumene-to-CHP conversion occurred via a tertiary C–H bond abstraction by a radical mechanism, and the acetic acid and water additives increased CHP selectivity through stabilizing peroxides. The cumene-phenol process achieved up to 88% yield of CHP in 1 hour and could be used with a wide range of substrates. We thus developed a selective, mild, and efficient phenol production method using iron bromide under photooxidative conditions.",

The use of flow chemistry technology, nonetheless, has made a tremendous impact in this field, improving the efficiency of multiphasic processes through improved mass transfer and larger interfacial areas.

Originally reported in a racemic fashion by Molander and Doyle, this transformation was re-examined using chiral bis(oxazoline) ligands, revealing distinct enantioselectivity trends depending on the halogen present in the aryl halide and Ni pre-catalyst. Stoichiometric experiments demonstrated that the Ni(II) oxidative addition complex is primarily responsible for trapping the THF radical, while multivariate linear regression modeling confirmed that the halide remains coordinated during the enantiodetermining step. Time-course experiments uncovered an alternative initial pathway when Ni(0) was used as the pre-catalyst, which ultimately converged to the main Ni(II) pathway. EPR analysis further revealed rapid comproportionation between Ni(0) and Ni(II), forming Ni(I) species that engage in radical trapping at early stages, accounting for the observed reactivity differences. By integrating enantioselectivity data with experimental techniques such as EPR spectroscopy, this study establishes enantioinduction analysis as a powerful tool for mechanistic investigations in Ni photochemical catalysis. The insights gained not only refine our understanding of this transformation, but also provide a framework for probing similar Ni/Ir dual photocatalytic systems.1 \tIntroduction2 \tEnantioselectivity Data Highlights a Complex Mechanistic Scenario3 \tProbing the Predominant Pathway with Stoichiometric Experiments4 \tMLR Modeling to Understand the Halogen Effect on the Enantioinduction5 \tProposed Prevalent Mechanism6 \tInitiation with Ni(0) Precatalyst7 \tConclusion",

    "abstract": "AbstractFunctionalized xanthenes occupy an important position in medicinal chemistry due to their wide range of pharmacological properties. The xanthene skeleton is present in various bioactive natural products such as mulgravanols A and B, hermannol, (+)-myrtucommulone D, homapanicones A and B, blumeaxanthene II, acrotrione, etc. Important xanthene-based drugs, including propantheline bromide, methantheline, phloxine B, etc., are available on the market. Thus, much effort has been dedicated to generating or modifying xanthenes as crucial O-heterocyclic compounds. Recently, the development of efficient processes for the synthesis of xanthene derivatives using modern techniques has received significant attention in an effort to overcome the disadvantages of traditional methodologies. Aligned with the sixth principle of green chemistry, in which minimum energy is needed to perform synthetic methods at ambient temperature with optimum productivity, this account focuses on green, room-temperature strategies for the synthesis of xanthenes with anticancer activities using modern synthetic methodologies. 1 \tIntroduction2 \tSynthesis of Functionalized Xanthene Derivatives through Green Strategies at Room Temperature3 \tMedicinal Perspectives on Functionalized Xanthene Derivatives as Anticancer Agents4 \tConclusion5 \tList of Abbreviations",

Today the direct activation and functionalization of relatively inert C–H bonds is one of the top fields in organic chemistry, and this strategy already represents a sustainable and more environmentally friendly approach due to its atom and step economy compared to alternative C–C and C–Het bond-forming processes. Much progress has been made in developing C–H bond functionalization methods using noble-metal catalysts. Cobalt has recently emerged as an attractive alternative because it is less toxic, cheaper, and more abundant than noble metals.

This discovery prompted extensive research into its synthesis, as well as its chemical and biological applications. The isatin scaffold undergoes several key chemical reactions, including oxidation, reduction, ring expansion, Friedel-Crafts reactions, and aldol condensation, resulting in the formation of biologically active compounds such as 2-oxindoles, tryptanthrin, indirubins, and others. In recent years, numerous derivatives of isatin, particularly those involving N-, C3-, and C5-positions, have been synthesized and investigated for their diverse biological activities, with some even receiving FDA approval as therapeutic agents. This account provides a concise overview of the isatin scaffold, highlighting its synthesis, reactivity, and structural features of the scaffold as well as those of its main derivatives, particularly their ability to engage in various non-covalent interactions. Finally, selected recent biological applications of isatin derivatives are discussed, with an emphasis on contributions from our own research group.

Molecular docking studies on the mTOR protein (PDB ID: 4JT6) revealed strong binding affinities, with key interactions at active site residues. MD simulations in GROMACS (50 ns) confirmed the stability of compound-protein complexes. In vitro cytotoxicity assays against A549, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines showed potent activity, with UC-RS-04 displaying an IC50 of 0.027 µM in lung cancer, outperforming standard drugs like 5-Fluorouracil (0.28 µM) and Everolimus (0.09 µM).

We have recently reported an efficient copper-catalyzed regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective allylic alkylation of allyl bromides using 1,1-diborylalkanes as prochiral hard nucleophiles. This methodology employs CuBr as a catalyst, an (R)-BINOL-derived phosphoramidite as a chiral ligand, and lithium benzoate as a crucial additive, providing enantioenriched homoallylic boronic esters in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity. Our mechanistic investigations revealed that lithium benzoate is key in facilitating highly selective anti-SN2'-type oxidative addition, offering valuable insights for further development of asymmetric copper catalysis.",

Despite significant advancements, the diversity of catalytic systems has remained relatively limited, as the reductive potential of Ni species is highly dependent on the ligand employed. Recently, we identified organometallic zirconaaziridine as an effective redox-transmetalating reagent in Ni catalysis, enabling two distinct applications: diastereoselectively modulable catalytic C(sp2)-glycosylation and the selective consecutive assembly of C(sp2) fragments at a methylene CH2 carbon. Notably, extensive experimental and computational studies support a “sequential reduction” mechanism, wherein oxidative addition of Ni(I)-X to C(sp2)-I, halide abstraction of C(sp3)-I by C(sp2)-Ni(I), and radical capture by C(sp2)-Ni(II) proceed with high selectivity. 1Introduction 2Redox-transmetalation 3Example 1: diastereoselective C(sp2)-glycosylation",

Furthermore, their ability to form organized, higher-dimensional assemblies presents a promising avenue for overcoming scalability challenges in quantum technologies. Despite their potential, achieving high luminescence quantum yields has largely been limited to donor-functionalized monoradicals, and a detailed understanding of the luminescent behavior of open-shell organic molecules remains elusive.

We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance. We suggest first steps that researchers can take to move towards a positive culture of data sharing in organic chemistry.

Despite their potential, their structural diversity is still limited and a larger pool of substitution patterns remains to be systematically investigated. This is paramount as electronic effects play a crucial role in the behavior of photoswitches and a deeper understanding enables their straightforward development for specific applications. In this work, we synthesized novel N-acylpyrazole-based photoswitches and conducted a comparative study with 33 phenylazopyrazoles, comparing their photoswitching properties and the impact of electronic effects. Using UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy, we discovered that simple acylation of the pyrazole moiety leads to increased quantum yields of isomerization, long Z-isomer life-times, good spectral separation, and high photostability.",

In this article, we report the synthesis of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,3-diones via a reversible transimination reaction between Schiff’ base (C=N) linkage-containing pyrrolidine-2,3-dione derivatives and methylamine with yields of 80 to 92%. In addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-1,5-diphenylpyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5a) was also verified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized molecules were evaluated for compliance with established drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, Egan, and Muegge), as well as ADMET properties. All compounds satisfied these criteria, indicating favorable oral bioavailability. Molecular docking analysis showed that compounds 5a–e act as ligands for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), especially with Cys200 and Ser242 via hydrogen bonds. In addition, van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the ligand–iNOS complexes. In particular, 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidene-5-phenyl-1-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,3-dione (5e) exhibited the strongest binding affinity (−9.51 kcal/mol) and demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production, with an IC50 value of 43.69 ± 5.26 µM. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (-NO2 group) on the benzene ring at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine-2,3-dione subunit in compound 5e may be responsible for the observed high inhibition activity due to the enhancement and optimization of hydrogen bonding with Cys200. These results underscore the potential of 4-(1-methylamino)ethylidenepyrrolidine-2,3-diones, especially compound 5e, as promising scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory agents targeting iNOS-related pathologies.",

A full catalytic cycle for the enantioselective synthesis of α-hydrazinonitriles is proposed based on insights gained from DFT calculations. Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) has been used as a sacrificial cyanide source. We found that isocyanide (rather than cyanide) is a preferred coordination to calcium during the catalytic cycle, while the active catalyst prefers a side-on coordination of cyanide. The configuration-determining step is a hydrocyanation via a calcium isocyanide complex, whereas the rate-limiting step is that which recovers the calcium catalyst and replaces the TMS-bound product from the catalyst. While our experimental data demonstrate enantioselectivity values as high as 89% under certain conditions, the overall enantioselectivity achieved with the calcium catalyst remains modest, mainly due to competing pathways for the Z- and E-hydrazone isomers leading to opposite enantiomers. The experimental results confirm these computational proposals.",

A recently introduced orthogonally photoswitchable heterobivalent azobenzene Glc/Man glycocluster was utilized to examine these aspects of carbohydrate recognition in a bacterial adhesion–inhibition assay. The measured results were systematically contextualized employing new reference compounds such as the respective homobivalent Man/Man glycocluster.

F8-Phenacenes were conveniently synthesized by the Mallory photoreaction of the corresponding fluorinated diarylethenes as the key step. Upon fluorination on the phenacene cores, the absorption and fluorescence bands of the F8-phenacenes in CHCl3 systematically red-shifted by ca. 3–5 nm compared to those of the corresponding parent phenacenes. The vibrational progressions of the absorption and fluorescence bands were little affected by the fluorination in the solution phase. In the solid state, the absorption band of F8-phenacenes appeared in the similar wavelength region for the corresponding parent phenacenes whereas their fluorescence bands markedly red-shifted and broadened. These observations suggest that the intermolecular interactions of excited-state F8-phenacene molecules are significantly different from those of the corresponding parent molecules, most likely due to different crystalline packing motifs.",

    "abstract": "Fluorinated amino acids are essential building blocks in the spheres of protein engineering and medicinal chemistry. In the last decades, a large number of different synthetic strategies have been developed to produce a large variety of fluorinated amino acids. Still, obtaining fluorinated amino acids in great quantities can be challenging, or the corresponding pathways are heavily time-consuming and synthetically challenging. In this context, chiral Ni(II) complexes can be powerful tools to obtain tailor‑made non‑canonical amino acids. In this work, we wanted to take advantage of this strategy and extend the range of this method to include additional fluorinated amino acids. We synthesized two fluorinated analogs of phenylalanine, which are still unexplored in the context of peptide and protein chemistry. Furthermore, both diastereomers of trifluoroleucine were synthesized, demonstrating that the described strategy can also be applied to synthesize enantio‑ and diastereomerically pure γ‑branched fluorinated amino acids. This work further underlines the importance of chiral Ni(II) complexes in the synthesis of fluorinated amino acids.",

The development of new chemical methods for bioconjugation is essential to generate ADCs and to optimize their stability, efficacy, and safety. Traditional conjugation methods often face challenges related to site-selectivity and heterogeneous product mixtures, highlighting the need to develop new, innovative chemical strategies. Photoredox chemistry emerges as a powerful tool in this context, enabling precise, mild, and selective modifications of peptides and proteins. By harnessing light to drive chemical transformations, photoredox techniques can facilitate the synthesis of antibody bioconjugates. This perspective will discuss the drive to develop and empower photoredox methods applied to antibody functionalization.",

In this paper, the asymmetric synthesis of β-amino cyanoesters with contiguous tetrasubstituted carbon stereogenic centers by the Mannich reaction through chiral halonium salt catalysis is presented, which provided the corresponding products in excellent yields with up to 86% ee.

In this study, we report the topochemical cycloaddition of diethyl 2,6-dichloro-1,7-dioxo-1H,7H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylate (Cl2B), initiated by visible light. Crystal structure analysis confirmed that the reactive double bonds are parallel and coplanar, in line with the Schmidt criteria for topochemical cycloaddition. Additionally, two other bimane derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and investigated. Our findings suggest that functionalizing bimanes to redshift their absorption maxima into the visible-light spectrum provides a promising strategy for synthesizing substituted cyclobutanes without the need for ultraviolet irradiation.",

    "abstract": "Diazocines are photoswitches derived from azobenzenes by bridging the two phenyl rings in ortho position with a CH2CH2 group forming an eight membered (diazocine) ring. Diazocine is superior to most azobenzenes in almost all photophysical properties (switching efficiency, quantum yield, wavelengths etc.). The biggest advantage, especially in photopharmacology and when used in photoswitchable materials, is the inverted thermodynamic stability of the two switching states (isomers). The Z isomer is more stable than the E form. However, one disadvantage that it shares with the frequently used azobenzene is that the switching efficiency decreases sharply with increasing water content in the solvent. In a recently published paper, we reported that replacing one CH2 group in the bridge with NCOCH3 not only confers intrinsic water solubility, but also largely eliminates the problem of reduced switching efficiency in aqueous solutions. In order to investigate the chemistry of this promising photoswitch and to unlock further applications, we now investigate strategies for the synthesis of derivatives, which are based on cross-coupling reactions. Fourteen vinyl-, aryl-, cyano-, and amino-substituted diazocines were prepared via Stille, Suzuki, and Buchwald–Hartwig reactions. X-ray structures are presented for derivatives 1, 2 and 7.",

The readily accessible key intermediates of preQ0 and DPQ0 (both bearing a nitrile moiety instead of the aminomethyl group) were reduced to the corresponding 7-formyl-7-deazapurine counterparts. These readily undergo reductive amination to form the hydroxyalkyl handles, which were further converted to the haloalkyl or mesyloxyalkyl-modified target compounds. In addition, we report hydrogenation conditions for preQ0 and DPQ0 that allow for cleaner and faster access to preQ1 compared to existing routes and provide the novel compound DPQ1.",

Herein, the first two‐step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase‐catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16 h using eco‐friendly t‐amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4 h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.",

In contrast, in the case of the 1,4‐diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron‐rich aromatic rings.

While (H)TPQs are typically non‐emissive and potentially open‐shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the π‐conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium‐containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena‐hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO‐LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia‐analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) and thiaradialene (1.58 × 10−3 cm2 · V−1 · s−1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low‐lying LUMO energy levels.",

The use of cage‐shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction.

At the same time, introducing deuterium into organic electronic materials helps to reduce high‐frequency molecular vibrations, thus broadening the range of applications of organic materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic components.\nSince the approval of the deuterated drug deutetrabenazine in 2017 and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light‐emitting diodes, multideuteration technologies have advanced considerably. Various strategies utilizing both rare and earth‐abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration have been reported. This review examines recently developed metal catalysts for multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges in deuteration methods, and explores future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.",

A DFT‐based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40 kcal·mol‐1, and in the triplet state, 1.47 kcal·mol‐1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is 589 times faster than in the ground state.",

In addition to reducing the total number of synthetic steps, efforts have been made to reduce hazardous reagents and simplify purification. Synthetic complexity index values for both established and newly reported methods are then generated in order to provide a qualitative evaluation of the reduced contribution of these common building blocks to the synthetic complexity of all materials that contain them.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, open‐cage fullerenes (i.e., fullerene derivatives featuring an orifice within their cage structure) have attracted significant attention across multiple research areas in materials, coordination, supramolecular, and biomolecular chemistry. However, the methodology available for the preparation of open‐cage fullerenes remains limited. Herein, it is discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps is initiated, resulting in the one‐step synthesis of the corresponding open‐cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology is confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open‐cage fullerenes and is expected to promote the widespread application of open‐cage fullerene derivatives.",

    "abstract": "In the last 20 years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem, it is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work. The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available d‐mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A density functional theory (DFT) theoretical study is carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer‐like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal‐like functional group at C‐1. All compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.",

The scope of the present tandem reaction is investigated to show that common amine protecting groups, such as Ts, Ns, Cbz, and Bz, are well tolerated. Addition of a catalytic amount of bismuth(III) triflate is required for promoting the intramolecular aza‐Michael addition where the N‐protected amino group is less nucleophilic. The stereochemical consequence of the present tandem reaction is found to be dependent on the amine protecting group.",

We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H‐pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]‐sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen–Hüttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H‐pyrazoles—another spirocyclic fused‐ring system with a highly contorted structure—or the thermodynamically favored 1H‐pyrazoles. The 1H‐pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]‐helicenes containing a phenanthro‐pyrazole fused to a dihydro‐cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon‐rich materials.",

    "abstract": "Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition‐metal‐catalyzed enantioselective 1,4‐additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc, or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation, and alkynylation reactions. Herein, the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4‐addition to challenging 4‐quinolones is reported, upon in situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal‐catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion‐binding catalysis using a chiral triazole‐based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2‐substituted 2,3‐dihydro‐4‐quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4‐amino and γ–amino alcohol derivatives by post‐functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (>99:1 e.r.), was showcased. The notable features of this protocol include its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance, and potential application toward the synthesis of chiral 2,3‐dihydro‐4‐quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.",

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3‐pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre‐activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3‐pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3‐pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre‐activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4‐difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4‐disubstituted 3‐pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3‐pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations.",

In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late‐stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUnspecific Peroxygenases have been the subject of a lot of research in the recent past as they offer opportunities for green hydroxylation reactions using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as donor. A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co‐substrate H2O2. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an l‐amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide in situ at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95%.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe skeleton editing strategy has emerged as a transformative approach in drug discovery and agrochemical innovation, enabling precise modifications through the insertion, elimination, or substitution of specific atoms within the core carbon‐ or heterocyclic frameworks of molecules. Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single‐carbon‐atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five‐membered carbon‐ and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six‐membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven‐membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo‐ and electro‐catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single‐carbon‐atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology.",

The resulting Bpin‐functionalized naphthalenes serve as versatile building blocks, facilitating further transformations of the C−B bond into C−H, C−C, C−I, C−O, and C−N bonds, thereby increasing molecular complexity and enabling the design of more functionalized products. Notably, this sustainable and straightforward protocol selectively introduces the Bpin group at the sterically hindered α‐carbon of the naphthalene framework, complementing C–H borylations of the naphthalene core, that preferentially occur at the β‐position. As a result, the developed approach significantly broadens the accessibility of B‐functionalized naphthalene derivatives for synthetic and application‐oriented purposes.",

This straightforward and efficient process combines the selective hydroiodination of internal alkynes, promoted by the eutectic mixture choline iodide (ChI)/p‐TsOH (1:1) under mild, bench‐type conditions (without the need for toxic molecular HI), with a subsequent sulfenylation step of the in situ‐generated vinyl iodides. This final step is compatible with aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic thiols. Notably, the methodology addresses a longstanding challenge by enabling the selective formation of Markovnikov products with Z‐configuration in the thiolation of secondary propiolamides. It also avoids volatile organic solvents and is easily scalable to gram quantities, offering significant advantages for synthetic applications.",

The protocol takes place upon irradiation of the reaction mixture in the presence of the decatungstate anion, which triggers C−H cleavage in the chosen aliphatic substrates. The photogenerated C‐centered radicals add regioselectively to the central C(sp)‐atom of the cumulenic structure, delivering an allyl‐type radical adduct that finally leads to the β‐substituted alkenoate ester of interest. When an aliphatic allenoate is adopted, the protocol leads to the selective formation of a β,γ‐alkenoate, while the corresponding phenyl ester delivers a mixture of β,γ‐ and α,β‐alkenoates. Rationalization of the observed regioselectivity is supported by computational work, which highlights how the steric demand of the allenoate ester at the radical adduct level determines the reaction outcome. The versatility of the protocol, which can also take place under (telescoped) flow conditions, is further demonstrated by the possibility to divert the reaction outcome toward the selective formation of β,γ‐ or α,β‐alkenoate esters by performing the photocatalyzed process alone or in combination with a subsequent base‐promoted C=C double bond migration, respectively.",

The designed catalyst features multiple active sites, including a Lewis acidic alkali ion center and a nucleophilic iodide source, enabling the efficient activation of epoxides under solvent‐free conditions with atmospheric pressure. Systematic studies on the effects of cations and calcium salts revealed that the multi‐activation mechanism plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic performance. The catalyst exhibited a high selectivity and activity, achieving up to a 97% yield of cyclic carbonates at atmospheric CO2 pressure and 70 °C. The simulated post‐combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used as the material for the reaction to yield 90% of styrene carbonate from styrene oxide. Furthermore, the catalyst was easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles without any significant loss of activity. This study provides a practical and environmentally‐friendly approach for CO2 utilization, contributing to the advancement of sustainable catalytic processes.",

This catalyst features a unique imine (−C=N) structure within the triazine ring and multiple coupled imine groups, which significantly enhances CO2 adsorption efficiency and exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. At ambient pressure and mild temperatures, Pd@POP‐1 effectively converts low‐concentration CO2 (less than 15 vol.%) into quinazolinones, even in the presence of SO2 (up to 428 mg/m3) and NO2 (up to 221 mg/m3), achieving high yields. Remarkably, Pd@POP‐1 also efficiently transforms CO2 from boiler flue gas, which contains 10 vol.% CO2, into quinazolinones with satisfactory yields. This approach not only provides an eco‐friendly alternative for quinazolinone production by replacing phosgene with actual flue gas as a carbon source but also represents a promising strategy for the resource utilization of CO2 in flue gas.",

Herein, we report a one‐pot, two‐step sequential deracemization of racemic sec‐alcohols to optically enriched primary amines throught a photo‐biocatalytic oxidation‐reductive amination linear cascade. In the first step, near‐to‐quantitative oxidation of a set of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols into prochiral ketones was accomplished using visible light photoredox catalysis relying on 440 nm blue LEDs irradiation, 9‐fluorenone as a transition‐metal‐free photocatalyst, and O2‐saturated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the reaction medium and a quencher of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The intermediary ketones were further converted into the corresponding non‐racemic amines with up to 99% conversion, high‐to‐excellent optical purity (90–99.9% ee), and complementary absolute configuration via a stereoselective reductive amination catalyzed by lyophilized E. coli cells containing the respective (R)‐ or (S)‐selective recombinant transaminases (E. coli/TAs) in an aqueous KPi buffer in the presence of pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate (PLP) as cofactor and isopropylamine (iPrNH2) as an amino group donor. The developed photo‐biocatalytic system was scaled up for racemic 1‐phenylethanol (1.0 mmol), furnishing (S)‐(−)‐1‐phenylethylamine with 91% conv., 82% isolated yield and 99% ee. An exemplary functionalization of the obtained (S)‐α‐methylbenzylamine with 6‐chloro‐3‐isopropylpyrimidine‐2,4(1H,3H)‐dione led to afford an enantiomerically enriched newly launched cardiac‐specific myosin inhibitor mavacamten in 76% yield and 99% ee. In addition, a single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed, furnishing the first crystal structure for the titled API.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHerein, we report that an efficient and practical organocatalyzed strategy enables direct amidation of a wide range of carboxylic acids and variety of amines. The organocatalyzed system is proved to be suitable for the synthesis of small molecular peptides from protected amino acids, and the method was successfully applied to the late stage functionalization of drug molecules or pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic studies by control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (11B NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, reveal that N‐propyl‐N‐(2‐(pyridin‐2‐ylamino)phenyl) formamide reacts with B2pin2 to form the N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC)‐diboron adduct, and the boron atom of NHC‐diboron adduct is able to coordinate to the carboxyl oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid to generate the true active species of NHC‐diboron‐carboxylic acid for catalyzing the amidation of carboxylic acids and amines. The discovery of in situ generation of catalytic system in combination of multi‐catalytic components with substrates may open the door to cooperative catalysis for the synthesis of important organic molecules.",

The methodology facilitates the synthesis of β‐aminothiocyanates through N−S bond cleavage, with over 30 examples exhibiting yields up to 88%. Mechanistic studies reveal a radical pathway involving the generation of thiocyanate and iminyl radical species. The resulting β‐aminothiocyanate serves as valuable building blocks for diverse transformations, particularly in the construction of SCN‐containing bioactive molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications.",

The use of cinchona derivatives as chiral proton catalysts demonstrates their potential beyond their conventional roles as base‐promoted and phase‐transfer catalysts. Competitive reaction pathways are explored using density functional theory (DFT), wavefunction theory, and microkinetic simulations. Theoretical analyses are complemented with experimental titration and kinetic techniques to verify the intrinsic details of the reaction. This study reveals an intricate hydrogen bond network formed in the rate‐ and selectivity‐determining step, involving four noncovalently attached components that favor a stronger substrate⋅⋅⋅catalyst interaction in the R transition state. Significantly, this research emphasizes the pivotal role of carboxylate anions as nucleophile‐activating bases impacting reaction yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, this work introduces cinchonium derivatives as new options for CPC and provides a thorough mechanistic analysis significant in expanding this underdeveloped catalytic domain.",

    "abstract": "This work comprises the synthesis and characterization of aminophosphine (PN)-derived Mn(I) carbonyl complexes and the preliminary investigation of their alkylated congeners for catalytic applications. The complexes fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3Br] are obtained from the reaction of Mn(CO)5Br with the bidentate ligand PN = R2N(CH2)2PR'2, where R = Me, Et, and pyrrolidine and R' = Ph, iPr, and Cy. Treatment of fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3Br] with AgOTf yields fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3OTf]. Upon reaction of fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3OTf] with MeLi (R' = alkyl) or MeMgCl (R' = aryl), fac-[Mn(PN)(CO)3Me] is formed. fac-[Mn(PCyNMe)(CO)3Me] and fac-[Mn(PPhNMe)(CO)3Me] are identified as the best catalysts for the dimerization of phenylacetylene and the hydroboration of 4-chlorostyrene, respectively.",

A subsequent one-electron reduction of 2 yielded the dicoordinate borylene (Me2-cAAC)BSi(SiMe3)3, 3, which rapidly underwent intramolecular C-H activation to give cyclo-(Me2-cAAC)B(H)Si(SiMe3)3, 4, irrespective of the employed reaction conditions. Compound 3 could be stabilized as the carbonyl complex (Me2-cAAC)B(CO)Si(SiMe3)3, 5, that gave 4 upon irradiation with a UV light under a CO2 atmosphere. In contrast, the two-electron reduction of 1 under an atmosphere of CO2 yielded a mixture of products of which (Me2-cAAC)B(Cl)(H)C(O)OSi(SiMe3)3, 6, could be separated and structurally characterized. Compound 6 is a rare example of CO2 insertion into a B-E (E = heavier main group element) bond in which boron functions as a nucleophile, thereby mimicking transition metal-mediated carboxylation. The mechanism for the formation of 6 from the purported boryl anion intermediate [(Me2-cAAC)B(Cl)Si(SiMe3)3]-, 2 -, was analyzed computationally.",

    "abstract": "The rate, site-selectivity, and product isomerization of the C(sp2)–H oxidative addition of arenes with pyridine(dicarbene) cobalt methyl and phenyl complexes have been investigated with four representative arenes of varying electronic and steric properties. The rates of C(sp2)–H activation to yield cobalt-aryl products and subsequent aryl isomerization were influenced by the electronic properties of the arene; the relatively electron-poor arene 3-fluorobenzotrifluoride underwent C(sp2)–H activation and isomerization of the cobalt-aryl more than 70 times faster than the more electron-rich substrate, 3-fluoro-N,N,α-trimethylbenzeneacetamide. In all cases, meta-to-fluorine C(sp2)–H oxidative addition was the major product at low conversion, which subsequently isomerized to the ortho isomer over time. Deuterium-labeling experiments and measurement of methane isotopologues establish that the major cobalt-aryl product at early conversion arises from kinetically preferred, meta-selective oxidative addition. Density functional theory calculations support pathways involving cobalt(I)–(III) redox cycles with oxidative addition to cobalt(I) occurring with a relatively high barrier followed by faster reductive elimination. Despite the strong σ-donating properties of the pyridine(dicarbene) pincer ligand, the π-accepting character of the carbene donors lowers the barrier for reductive elimination, and hence, cobalt(III) intermediates have not been observed.",

    "abstract": "Azole-, pyridine-, and pyrimidine-based cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors strongly bind to CYP enzymes through the coordination between the heme iron of CYP and the sp2-nitrogen atoms of heteroaromatic rings, providing potent pharmacological effects by inhibiting the initiation of the catalytic cycles of target CYP enzymes. Although imidazole-, 1,2,4-triazole-, pyridine-, and pyrimidine-based CYP inhibitors have been widely explored, 1,3-oxazole-based CYP inhibitors have received little attention. In this study, we designed and identified novel 1,3-oxazole-based inhibitors of cholesterol 24- hydroxylase (CH24H; CYP46A1), a brain-specific enzyme involved in cholesterol catabolism, to form 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Detailed insights into the CH24H-ligand interactions were provided by the crystal structures of 1,3-oxazole compounds, including high-throughput screening hit 2 and rationally designed inhibitor 3f. Optimization of 3f led to the identification of 1,3-oxazole derivative 4 l as a potent, selective, and brain-penetrable CH24H inhibitor that significantly reduced 24HC levels in the mouse brain. The design of 1,3-oxazole-based CYP inhibitors holds the potential for the discovery of novel inhibitors with significant potency against a broad spectrum of CYP enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less cytoplasmic structures that form in response to various stress stimuli and play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of SG dynamics has been implicated in several diseases, including neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions; however, their role in skin biology remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified pyridoxal hydrochloride, a form of vitamin B6, as a novel regulator of SG formation through a metabolite library screening. Our results demonstrate that pyridoxal hydrochloride significantly suppresses oxidative stress-induced SG formation in skin fibroblasts, exhibiting effects comparable to G3Ia, a known SG inhibitor. Furthermore, pyridoxal hydrochloride mitigates oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and preventing cell toxicity. Notably, it also attenuates ROS-induced upregulation of MMP-1, thereby preserving collagen-1 stability. These findings suggest the crucial role of SGs in skin fibroblast homeostasis and suggest that pyridoxal hydrochloride may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-related skin disorders.",

    "abstract": "A series of novel Mpro inhibitors was designed and synthesized to combat the coronavirus, such as HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, and several compounds showed comparable antiviral activity to nirmatrelvir. Among them, an octahydroindole-based peptidomimetic covalent inhibitor 28f showed strong inhibitory activity against Mpros and exhibited broad-spectrum anticoronavirus activity with EC50 values ranging from 0.027 to 4.41 μM. Besides, this compound displayed potent antiviral activity against EV71. Compared to FB2001, 28f displayed better pharmacokinetic properties, and the value of oral bioavailability in CD-1 mice and Beagle dogs was improved to 10.4 and 10.2%, respectively. In addition, oral treatment with 28f could significantly reduce the viral loads of HCoV-OC43 in mice, and compound 28f could also effectively reduce lung viral loads in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model without ritonavir. Taken together, compound 28f is a promising orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate that deserves further research.",

    "abstract": "The rational design of tumor-responsive prodrug nanoassemblies requires precise control over systemic stability and site-specific activation. While α-position disulfide bonds are advantageous for rapid response to redox conditions, they also risk premature drug leakage during circulation. This study introduces a steric hindrance-guided approach to engineer disulfide-bridged podophyllotoxin homodimeric prodrugs for spatiotemporal controlled delivery. By monomethyl or dimethyl substitution of the carbon atoms adjacent to the α-disulfide bond, we can modulate steric hindrance. Excessive hindrance destabilizes the nanoassemblies and slows effective drug release, while moderate hindrance (monomethyl modification) enhances pharmacokinetic properties and promotes selective tumor activation. In vivo studies indicate that monomethyl-modified prodrug nanoassemblies exhibit superior antitumor efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity compared to PPT solution. This work underscores the importance of steric hindrance in optimizing prodrug nanoassembly stability and tumor-specific activation, offering a comprehensive strategy for redox-responsive nanomedicines.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin system represents an attractive pharmacological target for numerous pathological processes, including cancer and neurodegeneration. RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute the largest class of ubiquitin enzymes, providing a scaffold for substrate recognition and catalysis. Their shallow groove recognition interfaces involving discontinuous epitopes and a lack of defined binding pockets have largely rendered them undruggable. Inspired by natural RING inhibitors, we have developed a pharmacophore-based strategy for the rational design of peptidomimetics targeting RING domains, and we demonstrate its feasibility by using the macromolecular APC/C complex (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome). We designed scaffolds binding to the APC/C RING domain and efficiently inhibiting its activity in vitro. Iterative structure-based design and experimental studies to optimize their chemical stability, permeability, and specificity lead to new hydrocarbon-stapled-based molecules inhibiting APC/C in vitro and in cancer cells. Our results provide a robust rationale for targeting RING-containing enzymes of therapeutic value and promising leads for clinical APC/C inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Radioligands with albumin-binding moieties exhibit a great potential for the treatment of tumor diseases owing to the general finding of an increased integral tumor uptake compared to radioligands without such moieties. However, the reasons for this pharmacokinetic behavior are less explored. Herein, we focused on identifying potential mechanisms for our previously developed heterobivalent (SST2/albumin) [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-cLAB-TATEs. For this purpose, we designed two novel derivatives that show either negligible binding to albumin or lack the SST2-targeting capability. Based on the in vivo results, we hypothesize that binding of the albumin-bound radioligand to SST2 in addition to that of the free radioligand causes the increased tumor uptake. This is supported by saturation binding analyses in the presence of albumin and compartment modeling considerations. Overall, the results of this study provide a first tentative explanation for the phenomenon of increased tumor uptake for albumin-binding radioligands, which may support the prospective design of such radioligands.",

Notably, hexahydroazepino[3,4-b]indole derivative D2 exhibited favorable oral bioavailability (F = 47.13%) and potent antifungal activity both in vitro and in vivo, making it a promising oral antifungal candidate for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. Furthermore, we employed affinity-based protein profiling to identify the potential targets of the carboline derivatives. Proteomic analysis of a photoaffinity probe revealed that the SET domain-containing protein was the potential target. Taken together, this study provides a promising lead compound and potential drug target for future antifungal drug development.",

While small-molecule soaking can advance inhibitor development, the selectivity pocket is absent in available Sirt2 apo structures, and existing soaking systems like Sirt2-ADPribose (ADPR) suffer from unfavorable crystal packing that hinders ligand binding. We developed a method to rapidly generate high-quality Sirt2 apo crystals with an open selectivity pocket, suitable for high-throughput soaking. The induced-fit pocket forms upon seeding with a Sirtuin Rearranging ligand (SirReal) and is retained in the ligand-free apo structure. Screening the Maybridge Ro3-fragment library using a fluorescence polarization assay yielded three novel Sirt2-fragment-inhibitor structures. Additionally, our Sirt2 apo crystals can accommodate ligands at the acyl-lysine channel entrance and the cofactor binding site, as confirmed by binding of the peptide inhibitor KT9 and NAD+, facilitating SAR studies and inhibitor optimization.",

Herein, we designed a small-molecule STING inhibitor and STING mutant-specific degrader by binding two coupled pockets of a STING dimer. Structure optimization selected SI-24, SI-42, and SI-43 with low nanomolar activity to inhibit 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-induced STING activation and release of IFN-β and CXCL-10, which were far more potent than reported STING inhibitors. Moreover, the three lead compounds suppressed cGAMP-induced oligomerization of STING and phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and STING. Surprisingly, SI-43 promoted mutant-specific and proteasome-independent degradation of STINGS154 and STINGM155. Subcutaneous or oral administration of SI-24, SI-42, and SI-43 reduced serum IFN-β and CXCL-10 in the cGAMP-induced autoimmune disease mouse model. Our dual-functional compounds provide a new strategy to investigate STING function through both inhibition and mutant-specific degradation in autoimmune diseases.",

Molecular docking analysis, CETSA, and BLI confirmed its strong HDAC6 binding. Moreover, 38k displayed robust in vitro and in vivo antiesophageal cancer efficacy, along with an advantageous pharmacokinetic and safety profile. Notably, combining 38k with a PI3K inhibitor synergistically enhanced the efficacy (75.02% tumor growth inhibition vs 50.94% monotherapy), likely by counteracting HDAC6 inhibition-induced PI3K/AKT activation. These findings validate HDAC6 as a therapeutic target and highlight 38k as a promising candidate for esophageal cancer treatment, particularly in combination regimens.",

Mutagenesis studies elucidated relevant interactions of compound 16 at CMKLR1 residues Y6.51 and L7.35 as well as F7.31, S7.32, and T7.39 forming the binding pocket. Based on active CMKLR1/chemerin-9 structures and the inactive AlphaFold model, in silico docking was performed in the inactive model, with compound 16 most likely binding orthosterically. Considering the sequence similarity of CMKLR1 and GPR1, compound 16 was docked to GPR1, indicating a similar binding. At GPR1, compound 16 showed a slightly lower effect on chemerin-9-mediated arrestin recruitment and internalization.",

Dual-acting agents (i.e., compound LP-65) were synthesized displaying high in vitro inhibition of both MEK (IC50 = 83.2 nM) and mTOR (IC50 = 40.5 nM). Additionally, compound LP-65 demonstrated significant modulation of MEK and mTOR signaling activity in human glioma cells (D54) and human melanoma cells (A375), with a corresponding decrease in cellular proliferation and migration.

These nanoparticles specifically target SiHa tumor cells. Upon light irradiation, Ru3ApNPs increase intracellular ROS levels, catalyze NADH redox reactions, and induce lysosomal disruption, ultimately triggering pyroptosis in tumor cells. Notably, Ru3ApNPs demonstrate excellent tumor penetration in 3D multicellular spheroids (MCSs) of SiHa cells and effectively inhibit their growth under light exposure. Ru3ApNPs exhibit a mechanism of action distinct from that of traditional PDT. Furthermore, under light irradiation, Ru3ApNPs can effectively inhibit the growth of distant tumors and induce systemic immune responses in mice.

A set of pyridine-containing structures attained high cellular potencies (EC50 1 nM), while a complementary set of pyrrolotriazine-containing molecules balanced cellular potency with desirable physicochemical properties. Lead molecules from both subseries demonstrated in vivo XPO1 engagement, were efficacious in a mouse model of graft versus host disease, and showed superior tolerability to Selinexor.

However, the rapid crystallization of Sn‐Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual‐anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high‐quality MA‐free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent‐free spin‐coating process. Acetate anions (Ac−) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac− and thiocyanate anions (SCN−) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual‐anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non‐radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single‐junction Sn‐Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn‐Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all‐perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.",

For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long‐circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein‐resistant yet cell membrane‐binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell‐membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N‐alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N‐alkyl chain became cell membrane‐philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)‐loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple‐negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor‐active drug delivery carriers.",

Here, elemental iodine (I2) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine‐rich condition and to transform into I− ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well‐crystallized perovskite with vertically‐aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep‐red (678 nm) and pure‐red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and  transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon‐conducting ceramics offer a low‐density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4 W m−1 K−1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi‐generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low‐loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m−1 K−1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post‐processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly‐lactic acid  matrix from surface‐modified boron nitride platelets, creating a “hetero‐percolated network”. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAqueous solutions of nanoparticles are the cornerstones for applications in diagnostics, catalysis and more, where control over the nanoparticle's dispersion is pivotal to tailoring the final product properties. Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono‐disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra‐dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room‐temperature structural transformation‐induced in situ core‐shell self‐assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre‐core‐shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit >80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential >80 mV) even after >10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single‐photon emission with g(2)(0) M is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon‐based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium‐ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide‐based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double‐layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of π‐conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub‐graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon‐like large π‐conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen‐free edge C(sp2)–H sites, and well‐defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g−1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g−1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid‐state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)‐vacancies (O‐LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐based CPEs (PEO@O‐LZO). The O‐LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O‐vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O‐vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O‐LZO at 40 °C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O‐LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40 °C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency.

With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off‐target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic‐based Calibrated 5‐ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non‐pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5‐ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia‐inducible promoter regulating O‐acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post‐treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor‐specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5‐ALA‐based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor‐targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.",

However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell‐proliferation‐related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7‐targeting chimera (AP‐CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein‐targeting aptamer with a mutant‐CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP‐CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP‐CRTAC constructed with a 2′ F‐pyrimidine‐modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP‐CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR‐targeted therapies, to the third‐generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid–liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high‐energy‐density flexible lithium‐ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid‐phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid‐phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of >99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high‐voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm−2, high volumetric energy density of 500 Wh L−1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0 mm.

This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro‐level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular‐oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state‐of‐the‐art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the “oxidant‐catalyst‐pollutants” internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC‐AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting‐edge laboratory devices and pilot‐scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs‐AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided.

Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but existing photocatalysts often suffer from modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co‐activation, such as Mg‐activated water or non‐sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon‐nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox‐flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.",

Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN‐F, phCN‐Cl, 2phCN‐F, and 2phCN‐Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene‐substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN‐F‐based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN‐F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85°C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability.

    "abstract": "AbstractInorganic hydrogels have great potential in many applications as sustainable materials, but lack flexibility due to rigid network structures. Here, a novel strategy is proposed—an inorganic polymer hydrogel, prepared by crosslinking long‐chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+), which effectively address the rigidity and fragility issues commonly associated with traditional inorganic gels. With the most stable hydration shell among those ions, Ni2+ tends to interact indirectly with LPP through hydrogen bonds rather than coordination bonds. The unique Ni2+‐phosphate interaction endows the Ni‐LPP hydrogels with ultrahigh elongation at break (≈15 000×). Further experiments reveal that the Ni2+‐phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor. The highly extensible, good conductive (1.06 ± 0.08 S m−1), self‐healing (within 30 s and without stimulation), arbitrarily shapeable, and nonflammable Ni‐LPP inorganic hydrogel indicates a bright future in flexible electronics, environmental remediation, and beyond.",

    "abstract": "AbstractObesity‐induced insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, and chronic low‐grade inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance through the activation of tissue‐infiltrating immune cells. Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity‐related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light‐responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual‐targeting and multiple‐signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1‐like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low‐grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs‐mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long‐term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light‐sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLi‐rich Mn‐based layered (LMR) cathodes with anionic redox chemistry show great potential for next‐generation sustainable Li‐ion battery (LIB) applications due to the low cost and high energy density. However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order–disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25 V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order–disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li‐rich cathode materials through a dedicated order–disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage.",

However, most multifunctional hydrogel sensors are prone to water loss and become useless e‐waste, resulting in a growing threat to the global environment and human health. Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self‐healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200 ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real‐time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R‐TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote‐controlling platforms, paving the way for large‐scale, multi‐scenario applications.",

However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four‐electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy‐saving H₂ production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high‐value‐added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure–performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research.",

The need for enhanced contrast through improved tumor‐to‐background ratio (TBR) and the toxicity from repeated injections due to fading fluorescent signals further complicate the issue. Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface‐stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image‐guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin‐conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR ∼ 2), while enabling prolonged 3‐day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation. This innovative method offers substantial improvements over existing fluorescent contrast agents and holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer surgery.",

Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O2, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using solid oxidants offer a promising approach for decentralized freshwater production but are often limited by nonselective radical reactions that degrade both pollutants and background water constituents. Here, sonicated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate are demonstrated, enabling selective contaminant degradation via dual nonradical pathways—singlet oxygen oxidation and direct electron transfer. Optimized sonication introduces catalytically active carbonyl (C═O) groups on CNT surfaces while preserving their graphitic structure, ensuring rapid electron transfer. This approach achieves 2,4‐dichlorophenol removal, a common industrial and municipal pollutant, within 5 min at a record removal rate of 4.80 µmol g−1 s−1. Furthermore, scalable CNT catalyst synthesis and integration into flat membrane and hollow fiber filtration devices, ensuring long‐term stability and efficient pollutant removal in natural river water, are demonstrated.

However, linking atomic positions in nanomaterials to their functional properties is challenging due to their polydispersity. This study utilizes nano test tubes to uncover distinct phases of selenium, an elemental semiconductor, demonstrating a remarkable structural plasticity between 0.4 and 3.0 nm. These structures are correlated with their electronic bandgaps, ranging from 2.2 to 2.5 eV, using ultra‐low‐loss electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy for individual nanowires in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Notably, the variation in bandgaps diverges from that of bulk selenium and is non‐monotonic on the host‐nanotube diameter, indicating that conformational distortions in selenium chains begin counteracting quantum confinement effects at sub‐nm scales. A 1D phase diagram predicting selenium's atomic structure based on nanotube diameter, regardless of the chemistry of the host nanotube is developed, which can be BNNT or carbon nanotubes. Phase changes in selenium nanowires are imaged in real‐time by transmission electron microscopy using BNNT as a test tube with an adjustable diameter.

It reestablishes the resting potential during host rest and generates real‐time biofeedback action potential during host movement. Further, it activates the “mechano‐electro‐biochemical” cascade effect for accelerating the repair of CSBDs. The bio‐ES generated from PPCs‐TENG enriches extracellular osteogenesis‐related biochemical factors at the CSBD site. It also activates the intracellular mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, thereby promoting calcium signaling and intracellular mechano‐transduction pathways. This activation enhances the proliferation and migration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs.

As a proof‐of‐concept application relevant to humanoid robotics and prosthetics, an automated surface‐texture‐recognition system is constructed by integrating the PT sensor with machine‐learning algorithms, a prosthetic device, an industrial robot arm, and a graphical user interface. This artificial sensory system demonstrates the ability to learn distinct object features, differentiate fine surface textures, and subsequently classify unknown textiles with high recognition accuracy (>98.9%) across a wide range of scanning speeds (50–300 mm s−1).

To address these, biomimetic bacterial outer membrane nanoparticles (BM‐NPs) are designed by integrating the precise targeting capability of detoxified outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) with the efficient drug‐loading properties of liposomes. BM‐NPs exhibit superior targeting efficiency toward peripheral neutrophils and macrophages, enabling spatiotemporal drug delivery via immune cells.

This strategy aligns with the dynamic pathological progression of SCI, offering precision targeting tailored to different stages of injury. BM‐NPs demonstrate multifaceted therapeutic effects, including the suppression of foam cell formation through coordinated enhancement of lipid droplet autophagy and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, they modulate the inflammatory microenvironment, preserve myelin integrity, and significantly promote neural functional recovery post‐SCI. By overcoming the limitations of conventional delivery systems in targeting and timeliness, BM‐NPs offer an innovative, highly efficient, and clinically translatable platform for SCI treatment and other acute inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConductive poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are potential bioelectronic interface materials because of their favorable mechanical properties and tunable electrochemical performances. Owing to intrinsic core‐shell colloidal microstructure composed of insulative phase and conductive phase, inducing phase separation via diverse methods are proposed to improve their performances. However, fabrication of high‐performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via a simple, mild strategy remains challenges. Here, we report a straightforward strategy to yield high‐performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via the formation of semipermeable membrane‐mediated hydrogen bonding interface. In this method, ethanol‐attracted PSS is free to accumulate at the man‐made interface provided by the semipermeable membrane, to realize controllable hierarchical PEDOT and PSS two‐phase distribution. The separated PEDOT aggregates via π–π conjugation, followed by the removal of rearranged insulative PSS phase easily, to form PEDOT:PSS hydrogels with satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical performances. This work presents a universal, effective, and controlled strategy to design conductive hydrogels for bioelectronic applications.",

However, the formidable challenge persists in coupling electric order and strong photoactivity through precise molecular design, hindering their further application in the field of optoelectronic memory. Herein, the molecular dynamics of aromatic cations in the 2D constrained environments are customized to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics, (4‐tert‐butylbenzylammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3I10, showing a narrow bandgap (≈1.96 eV) and strong visible‐photosensitivity. Notably, multi‐level dynamic states of aromatic cations provide the impetus for inducing ferroelectric order and photo‐ferroelectric effects. Such captivating characteristics can achieve light‐induced multiple polarization, dielectric, and conductivity states. Accordingly, photoferroelectrics are integrated into heterojunction phototransistors that display robust electrical and optical modulation, including diversified synaptic plasticity with low optical program power (≈20 pJ) for each training process. As a noteworthy advancement in the photoferroelectric field, this work will enrich the understanding of the structure‐property relationship and shed light on further exploration toward neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHierarchical architectures spanning multiple length scales are ubiquitous in biological tissues, conferring them with both mechanical robustness and dynamic functionalities via structural reorganization under loads. The design of hierarchical architectures within synthetic hydrogels to concurrently achieve mechanical reinforcement and functional integration remains challenging. Here, a biomimetic hierarchical engineering approach is reported to develop mechanically robust and function‐customizable supramolecular hydrogels by utilizing strong yet dynamic fibrous nanoarchitectures of amphiphilic peptides as crosslinkers. This design, on one hand, resolves the strength‐toughness trade‐off in hydrogel design through energy‐dissipative mechanisms involving dynamic detachment and reinsertion of peptides within their assembled nanostructures upon loading. On the other hand, the amphiphilicity and sequence programmability of peptides allow spatially orthogonal integration of multiple dynamic functionalities across distinct structural domains, including lipophilic fluorophore encapsulation, photopatterning capability, and anisotropic contraction. Capitalizing on its ultralow hysteresis and rapid recovery properties, the hydrogel's effectiveness is demonstrated as high‐sensitivity strain sensors. Moreover, the fully noncovalent crosslinking strategy permits closed‐loop recycling and reprocessing via reversible crosslinker disassembly‐reassembly processes. Through systematic extension of this principle across diverse peptide systems, a generalized platform is demonstrated for creating advanced soft materials that synergistically integrate traditionally incompatible attributes of mechanical robustness, customable dynamic functionality, and environmental sustainability.",

Here, an integrated programmable wire metamaterial is developed that enables programmable autonomy and dual‐band compatibility for non‐interference visible and self‐adaptive IR camouflage. This system allows automatic and intelligent concealment of targets in complex and dynamic thermal environments without human intervention. The self‐adaptive IR camouflage is facilitated by the manipulation of the metamaterial's tilt angle for continuous tunability of emissivity, which is attributed to the tilt angle‐dependent broadband impedance matching mechanisms. Equipped with programmable feedback algorithm commands, the integrated system dynamically adapts to varying thermal backgrounds, achieving apparent temperature modulation of up to 27 °C (ranging from 14 to 41 °C) while minimizing thermal imaging contrast to within 1 °C. These capabilities ensure that the target remains undetected by both visible and thermal detectors throughout the day.

Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton‐conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi0.7Co0.3O3–δ (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy‐rich praseodymium oxide (PrOx) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrOx introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d‐band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm−2 at 600 °C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm−2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 Ω cm2). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.",

Here, a unique carbon‐coated iron sulfide composite with abundant S vacancies (v‐FeS2@C) is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift the p‐band center (ɛ\np) of S and then decouple it from the d‐band center (ɛd) of Fe, which weakens Fe─S bond and strengthens Na─S interaction.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), with their inherently high redox potentials and open frameworks, are promising candidates. However, further boosting their redox potential and understanding their NH4+ ion storage mechanisms remain critical challenges. In this work, a novel ligand field‐induced dual active sites mechanism is introduced by incorporating Ni into the PBA framework, activating Ni as an additional redox center for NH4+ ion storage. The electron transfer from Ni to Fe within the Ni─N≡C─Fe chain enhances the redox potential and electrochemical performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF). For the first time, the electrochemical activity of Ni is demonstrated in NiHCF during NH4+ ions intercalation and de‐intercalation. NiHCF exhibits elevated redox potentials, superior rate performance, and robust cycling stability compared to iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). Advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations confirm the activation of Ni and the enhanced interaction between NH4+ ions and the framework. These findings provide new insights into the NH4+ ion storage mechanism of PBAs and offer a promising strategy for designing high‐energy‐density cathode materials for AIBs.",

Hydrogel modulation shows that stiffness, degradation, three‐dimensional embedding, and HA itself are key parameters that enhance PDTE maintenance ex vivo.

Here an antimony halide hybrid material with the formula of (C₄H₁₂N₂)₅[(SbCl₅)₂(SbCl₆)Cl₄] (Py‐SbCl) is shown with crystallographically independent alternating square pyramidal [SbCl₅] and octahedral [SbCl₆] sites sandwiched by organic layers. Interestingly, the octahedral site of the [SbCl₆] can be fully replaced by the In3+ ions, forming the alloyed compound (C₄H₁₂N₂)₅[(SbCl₅)₂(InCl₆)Cl₄] (Py‐SbInCl). More importantly, the latter shows a near‐unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which is ≈7 times of enhancement compared to the pristine Py‐SbCl compound. This is mainly due to the much‐enhanced Young's modulus, higher radiative decay rates and longer electron transient rates, presumably stemming from shorter In─Cl bond distances and higher dipole moments, as revealed by a cocktail study of X‐ray single‐crystal crystallography, density functional theory, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and so on. In addition, it is shown that Py‐SbInCl is an excellent yellow phosphor that can be used for white light‐emitting diodes and other applications such as counterfeiting. Therefore, making site‐specific alloying compounds may open a new design approach for functional bimetallic hybrid materials.",

Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst combining Pt single‐atoms and Pt nanoparticles on the etched boron nitride (eBN) coated carbon nanotube (Pt‐eBN@CNT) is synthesized, where both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps are promoted by the synergistic adsorption of the composite active sites and the electron‐withdrawing effect of eBN carrier, respectively. The proposed catalyst shows impressive performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 25.1 ± 1.7 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and a TOF of 17.1 ± 1.3 s−1 at 0.15 V vs RHE under extremely low metal loading of 6 µgPt cm−2 (catalyst loading of 0.77 mg cm−2), significantly better than those for the commercial benchmark Pt/C (44.2 ± 4.1 mV, 0.9 ± 0.1 s−1 at catalyst loading of 0.77 mg cm−2; 156.1 ± 0.6 mV, 1.6 ± 0.1 s−1 at metal loading of 6 µgPt cm−2) under the same conditions. Moreover, a membrane‐electrode‐assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with Pt‐eBN@CNT as the cathodic catalyst exhibits a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) of 2.0 × 106 C·cm−2 within high‐temperature electrocatalysis at 1.0 A·cm−2, significantly higher than those of state‐of‐the‐art Pt‐based electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates the important role of active‐site combination coupled with carrier effect in optimizing the kinetics of multi‐step electrocatalytic reaction.",

However, achieving controlled analyte release under nonthermal stimuli remains a major challenge. Here, a relay‐type solid‐state host–guest system based on a fluorinated pillararene derivative, EtFLP6, is presented, which enables selective adsorption of 1‐/2‐bromoalkane isomers, room‐temperature‐controlled desorption, and turn‐on colorimetric sensing. Activated EtFLP6 crystals selectively adsorb 1‐bromoalkanes from mixtures of 1‐/2‐positional isomers and release them at room temperature upon introduction of electron‐deficient aromatic acceptors (4‐nitrobenzonitrile and 1,5‐difluoro‐2,4‐dinitrobenzene), triggering a distinct color change from colorless to orange. Single‐crystal structures incorporating X‐ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal that the desorption and color change result from the disassembly of solid‐state host–guest complexes, driven by competitive binding with acceptors. This process is governed by the dynamic intermolecular interactions and selective molecular recognition of EtFLP6 in the solid state. This work bridges traditional macrocyclic adsorbents with functional organic cocrystals, offering a novel strategy for designing intelligent supramolecular materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnergy consumption for buildings and space thermal regulation account for ∼20% of global electricity usage. One of the key measures to alleviate such energy consumption is functionalizing windows to enhance energy generation and reduce temperature regulation expenditures. However, versatile windows that integrate both energy harvesting and temperature regulation remain scarce. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), which are large‐area photon‐harvesting devices, have demonstrated notable advantages as photovoltaic windows due to their building compatibility, but their potential for temperature regulation is generally overlooked. In this work, temperature‐regulated LSCs (TRLSCs) are prepared through high mid‐infrared (MIR) emissive perovskite‐polymer luminescent films and low‐MIR‐emissive transparent electrodes. TRLSCs not only enable favorable photovoltaic performance but also facilitate temperature regulation by tunable radiative cooling and self‐powered heating. Compared to conventional glass, the internal temperature is reduced by up to 12.0 °C via TRLSCs. Utilizing the competitive absorption between luminescent films and transparent electrodes, the cooling range can be conveniently modulated from 5.5–12.0 °C to 3.9–7.9 °C by flipping the TRLSCs, enabling adaptive thermal management. What is more, self‐powered thermal regulation is also achieved by transparent electrodes of TRLSCs for active heating. This work demonstrates the promising future of TRLSCs in functionalized windows and zero‐energy buildings.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChronic diabetic wounds persist as a clinical healthcare challenge. In the hyperglycemic pathological milieu, excessive inflammation, peripheral neuropathy, and vascular disorders impede diabetic wound healing. Immunoregulation is substantially emphasized among these factors; however, research on neurovascular regeneration remains insufficient. Endogenous electric fields (EFs) can regulate cellular behaviors and significantly impact the wound healing process. Herein, a conductive composite hydrogel (CGGP) with ultrasound‐responsive electrical stimulation based on interfacial ion/electron transfer for diabetic wound electrotherapy is proposed. CGGP is synthesized through physicochemical crosslinking of gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) dual networks and incorporated with curcumin‐loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The conductivity of CGGP is comparable to that of skin. Notably, CGGP can generate electrical stimulation based on ion transfer at the fluid–solid interface (electrokinetic effects) and electron transfer at the curcumin‐rGO interface in response to ultrasound. Moreover, CGGP exhibits an ultrasound‐responsive release of curcumin for anti‐inflammatory treatment. The ultrasound‐responsive CGGP can promote the secretion of neurotrophic factors, vessel formation, and fibroblast migration. Furthermore, it facilitates local nerve regeneration, angiogenesis, and matrix remodeling in diabetic rat models, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing. The sonoelectrical CGGP composite hydrogel holds great potential as a promising material for diabetic wound treatment.",

Here, field‐free SOT switching is demonstrated at sub‐nanosecond timescales in a PtTe2/WTe2/CoFeB heterostructure that fulfills all above requirements. The unique combination of WTe2, with its low crystal symmetry, facilitates field‐free SOT switching at reduced current densities, while PtTe2, characterized by its high spin Hall conductivity, enhances energy efficiency. Moreover, the significant in‐plane spin Hall conductivity from PtTe2 contributes to shortening the incubation delay.

Experimental investigation, theoretical calculation, and in situ analysis cooperatively reveal that the “sesame ball”‐like WO3/SnO2 spontaneously generates an internal electric field across the heterointerface, which offers moderate adsorption but rapid diffusion and accelerated conversion towards polysulfides. Meanwhile, the rich heterointerface acting as profitable nucleation sites guides the 3D growth of sulfide and thus impedes the inactivation of catalytic surface. As a consequence, the polysulfides shuttling is greatly restrained and highly reversible Li–S chemistry is constructed. Impressively, the unique heterojunction design endows a long‐term cycling capability up to 1000 cycles at 2C, illustrating its highly efficient and long‐lived catalysis capability.",

Herein, an innovative upcycling strategy is demonstrated that transforms mixed spent LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiMn2O4 cathodes into high‐performance cathode materials. Through advanced methodologies for reaction pathway control and rational design of metal coordination complexes, spent lithium‐ion batteries are recovered and converted into a solid solution characterized by homogeneously distributed manganese and iron elements. The regenerated LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4 cathode material, fabricated using this solid solution as a precursor, delivers a remarkable discharge capacity of 160.7 mA g−1 at 0.2C and retains an impressive 93.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1C. The LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4 (3.85 V vs Li+/Li and 558.9 Wh kg−1) achieves a significant voltage increase of 0.49 V and a 19.7% enhancement in energy density compared to commercial LFP (3.36 V vs Li+/Li and 466.8 Wh kg−1).

Early diagnosis of chemotherapy‐induced liver injury (CILI) is critical to prevent its progression into other liver diseases and potential liver failure. However, there is currently a lack of effective tools for early monitoring of CILI. To address this issue, it is developed a glutathione (GSH)‐activated ratiometric second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) nano‐probe, HCy‐CL‐RENPs, which utilizes rare earth ions‐doped nanoparticles (RENPs) as the luminescence signal reporters and hemicyanine dye HCy‐CL as the recognition unit to react with GSH, thereby modulating the NIR‐IIb emission of RENPs. This probe exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for detecting GSH, along with excellent biocompatibility. Utilizing HCy‐CL‐RENPs, it is accurately evaluated the hepatotoxicity of different chemotherapy drugs and successfully detected CILI within 5 h after drug administration, significantly earlier than existing methods such as serum enzyme detection and biopsy. These findings indicate that the probe can facilitate early assessment of liver injury by monitoring changes in GSH levels, providing a robust tool for the early diagnosis of CILI and guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

Occurrence of such UAHE is mainly attributed to the reciprocal () topology (i.e., the presence of topological Weyl points at/near the Fermi level), along with some contribution from the topological magnetic texture (at low temperatures), as inferred from the measured field‐dependent ac susceptibility. The effect of UAHE on the measured transport behavior however evolves differently with temperature above and below TC = 53 K, suggesting different physical mechanism responsible in the two phases. A unique planar ferrimagnetic ordering is found to be the most stable state with ab‐plane as the easy plane below TC. The simulated net magnetization and the moment per Co atom agrees fairly well with the experimentally measured values. A reasonably large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is also observed in both the phases (above and below TC) of the present compound, which is again not so ubiquitous.

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping single‐atom nanozymes with optimized ligand structures and multienzyme activities for self‐adaptive infected wound therapy presents a major challenge. Herein, single‐atom carbon dots with CuO4 coordination environment (Cu‐SLCDs) and CuN4 coordination environment (CuN‐CDs) are prepared, respectively. Both materials exhibit multienzyme‐like (oxidase‐, peroxidase‐, superoxide dismutase‐, catalase‐like) activities, with Cu‐SLCDs showing higher activity levels. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that, compared to CuN‐CDs, the polyphenol p‐π conjugated structure creates a unique electron‐donating coordination environment, which increases the electron density of Cu‐SLCDs at the Fermi level, enhances electron transfer, and boosts multienzyme‐like activities. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Cu‐SLCDs effectively eliminate over 98.6% of bacteria at a concentration of 25 µg mL−1, while reducing reactive oxygen species levels in normal cells to promoting efficient wound healing. The development of Cu‐SLCDs with optimized CuO4 coordination environment provides a novel approach for infected wound therapy and broadens the potential applications of single‐atom nanozymes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the accelerating depletion of fossil fuels, biomass energy has garnered significant attention as a promising renewable energy source. The electrocatalytic conversion of biomass into high‐value‐added products holds substantial research significance. In this study, the catalyst structure is systematically optimized by fine‐tuning the ratio of adjacent transition metals, nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu), leading to the design of an ultrathin‐layered nanosheet array catalyst, Cu1/8‐NiO@NF. This catalyst exhibits exceptional performance in the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The catalyst shows excellent stability over 40 HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) cycles at a relatively low electrolysis potential of 1.45 V (vs RHE). In a single cycle, the catalyst achieves complete conversion of HMF with 99.5% FDCA yield, 99.6% Faraday efficiency (FE), and nearly complete HMF conversion. A series of electrochemical tests reveals that the incorporation of Cu not only accelerates the formation of NiOOH reactive intermediates but also enhances the charge transfer process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that local substitution of Cu improved HMF adsorption and lowered the reaction energy barrier. This study provides a facile approach for developing efficient electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLithium metal is environmentally sensitive and highly reactive, especially when coupled with flammable organic electrolytes, which pose critical safety challenges for lithium metal batteries under harsh operational conditions. This study tackles this challenge by constructing an integrated strategy for encapsulating lithium metal with a multifunctional polyfluoride ionogel (PFIGE) through in situ thermal polymerization. Based on the cross‐linking network design of hexafluorobutyl methacrylate monomer and 1‐butyl‐3‐lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid plasticizer, C−F group and TFSI− anion cooperate to confer excellent water/oxygen barrier properties of the PFIGE. Meanwhile, the fluorinated skeleton optimizes the Li+ flux by regulating anion migration, thereby promoting the formation of stable inorganic‐rich interphases and achieving homogeneous lithium deposition. Additionally, the C−F group forms ion−dipole interactions with imidazole cations to achieve dynamic self‐healing capabilities, while the condensed‐phase physical barrier and gas‐phase radical scavenging effect of the pyrolyzed PFIGE synergistically contribute to the battery safety. As a proof‐of‐concept, PFIGE‐integrated Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells demonstrate extended cycling stability at high voltage (4.6 V) and high temperature (80 °C), and a 0.4 Ah‐level pouch cell exhibits exceptional resistance to thermal runaway under mechanical/electrical/thermal abuse conditions.

An in‐depth understanding of how molecular configurations affect electronic heterogeneity is still lacking, posing a challenge to interface optimization design. This work presents an effective interface control strategy aimed at achieving spatial homogenization of electronic properties. Using two isomeric D‐π‐A molecules, namely 2‐amino‐nicotinamide and 6‐amino‐nicotinamide, the spatial conformations of the nicotinamide molecules are modulated to achieve different adsorption orientations. Via synergistic intermolecular interactions, facilitating flexible multi‐site adsorption strengthened interactions with the perovskite, promoting uniform redistribution of surface charges, thereby reducing spatial electronic heterogeneity, facilitating energy level alignment, and suppressing nonradiative recombination at the perovskite surface. As a result, blade‐coated perovskite solar cells with a bandgap of 1.67 eV achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.0%. This strategy is expected to play a pivotal role in overcoming existing performance bottlenecks and pushing perovskite solar cells closer to their theoretical efficiency limits.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe molecular weight of conjugated polymers profoundly influences organic solar cell (OSC) efficiency, yet the structural mechanisms driving this relationship remain unresolved. Here, it is demonstrated that polymer conformation, governed by backbone rigidity and persistence length, is the critical determinant of molecular weight dependent performance in bulk‐heterojunction OSCs. By analyzing the benchmark polymers PM6 and D18, opposing trends is uncovered: PM6 achieves peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.11% at low number‐average molecular weight (Mn∼51 kDa), 18.47% at medium‐Mn (68 kDa), and declining to 16.83% at high Mn (122 kDa), whereas D18 improves from 16.87% (41 kDa) to 17.75% (67 kDa) and 19.15% (83 kDa). Neutron scattering and computational modeling reveal that D18's bulky 2‐butyloctyl side chains impose high rotational barriers, stiffening the backbone and extending its persistence length. This rigidity enables high‐Mn D18 to form ordered crystalline domains that enhance charge transport. In contrast, PM6's flexible backbone shortens its persistence length, driving amorphous tie‐chain formation at high Mn that disrupts crystallinity and exacerbates recombination. These results establish polymer conformation and persistence length as universal descriptors linking Mn to microstructure, resolving long‐standing contradictions in polymer design.",

Many respiratory viruses induce indistinguishable clinical symptoms, making accurate detection and effective surveillance challenging. Here, a polarization‐sensitive multiplex biochip is presented utilizing self‐assembled anisotropic nanochains for simultaneous colorimetric detection of multiple pathogens in human nasal, throat, and serum samples. The biochip features a patterned wettability surface, wherein the hydrophobic pattern facilitates precise sample segmentation, blocking the detection interferences. The hydrophilic areas can be utilized not only to print functionalized nanochains for selective identifications of different respiratory viruses, but also to support target preconcentration through the coffee‐ring phenomenon, enhancing the efficiency of virus detection. Furthermore, strong light confinement is shown near the nanochain surface by tailoring incident polarization, which enlarges colorimetric response sensitivity to virus loading. Thus, the simultaneous quantification of various respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and adenovirus, is achieved with a detection limit of 10 PFU mL−1. In clinical tests, influenza patients are successfully distinguished from other volunteers with an accuracy of 96.2%. This method eliminates the need for extrinsic labels or preamplification, which is expected to expand at‐home diagnostic tools for respiratory pathogens.",

Recent advancements have focused on either inference or training acceleration.

This work presents an all‐in‐one analog AI accelerator, combining these capabilities to enable energy‐efficient, continuously adaptable AI systems. The platform leverages an array of analog filamentary conductive‐metal‐oxide (CMO)/HfOx resistive switching memory cells (ReRAM) integrated into the back‐end‐of‐line (BEOL). The array demonstrates reliable resistive switching with voltage amplitudes below 1.5 V, compatible with advanced technology nodes. The array's multi‐bit capability (over 32 stable states) and low programming noise (down to 10 nS) enable a nearly ideal weight transfer process, more than an order of magnitude better than other memristive technologies. Inference performance is validated through matrix‐vector multiplication simulations on a 64 × 64 array, achieving a root‐mean‐square error improvement by a factor of 20 at 1 s and 3 at 10 years after programming, compared to state‐of‐the‐art. Training accuracy closely matching the software equivalent is achieved across different datasets.

However, the salt accumulation, intricate fabrication process, low evaporation rates, and condensate yields due to environmental stress limit its further practical applications. Herein, an ingenious polyelectrolyte strategy is proposed to effectively control salt accumulation and achieve higher condensate yields through remote and lightweight condensing structures. By sequentially adhering LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2‐δ (NCAL) and selectively modifying polystyrene sodium sulfonate (PSS) on a black polyvinyl alcohol sponge, a three‐dimensional (3D) porous foam structure is conveniently constructed (NCAL@PBS), which features a Donnan exclusion with efficient photothermal conversion and salt‐resistance with balanced water supply. The efficient evaporation rate of optimized NCAL@PBS exhibits 2.80 kg m−2 h−1 under one solar irradiation due to non‐radiative relaxation behavior achieved via oxygen vacancy defects (13%) in the NCAL structure, and low evaporation enthalpy (1621 J g−1), guaranteeing stable and efficient evaporation in complicated environments. The NCAL demonstrates nearly 100% antibacterial efficiency against S. aureus under one sun solar irradiation, attributed to photothermal‐induced hyperthermia that damages bacterial cell walls.

Herein, inspired by the natural secretion of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and colon colonization behavior of probiotics, a biomimetic probiotics platform (OSM) using bicontinuous single primitive metal–phenolic networks (SP‐MPNs) loaded with OMVs derived from E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is developed. Notably, the ordered mesopores, high specific surface area, and excellent antioxidant properties of SP‐MPNs demonstrate a high loading capacity (≈30%, w/w) and protective effects for OMVs. Impressively, OSM not only responds to transferrin (Tf) for the slow release of OMVs but also strongly interacts with mucin in the mucus layers, prolonging the retention time of OMVs in the colon (>48 h). Furthermore, OSM exhibits robust antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. Significantly, in comparison with the probiotic EcN, OSM demonstrates superior adhesion properties, higher OMVs release amount, and eliminates the risk of inducing bacteremia. To protect OSM from gastric acid degradation, OSM is encapsulated into ascorbyl palmitate (AP) to form OMVs@SP‐MPNs@AP (OSMA) hydrogel, which demonstrates preventive and therapeutic efficacy in colitis mouse models. In summary, the biomimetic platform provides a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.",

A dual‐carrier system of regenerated cationic cellulose (RCC) and Ga is first proposed to achieve steady‐state CuxS QDs with quantum confinement, sulfur‐rich vacancies, and p‐type Schottky structure, maximizing their photocatalytic activity. The Schottky junction interface and internal electric field accelerate carrier separation, while sulfur vacancies act as hot electron traps, further suppressing electron–hole recombination.

These reactive species high‐efficiently sterilize E. coli, S. aureus, and drag‐resistant bacteria, achieving logarithmic removal values of 6–8 at a high bacterial concentration (108 CFU mL−1) under visible‐light illumination.

    "abstract": "AbstractImaging the behavior and fate of implanted cells is crucial in cell therapy. However, it remains challenging to achieve synchronized tracing of different behaviors for the same cell due to the lack of a multimodal imaging probe. Herein, through flexible polypeptide linkers, S‐L‐D‐S and G‐S‐S‐G, a multifunctional probe is constructed by fusing three imaging proteins, including bioluminescent imaging reporter (NanoLuc), fluorescent protein (mRuby2), and calcium indicator (GCamp6f). A lentivirus carrying the triple‐fusion probe is prepared for stable transfection of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). During the long‐term differentiation of hiPSCs into neural lineage cells and human cerebral organoids (hCOs), the multifunctional probe could be used for bioluminescent imaging with ≈10‐cell sensitivity, single‐cell fluorescent imaging, and functional imaging of calcium activity. Then, hiPSC‐derived neural progenitors and hCOs are transplanted into the mouse brains. Multimodal imaging is performed to trace the survival, distribution, integration, and functional activity of transplanted cells, providing multi‐scale data of exogenous cell behavior and fate in host brains. These results demonstrate that the triple‐fusion probe could be a powerful tool for the comprehensive evaluation of cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGraphene oxide (GO) membranes are promising candidates to revolutionize nanofiltration, due to their atomic thickness and ultrafast water transport. Yet their practical use is hindered by structural damage under high pressure. Conventional strategies like thickening membranes, reducing interlayer spacing, or cross‐linking nanosheets improve pressure resistance but significantly reduce water permeability to impractical levels (e.g., 0.15 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 at 60 bar). Here, this dilemma is addressed by designing ultrathin GO/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid membranes. The CNT network reinforces the stacked GO nanosheets by reducing their free‐standing diameter while increasing membrane thickness and Young's modulus. The pressure resistance is achieved up to 60 bar, triple that of the pristine GO membranes. A maximum water flux of 966 ± 96 L m−2 h−1 is achieved by a 68 nm thick GO/CNT membrane with optimal GO nanosheet size and CNT loading amount, facilitating 1–3 orders of magnitude higher water flux per unit membrane thickness than all available membranes. This breakthrough resolves the critical trade‐offs among pressure resistance, flux, and membrane thickness, marking a transformative leap in GO‐based nanofiltration efficiency. The innovation holds immediate potential for applications in sustainable water remediation, pharmaceuticals, energy storage, and electronics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBone tumors are challenging to eradicate, with conventional limb‐salvage surgeries often leading to high rates of recurrence, metastasis, and severe functional impairments due to large bone defects. Traditional therapies struggle to balance tumor elimination with bone preservation and functional restoration. This study presents a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing high‐purity biodegradable magnesium (Mg) implants, which induce dual‐mode bone tumor death orchestrated by the cGAS‐STING pathway. Released Mg ions trigger autophagic cell death through TRPM7‐mediated uptake, with cGAS‐STING promoting LC3 lipidation by supplying STING‐laden ERGIC membranes. Simultaneously, alkaline degradation byproducts disrupt tumor metabolism by suppressing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, with cGAS‐STING further targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2) to amplify metabolic collapse. This coordinated mechanism reshapes the tumor microenvironment, promoting M1 macrophage polarization, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and enhanced intratumoral IFN‐γ secretion, fostering a robust, sustained immune response. The therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of Mg implants are validated in murine osteosarcoma, patient‐derived xenografts, and VX2 rabbit bone tumor models, demonstrating significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival without systemic toxicity. This work highlights the multifunctional capabilities of biodegradable Mg implants, integrating autophagic death, metabolic suppression, and immune modulation through cGAS‐STING coordination, presenting a promising and clinically translatable strategy for advanced bone tumor therapy.",

Here, the Fe3O4‐FeCo‐Fe5C2 ternary catalyst was successfully constructed. Notably, the different contents of Co doping optimized the heterogeneous catalytic interface of the FeCo alloy clusters, which promoted the targeted conversion of CO2 to light olefins in high yield (22.4%) and effectively suppressed the generation of CO (4.4%). The study shows that the formation of FeCo alloy clusters significantly promotes the forward progression of the Reverse Water‐Gas Reaction (RWGS), which can greatly enhance the conversion of CO2 and inhibit the formation of CO according to Le Chatelier's principle. Moreover, the FeCo alloy clusters significantly promoted the rapid formation of CHx and induced the chain growth of CHx on Fe5C2 phase. Hence, the clever construction of FeCo alloy clusters significantly strengthens the kinetic coupling between the RWGS and FTS reactions. Additionally, the in‐situ structural evolution of the catalysts, along with the real‐time formation process of the products, was monitored through in‐situ characterization. This work is promising to provide an effective strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to achieve high yields of light olefins over FeCo alloy clusters.",

Herein N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) functionalization of WS2 is demonstrated via a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) route, which exploits both the electronic and steric effect for TMD functionalization. The Lewis base, 1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)imidazol‐2‐ylidene (IMes), is anchored to the sulfur vacancy sites (Lewis acid) of the WS2 nanostructures with the hybrid‐interface‐mediated steric hinderance, mimicking the FLP chemistry and enabling dihydrogen cleavage at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) results reveal the local chemical environment of the activated hydrogen species, which can be transferred for room‐temperature hydrogenation reactions. The insights are useful for designing weak, non‐covalent bonds to modify the 2D surface of TMDs for a broad scope of applications.",

The perfectly matched thermal expansion coefficient minimizes the interfacial stress between EP and chips or thermoelectric cooler, thus a simple thermoelectric cooling architecture is designed for power semiconductor device without thermal interface material 2 (TIM2), which enables to achieve a cooling temperature of 26.85 °C, 8 °C lower than that with TIM2 (18.89 °C).",

The w‐MnSe exhibits an altermagnet semiconducting nature characterized by a direct bandgap of 1.98 eV and spin splitting of up to 245 meV in the valence band structure. The w‐MnSe has an in‐plane magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of −31 µeV per cell along the a‐direction and a Néel temperature (TN) of ≈405 K. Besides, the w‐MnSe exhibits a giant out‐of‐plane spontaneous electric polarization of 53 µC cm−2 and a moderate energy barrier of 0.37 eV f.u−1. The ferroelectric critical temperature (TC) of 965 K is obtained, and this may indicate excellent thermal stability. The correlation is postulated between altermagnetim and ferroelectricity to control spin orientation mediated by the rotation of polyhedra formed by nonmagnetic elements within the lattice structure.

These findings reveal that high glucose microenvironments generate excessive reactive oxygen species in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic impairment. These pathophysiological disruptions suppress osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs while driving pro‐inflammatory polarization in BMDMs, processes closely tied to high‐glucose‐induced inhibition of Adenosine 5′‐monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Restoration of AMPK phosphorylation emerges as a pivotal strategy to mitigate oxidative stress and restore cellular function. To address this, a dual‐targeted therapeutic system (DLNPs@HA hydrogel) is developed that combines anti‐CD105‐antibody‐modified nanoliposomes and phosphatidylserine‐modified nanoliposomes, both encapsulating the specific AMPK activator α‐lipoic acid. This hydrogel facilitates sustained nanoparticle release, enabling precise and effective delivery to BMSCs and BMDMs. In vitro, DLNPs@HA hydrogel successfully enhances osteogenic activity and suppresses inflammatory responses. In vivo, it accelerates fracture healing in diabetic mice. By precisely targeting BMSCs and BMDMs and reversing bicellular oxidative stress, this integrative medical‐engineering strategy provides a promising and translatable solution for diabetic fracture repair, seamlessly bridging mechanistic insights with therapeutic innovation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe controllable two‐step deposition of perovskite films is advantageous for large‐area manufacturing. However, the incomplete reaction between the initially deposited lead iodide (PbI2) layer and subsequent organic ammonium salts remains a significant challenge, which ultimately degrades the perovskite film quality. Differing from the conventional PbI2 porosity regulation or PbI2‐based intermediate phase engineering, this study innovatively introduces N‐methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and isopropylamine hydrochloride (IPACl) in the organic salt solution to synergistically modulate the crystal growth of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films. The research findings suggest that the coordinative solvent, NMP, can partially dissolve the initially deposited compact PbI2 layer while simultaneously in situ forming the PbI2‐NMP adducts, thereby promoting the formation of α‐phase perovskite. Further integration of IPACl plays a role in the van der Waals interaction, enhancing the oriented growth of α‐phase perovskite and suppressing the δ‐phase formation during thermal annealing. Consequently, highly crystalline FAPbI3 films featuring enlarged grain size, more uniform morphology, smoother surface, and lower defect density are demonstrated, rendering a champion efficiency of 25.50% for two‐step processed perovskite solar cells, along with significantly improved stability. Moreover, the doctor‐blade coated solar mini‐modules demonstrate champion efficiencies of 20.30% and 16.06% with aperture areas of 16 and 100 cm2, respectively.",

As the search for new materials has expanded beyond the traditional nuclear field, it is important to recall best practices on how to characterize the energy resolution of a detector so that it can be properly compared with previously reported data in the literature and more effectively advance the field forward. Here, as part of this special edition, the path toward reporting comparable energy resolution is presented through the case study of BiI3. Notwithstanding the essential optimization of single crystal growth, and detector manufacturing processes, as well as the fine‐tuning of detector electronics required for taking a promising material into a deployable detector, the evolution that took BiI3 single crystals detectors from barely able to collect a 241Am alpha spectrum to a first‐ever 241Am gamma spectrum, and eventually to demonstrate a 137Cs 662 keV gamma spectrum with 2.2% energy resolution is reviewed as a case study of RTSD research and development.",

To address this limitation, a novel approach inspired by 2D cellular solids is introduced, utilizing discrete conformal mapping of perforated 2D cellular layouts onto TPMS surfaces to minimize distortion during 3D mapping. This study focuses on primitive (P)‐type Conformally Perforated Shellular Metamaterials (CPSMs), evaluating their thermomechanical and acoustic properties through computational analyses and experimentation on 3D‐printed samples. Effective thermomechanical properties are determined via asymptotic homogenization, which demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of CPSMs can be calculated by multiplying the effective thermal conductivities of the 3D shellular and 2D thermally‐isotropic cellular architectures. Thermal conductivity and elastic stiffness are systematically enhanced by engineering the shell's in‐plane architecture while preserving the 3D topology. The optimized design demonstrates a significant increase in elastic stiffness compared to an intact P‐shellular of the same density. Numerical and experimental results reveal that the 2D‐mapped architecture effectively tunes the acoustic bandwidth and bandgap frequency range of CPSMs, achieving a 79% increase in bandwidth and a 34% reduction in material density compared to an intact P‐shellular. These findings highlight CPSMs' potential for structural, thermal, and acoustic applications, advancing the development of additively manufactured TPMS‐based multifunctional metamaterials.",

Herein, a promising anode material of KCu7S4 nanowires with a tunnel structure is proposed for SIBs. The Na+ (de)insertion mechanisms of the KCu7S4 anode are comprehensively elucidated through a combination of in situ TEM/SAED/XRD analyses and theoretical calculations. The detailed intermediates (Na3Cu4S4, NaCuS) and final products (CuS, Cu) during (de)sodiation processes are identified, revealing that the highly mobile Cu+ ion can facilitate the formation of tunnel‐structured Na3Cu4S4 and layer‐structured NaCuS during the electrochemical reaction process. The reaction dynamics indicate that the formation of Na3Cu4S4 and NaCuS intermediates facilitates electron transfer and ion diffusion during Na+ (de)insertion. Moreover, the KCu7S4 anode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 337 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1, and the corresponding Na3V2(PO4)3//KCu7S4 full cell delivers a high energy density of 303 Wh kg−1 at 375 W kg−1, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.

    "abstract": "AbstractFor gas‐forming electrochemical reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the unavoidable adhesion of the produced gas bubbles to the electrode often compromises the access of the electrolyte to the catalytically active sites and the subsequent electron transfer processes, overall perturbing the performance of the electrochemical reaction. To address this important challenge, a few extremely bubble repellent coatings have been introduced in the recent past — but at expense of diminished electrochemically active surface areas and reaction kinetics. Here, a metal‐free, robust coating on nickel foam (NF) following electro deposition of a single component, i.e., polyglycerol‐modified pyrrole, without incurring any wastage is introduced. The polyglycerol moiety ensures extreme gas‐bubble repellence due to low bubble adhesion forces, permitting the early detachment of produced hydrogen gas bubbles. On the other side, the conjugated polypyrrole chain facilitates the electron transfer process within and through the coating. These synergistic attributes enable HER with a reduced overpotential (28% at 100 mA cm−2), a smaller Tafel slope (84.2 vs 100.8 mV dec−1), and an increased electrochemically active surface area by 104% as compared to the underlying bare NF electrode.",

    "abstract": "Abstract2D Ruddlesden‐Popper (2DRP) perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next‐generation photovoltaic devices owing to their excellent environmental stability, moisture resistance, and photo‐stability. However, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still lag behind those of their 3D counterparts, primarily due to the poor charge‐carrier transport associated with the insulating bulky organic spacer cations. In this work, a series of halogenated chiral organic spacers–S‐α‐fluorophenylethylamine acrylate (S‐α‐FPEAAA), S‐α‐chlorophenylethylamine acrylate (S‐α‐ClPEAAA), and S‐α‐bromophenylethylamine acrylate (S‐α‐BrPEAAA)–are employed to regulate charge transport within the 2DRP framework. Incorporating halogen atoms facilitates halogen–halogen interactions between the organic spacers and the PbI64− octahedral framework, thereby enhancing structural ordering and electronic coupling. Among these, the S‐α‐BrPEAAA‐based perovskites exhibit superior film morphology, improved crystallinity, and an exceptional carrier lifetime of 3.353 µs. Notably, an inverted perovskite solar cell based on S‐α‐BrPEAAA achieves a high PCE of 20.30%, rivaling the best‐performing systems reported recently. Moreover, the device demonstrates excellent long‐term stability, retaining over 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of storage under nitrogen atmosphere. These findings highlight the potential of halogenated chiral organic spacers in advancing high‐performance and stable 2D perovskite photovoltaics.",

Hence, a systematic investigation of the chemical composition and electronic properties of TiO2 film grown via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on p‐doped, atomically well‐ordered, phosphorus‐terminated InP(100) surfaces is conducted. A combination of UV and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is applied to provide a comprehensive atomic‐scale understanding of the heterointerface. These results reveal that the P−P dimers in the first monolayer remain intact during the initial ALD cycles, while oxygen preferentially binds between indium in the second monolayer and phosphorus in the first monolayer, leading to the formation of interfacial indium phosphate (InPOx) species. The presence of chlorine residues from the TiCl4 precursor persists throughout the deposition process and influences the chemical environment of the interface. Band alignment analysis confirms the formation of a type‐II heterojunction, characterized by a valence band offset of approximately 2.3 eV and a conduction band offset of 0.45 eV, facilitating charge carrier separation essential for high‐efficiency photoelectrochemical applications. These detailed insights into the interfacial chemistry and electronic structure are fundamental to advance the development of efficient semiconductor‐based energy conversion devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA dual‐function photoelectrochemical (PEC) separation system is demonstrated for rare‐earth element (REE) recovery. The sustainable release of the captured REEs is promoted through the synergistic integration of a redox‐reaction for electrostatic repulsion, and in situ proton generation for ion‐exchange, all driven by photoelectrochemistry. The platform consists of a redox‐copolymer, poly(ferrocenylpropyl methacrylamide‐co‐methacrylic acid) (P(FPMAm‐co‐MAA)) (PFM), conjugated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and coated onto titanium dioxide nanorods (TNRs). The (PFM‐CNT)/TNR spontaneously adsorbs up to 214.2 mg of Yttrium/g PFM by ion‐exchange, and demonstrates broad applicability for other REEs. The adsorbed REEs are released through the PEC oxidation of ferrocene (Fc) to ferrocenium (Fc+), and the simultaneous PEC water splitting reactions at the TNRs that protonate the carboxylate binding groups. This dual photoelectrochemically‐driven mechanism for REE release is investigated by in situ pH measurements, as well as vibrational and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Through PEC approaches, a 68.8% reduction in energy consumption during REE recovery has been achieved compared to purely electrochemical systems, with a regeneration efficiency close to 100%. For NdFeB magnets from waste hard disk drives, Nd and Dy recovery efficiencies of 59.2 and 61.1% are achieved. The dual‐functionality of these copolymer PEC systems offers a sustainable platform for modulating critical element recovery.",

Here, this work reports a selenium‐mediated strategy to construct sub‐nanometers amorphous shell on ultrafine Pt nanocrystal core, forming a Pt@PtSex core/shell nanostructure. In this developed strategy, the active Se‐oleylamine precursor after Pt nucleation confines the overgrowth and oriented attachment of Pt, allowing the in situ formation of core/shell nanostructures combining ultrafine size and sub‐nano amorphous shell. Essentially, the sub‐nano amorphous PtSex shell can not only optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy and lower the water dissociation energy, but also retard the dissolution of Pt atoms, thus leading to significantly improved activity and durability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The overall water splitting can be driven by a small cell voltage of 1.48/1.53 V at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4/1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, Pt@PtSex‐1 with ≈0.8 nm thick amorphous shell exhibits ultra‐high mass activity of 75.2 A mgPt−1 in acidic and 18.4 A mgPt−1 in alkaline at −70 mV, as well as a robust durability with stable operation for 1100 h at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline (1300 h at 160 mA cm−2 in acidic), superior to the most reported Pt‐based electrocatalysts.",

This work presents a one‐pot two‐step linear sequence for the efficient deracemization of β‐chlorohydrins by combining a photocatalytic alcohol oxidation with a stereoselective carbonyl bioreduction using alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Despite the thermodynamic challenges of the oxidation step for this family of substrates, three efficient photochemical conditions under white light irradiation were found using catalytic 2,4,6‐triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPPT) or 2,3‐dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ) in this case in stoichiometric or by in situ regeneration of the catalyst. In addition, its sunlight‐driven applicability and its implementation in flow chemistry were demonstrated. After testing the scope of these methodologies, 2‐chloro‐1‐arylethanols were found as suitable substrates. For those β‐halohydrins oxidized with complete conversion, the deracemization strategy was successfully achieved yielding twelve enantiopure (R)‐ and (S)‐β‐halohydrins. Furthermore, 2‐chloro‐1‐phenylethanol enantiomers were subjected to an additional chemical cyclization under basic conditions, providing both (R)‐ and (S)‐styrene oxide in a three‐step one‐pot process and without loss of the optical activity.",

However, conventional synthesis routes are limited in scale. Therefore, a novel spray‐drying method is presented herein, enabling a scalable synthesis of LMO sorbents for Li extraction. The ion‐exchange material is studied in both synthetic LiCl solutions and two different geothermal brines from the Upper Rhine Valley, demonstrating improved Li selectivity and extraction capabilities compared to materials from hydrothermal synthesis approaches. The extraction behavior in relevant mildly acidic environments is studied in detail. Further material improvements are achieved by substituting a fraction of Mn by Ti, which greatly reduced the dissolution of manganese during acid treatment in the first 5 extraction cycles from 5.6% to only 1.8%. In addition, the maximum sorption capacity of the Ti‐substituted LMO (LMTO) can be further increased from 5.05 mmol g for LMO (35.1 mg g) to 5.66 mmol g for LMTO (39.3 mg g) under optimized m/V ratios. Hence, the results reported herein present a pathway toward LMO‐based ion‐exchange materials for the direct lithium extraction on an industrial scale.",

Sustainable and environment‐friendly surfactants offer a promising solution for mitigating these impacts. This study introduces an emulsifier composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and partially cation‐substituted hyaluronate (CHA), both of which are derived from abundant and cost‐effective natural polysaccharides. The synergistic interplay of electrostatic interactions and controlled molecular entanglement between these macromolecules significantly enhances the stability and ripening resistance of the water‐in‐oil emulsion. This optimized formulation demonstrates remarkable longevity, maintaining emulsion integrity for over 365 days while exhibiting exceptional salt tolerance and pH stability across various environmental conditions. Additionally, this entangled polysaccharide‐based Pickering emulsion demonstrated strong adhesion to leaf surfaces, resisting the effects of strong winds and the water‐repellent properties of the lotus leaves. These characteristics associated with microbial compatibility suggest that emulsifiers based on CNCs and CHA provide safer and more sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants, especially pertinent to the agrochemical sector.",

Here, we reveal that [HSO4−] and water can collaboratively promote the rate‐limiting step of the CH bond breaking on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 catalyst. An in‐depth study suggests that water mediates hole transfer to the CH bond while [HSO4−] facilitates electron extraction, thus promoting electron and proton transfer on the Ru‐ZnIn2S4 surface. Consequently, photocatalytic DMF coupling over Ru‐ZnIn2S4 produces diesel fuel precursors (DFPs) and H2 with benchmarking formation rates of 1.5 g gcatal.−1 h−1 and 9.7 mmol gcatal.−1 h−1, respectively. Moreover, the selectivity of branched‐chain DFPs reaches 55%. This work puts forward new insight and strategy for photocatalytic CC coupling for the synthesis of biofuels.",

Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is one of these technologies in which catalysts play an essential role. In this work, the impact of impurities in catalysts on the output of RCF is investigated. It is found that the yield of phenolic monomers is almost not influenced by the residual chloride (Cl) ions in the commercially available Ru/C catalyst. However, the presence of Cl ions in the catalyst facilitated hemicellulose removal and delignification. Moreover, the enzymatic conversion rate of cellulose in the solid residue increases after RCF, attributed to the enhanced removal of lignin and hemicellulose in the presence of Cl ions. The impact of Cl ions can be eliminated by removing the Cl ions in the catalyst. This work provides an engineering perspective for upscaling RCF technology using large‐scale synthesized catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Developing a selective lignin depolymerization process remains a daunting challenge due to lignin's inherent structural heterogeneity and chemical complexity. This study used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction to produce oligomeric lignin with controlled structural characteristics (narrow size distribution, lower molecular weight) and further subjected it to oxidative depolymerization using peracetic acid as an oxidant. Oxidation of lignin resulting from lactic acid/pyrazole and choline chloride/lactic acid extraction produces phenolic acids (Ph‐COOH) and dicarboxylic acid (DCA) as significant products. Our results show that the judicial choice of DES during extraction plays a critical role in determining the lignin chemical structure, which follows different oxidation pathways and results in different product selectivities. The generalization of this concept has been established with two different parent lignins, e.g., Douglas fir (D.fir) and wheat straw (WS). The overall process showed that the novel DES extraction not only provides a sustainable pathway for high‐purity lignin generation but also could be used as a tool to produce high‐value products selectively upon its oxidation, thus improving the overall lignin biorefinery process.",

However, both monomer and polymer syntheses typically require anaerobic and moisture‐free conditions, often employing hazardous reagents and solvents that limit scalability. Herein, efficient, scalable syntheses for poly(ethyl lipoate) and ethyl lipoate that incorporate Green Chemistry principles are disclosed. The synthesis of ethyl lipoate from lipoic acid on a 100‐gram scale (>80% yield) is optimized lowering the E‐factor (2.27) by an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Diphenyl phosphate, a nonhazardous commercial organic acid, is used to synthesize ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethyl lipoate) on a 50‐gram scale from cationic ROP (CROP). The polymerizations proceed under ambient atmosphere in low‐hazard and renewable solvents, and a mild depolymerization strategy to regenerate the monomer is developed. Due to their extreme molar mass, the materials possess unique mechanical and physical properties. Life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted on synthetic and recycling processes shows that the polydisulfide has competitive environmental impacts comparable to several commodity polymers, despite the latter having an efficiency advantage due to economies of scale. These discoveries establish an economical and scalable closed‐loop polymer platform that can be broadly applied to various polydisulfides sourced from 1,2‐dithiolanes such as lipoic acid.",

Even though in air atmosphere, its HPR value still reaches 6339 μmol h‐1 g‐1 with good recyclability. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to the the enhanced polarity through the incoporation of strong polar sulfone or cyano groups in the COF frameworks, which brings about the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, high photocurrent intensity and low charge resistance as well as the increased surface hydrophilicity. The photocatalytic mechanism is studied by means of the theoretical calculations and comparative experiments conducted under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of the various scavengers for electron, hole, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical in the reaction system.",

Research studies are most generally carried out with pure gas streams of CO2, while the available real sources of CO2 are gases coming out from industrial plants and containing a low share of CO2, and a great diversity of impurities including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Here, we show that a molecular catalyst, [Rh(bpy)(Cp*)Cl]Cl (bpy = bipyridine, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), catalyzes CO2RR to formic acid using a quasi flue gas (5‐10% CO2 and 100 ppm NO2 or 50 ppm SO2) with substantial selectivity. This is made possible thanks to the modification of the cathode surface with a positively charged imidazolium layer, which greatly favors CO2RR over competing reactions, proton, NO2 and SO2 reductions. These results highlight the potential of combining molecular catalysis and electrode surface modification for electroreduction of diluted CO2 without prior carbon capture or purification.",

However, their synthesis often requires complicated reaction conditions limiting their scalability. In this study, we present a straightforward and scalable synthesis method for a BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C oxy‐electride composite via carboxylic acid complexation (pseudo‐Pechini) followed by carbothermal reduction. The resulting composite exhibits significant surface area, of ~41 m2 g‐1, which is considerably higher than the electrides prepared by solid‐state synthesis. Upon loading with ruthenium, the BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C composite demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis, achieving rates of 3090 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 0.6Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C, and 3737 μmol g‐1catalyst h‐1 with 1.1Ru/BaAl2O4‐ye‐y/C at mild reaction conditions (400 °C and 1 bar). Comprehensive characterization through XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and STEM‐EDS confirmed the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, while iodometric titration method and EPR analysis confirmed the electride‐like nature of the resulting composite.

Liquid catalytic fuel cells (LCFCs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to utilize complex biomass fuels directly. However, conventional LCFCs face challenges related to the cross‐membrane permeation of catalysts, which leads to electrolyte imbalance and cell failure. To address the issue, this study proposed a novel LCFC system using the same catalyst, molybdovanadophosphoric heteropolyacid (PMoV), on both the anode and cathode, effectively mitigating catalyst permeation. Under ambient conditions, the PMoV‐LCFC system achieved a maximum power density of 3.39 mW cm−2 using glucose as the fuel, and the system demonstrated stable performance over five days. Notably, cyclic discharge tests using expired bread as fuel further show the system's effectiveness. The total organic carbon degradation rate reached a maximum of 23.36%, and formic acid was the primary intermediate. The PMoV‐LCFC system effectively reduced catalyst crossover and maintained stable electrochemical performance, offering new insights for designing biomass fuel cells and significantly contributing to waste management.",

In this work, we have demonstrated a hydrophobic tetrapodal receptor Se4Me‐PF6, that exhibits iodine adsorption from an aqueous phase via chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction. In the solution phase, NMR studies reveal that Se4Me‐PF6 selectively recognizes iodide (I−) over other anions. On the other hand, in the solid state, selenoimidazolium building units of Se4Me‐PF6 facilitate self‐assembly into a porous 1D supramolecular ChB framework, enabling efficient iodine adsorption. Consequently, Se4Me‐PF6 has propelled the rapid adsorption of iodine, with a high kinetic rate of 2.10 × 10−3 g·mg−1·min−1, while maintaining its effectiveness under competitive environmental conditions, including pH variations and the presence of interfering anions. Mechanistic investigations using XPS, and DFT studies indicate that iodine capture occurs via a combination of ChB interactions and electrostatic forces provided by the selenoimidazolium motifs. Importantly, Se4Me‐PF6 demonstrates its potential as a stationary phase for column‐based iodine removal, highlighting its applicability in real‐world scenarios. Thus, these findings offer a promising approach for developing iodine adsorbent materials.",

Alkali metals, budget friendly and commonly used as additives to optimize the performance of Pt‐based alloy catalysts, are extensively utilized in the PDH industry. Herein, the structure and catalytic performance of the commercial catalyst (PtK2/θ‐Al2O3) and contrast samples (Pt0.3K0.8/θ‐Al2O3‐N and Pt0.3/θ‐Al2O3) are analyzed. According to the catalytic test, the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 exhibits better catalytic performance, which achieves >95% propylene selectivity and maintaining a high propane yield (>36%) during stability testing. Observations reveal that the initial propylene selectivity of the Pt‐based catalysts is inversely correlated with the total acidity and strong acid site content. The introducing of K element significantly reduces the acidity of the catalyst and enhances the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the presence of Cl−, co‐introduced with K, improves the catalytic stability, while the slight increase in the acidity of catalysts decreases the propylene selectivity. The enrichment of the electron density of PtK2 nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggest that lower propylene adsorption energy and higher barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation reaction on the PtK2‐(100) surface enhance the propylene selectivity of the PtK2/θ‐Al2O3 catalyst.",

Nevertheless, the leakage risk and inferior electrode compatibility impede their further application toward high‐performance SMBs. Herein, a novel DEE based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSi) and ethyl‐2‐cyano‐3‐ethoxyacrylate (ECE) is developed through their Lewis acid–base interaction and the further ECE‐based deep eutectic gel electrolyte (GE) is constructed with cross‐linked ploy(vinylene carbonate) (PVC) as matrix network. It is demonstrated that incorporating electron‐withdrawing PVC polymer into the ECE‐based DEE changes the coordination environment of Na+ ions, thus facilitating the Na‐ions desolvation and transport and leading to a high transference number of Na‐ions (0.7). Moreover, the strong interaction between PVC chains and Na‐ions can induce the preferential reduction of PVC to form O‐rich inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thus promoting the electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability with superior long‐term cycling stability. Benefiting from the stable SEI layer, the Na3V2(PO4)3//Na cell with GE displays outstanding cycling (capacity retention of 94.5% after 300 cycles at 1C) and rate (high capacity of 75.5 mAh g−1 at 2 °C) performance than that of ECE‐based DEE cell, showcasing the promising application of advanced deep eutectic GE in high performance SMBs.",

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy experiments show that the charge‐transfer resistance (RCT) follows the same trend as EGOPd activity, with the 3:1 Pd:Ag electrode having the lowest RCT. Electrolysis with this electrode at 0.705 V vs. RHE, where Pd is reduced, results in glycolate production with no overoxidation to formate or oxalate.

In this study, a fluorine‐doped single‐particle LiNiO2 was prepared via a hydrothermal synthesis assisted by ball milling, resulting in a stable charge/discharge process at a current density of 0.2C, with a capacity retention of 90% after 60 cycles and first discharge capacity of 220 mAh.g‐1. The incorporation of fluorine was confirmed through cross‐sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which revealed a correlation between fluorine doping and the partial reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+. The impact of fluorine doping on the structural stability of LiNiO2 was investigated using in‐situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the F doping strategy demonstrated the dual benefit of high capacity and cycle retention in single‐particle LiNiO2 cathodes.",

    "abstract": "We present here a scheme for production of singlet oxygen in aqueous medium by pyrochlore based nanocomposite of p‐type bismuth stannate (Bi2Sn2O7) and carbon dots (Bi2Sn2O7/CD), and demonstrate its applications as photocatalysts for tetracycline degradation, and as electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction via water splitting. The batches of Bi2Sn2O7/CD are synthesized by hydrothermal method with varying carbon dot contents and they are thoroughly characterized to obtain their structural, morphological, textural and compositional information. The carbon dots in the nanocomposite offered photosensitizing behaviour. About 96% photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride is achieved in 40 min (k = 0.072 min‐1), which is 3.6 times higher than pristine Bi2Sn2O7. The rate of singlet oxygen production in the reaction medium has been studied with respect to sunlight exposure time by EPR, which is described as a key for enhanced photocatalytic degradation. In addition, the batch of Bi2Sn2O7/(CD)3.0 as an electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is revealed from low overpotential 136 mV at 10 mA cm‐2 and Tafel slope of 41 mV dec‐1 in 1M KOH, corresponding to high mass activity of 22.2 A g‐1 and high specific activity 0.018 mA cm‐2 at η=350 mV. The mechanism of alkaline HER is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cathode active material is the most valuable component of spent lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), accounting for approximately 30% of their overall value. Direct recycling of cathode materials involves recovering, regenerating, and reusing them without breaking down their chemical structure. This approach maximizes the added value of the cathode compound and reduces manufacturing costs by avoiding the need for virgin material production. However, one key challenge in scaling direct recycling from lab to industry is the requirement for highly purified cathode materials, contrasting with the low purity of black mass generated from battery shredding. No efficient separation process currently exists to isolate different lithium‐nickel‐manganese‐cobalt oxides (NMCs) from each other. Thus, direct recycling technologies that can operate with mixtures of multiple NMC stoichiometries will be best‐suited for industrial adoption. This study explores the direct recycling of NMC mixtures into NMC 622 using a \"reciprocal ternary molten salts (RTMS)\" system. Ionothermal relithiation and upcycling within the RTMS system successfully restore the layered structure, lithium content, and electrochemical performance of degraded NMCs, yielding results comparable to pristine NMC 622 (P‐NMC 622).",

    "abstract": "The shift to renewable feedstocks is essential for developing “smart drop‐in” technologies to produce synthetic fuels and chemicals, playing a crucial role in industrial decarbonization. Herein, zeolite‐catalyzed glycerol valorization offers a mature way to create higher‐value chemicals. This study aims to identify the key factors influencing process efficiency by examining the reaction mechanisms of glycerol valorization using 10‐membered ring zeolites: ZSM‐5 (MFI, 3D), MCM‐22 (MWW, 2D), and ZSM‐22 (TON, 1D), each with unique topologies and channel structures. Strategic integration of catalytic studies with advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ UV‐vis and solid‐state NMR spectroscopy, reveals that zeolite topology plays a key role in determining catalytic performance and product selectivity. Zeolites with cages or intersectional voids (e.g., ZSM‐5, MCM‐22) promote the production of aromatic compounds, whereas the cage/void‐free ZSM‐22 favors acrolein formation. Simultaneously, zeolite channels balance the dual cycle mechanism by mediating between diffusion‐friendly straight channels (i.e., in ZSM‐5 and ZSM‐22) and diffusion‐restrictive sinusoidal channels (i.e., in ZSM‐5 and MCM‐22), affecting efficiency and selectivity. This study underscores the critical role of zeolite architecture in determining catalytic outcomes, providing mechanistic insights that bridge the structure‐performance gap.",

This alarming rise has intensified global efforts to mitigate climate change through carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies. Among these, the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals including formic acid and formate salts has emerged as a promising strategy. Formic acid is a versatile chemical and a potential hydrogen carrier, addressing challenges in hydrogen storage and transport. However, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid is thermodynamically challenging and to overcome these barriers, researchers have explored alternative pathways. Considering bicarbonate advantages, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of hydrogen‐driven bicarbonate conversion technologies, focusing on key catalytic routes: photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis and enzymatic catalysis. Each method leverages distinct energy inputs‐ heat, light, electricity and enzymes, to drive the conversion of bicarbonate, with varying efficiencies. Despite significant progress, challenges such as low production rates, catalyst stability and scalability remain. This review highlights recent advancements, key challenges and outlines future directions.",

In 2022, flooding slash caused devastating damage when Cyclone Gabrielle directly impacted the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. This study addresses the dual challenges of waste management and sustainable materials development by converting forestry slash into high‐performance carbon electrodes through an innovative in situ sulfur doping process. Building upon prior research involving waste‐derived materials, this study develops a hydrothermal sulfurization technique that transforms New Zealand slash into sulfur‐doped, highly graphitized carbon materials with excellent energy storage properties. The hydrothermally sulfurized slash‐derived electrode material (C‐HS‐New Zealand Slash (NZS)) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 148 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. A supercapacitor device assembles with the C‐HS‐NZS electrode achieves a capacitance of 440 F g−1 at the same current density. The energy density reaches 15.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. Furthermore, the C‐HS‐NZS‐based device delivers a maximum capacitance of 384 F g−1 and retains 360 F g−1 after 10,000 cycles, demonstrating excellent capacity retention and long‐term electrochemical stability.",

Developing biobased thermosets with efficient chemical recycling capabilities is therefore crucial for advancing a circular plastic economy and reducing environmental impact. Herein, this study reports the synthesis of recyclable acetal thermosets via the polycondensation of a biobased vanillin‐derived aldehyde and diols, utilizing oxalic acid as a catalyst, which can be easily removed during thermal postcuring. The resulting thermosets exhibit excellent mechanical performance, with tensile strengths up to 95 MPa, Young's moduli of ≈3.3 GPa, and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of ≈70 °C. More importantly, the thermosets are efficiently depolymerized under mild acidic conditions into their original monomers, which are easily isolated in high purity, with yields of 72% and 98% for the diol and aldehyde, respectively. These monomers were subsequently reused to synthesize new, identical thermosets, achieving closed‐loop recycling. This research addresses the environmental challenges posed by traditional thermosets, offering a practical solution for sustainable polymer recycling without compromising material performance. The solvent‐free approach further enhances its industrial viability, making a promising step toward a more sustainable strategy for closed‐loop recyclable thermosets.",

    "abstract": "The development of calcium‐ion batteries (CIBs) as potential successors to lithium‐ion batteries has been hindered by the lack of suitable electrolytes. Conventional electrolytes often decompose on the Ca anode, forming calcium‐ion impermeable passivation layers that impede reversible calcium plating and stripping. Therefore, the design of stable electrolytes or those capable of forming Ca2+ permeable passivation layers remains a critical challenge. The present study investigates calcium salts of  (Y = C/Si and X = –BO/OBO) anions using density functional theory (DFT)‐based simulations for CIBs. DFT calculations emphasize the oxidative stability of anions, while ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal their reductive behavior on the Ca anode. Time‐dependent charge transfer analysis and projected density of states provide an atomistic perspective on electron transfer between the Ca surface and anions, aligning with observations from frontier orbital analyses. Decomposition of  (Y = C/Si) anions during AIMD simulation reveals the formation of borate‐based species as part of the solid electrolyte interface, suggesting their potential as electrolytes that enable effective calcium plating and stripping. Overall, this work paves the way for designing efficient electrolytes, offering a fresh perspective to identify optimal CIB electrolytes, and moving beyond ensuring electrolyte stability on the Ca anode.",

    "abstract": "Acidic nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3‐RR) offers a promising route for sustainable nitrogen cycle. However, achieving high selectivity and efficiency under low‐concentration acidic conditions remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu nanosponge can adsorb low concentration nitric acid (HNO3) and efficiently convert it to ammonia (NH3). The Cu nanosponge is prepared by Cl‐‐induced reconstruction of porous Cu nanoparticles obtained through dealloying. In a Cl‐‐containing HNO3 solution, porous Cu nanoparticles undergo chemical oxidation to form CuCl, which reconstructs into a nanosponge through migration and electrochemical reduction, consisting of nanoparticle‐supported nanosheets. The nanosponge features abundant porous structures and numerous nanoparticle‐nanosheet interfaces, creating a large active surface area and providing adsorption and reaction sites for NO3‐. The optimized Cu nanosponge exhibits a 92% FE for NH3 at ‐0.4 V vs. RHE and 90% yield of NH3 in 0.03 M HNO3, significantly outperforming Cu nanoparticle (only 66% and 47%). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms that the nanosponge structure not only enhances NO3‐ adsorption but also stabilizes the key NO2‐ intermediate. Furthermore, we simulate industrial wastewater to convert low concentrations of nitrate into ammonium nitrate products, which are applied to plant cultivation, effectively promoting plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Organic aerogels, known for their lightweight, highly porous structure and ultralow thermal conductivity, have shown great potential in thermal insulation, chemical absorption, and energy storage. However, most aerogels to date pose environmental concerns, as their permanently cross‐linked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. Additionally, the use of toxic solvents in aerogel fabrication raises further environmental and health concerns, challenging their sustainable application. Moreover, the development of next‐generation organic aerogels requires the design of recyclable materials with improved mechanical properties. In response to these challenges, this study demonstrates the synthesis of chemically recyclable polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT) aerogels based on an amide containing aromatic diamine (BABS), utilizing N,N‐dimethyl lactamide (DML), a non‐toxic and label‐free solvent, as gelation medium. Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs) provide key insights into how solvent choice influences the morphology and properties of PHT aerogels. The resulting PHT aerogels exhibited low bulk density (≈ 63 mgcm−3), high porosity (≈ 96%), excellent thermal insulation properties (≈ 17 mWm−1K−1), and enhanced mechanical performance, all while being closed‐loop recyclable. This work highlights the importance of solvent selection in tuning aerogel properties and demonstrates a green route for fabricating sustainable, high‐performance thermal insulating materials.",

In this study, we intended to maintain the active sites and lower the synthesis costs by eliminating the need for heat treatment, leading to the polymerization of cobalt thioamide linkages for a more efficient and durable cobalt thioamide polymer synthesized through a polycondensation. This coordination polymer catalyst was supported on Ketjen Black and exhibited superior OER (Ej10=1.57V) and ORR (E1/2=0.71V) performances. The potential efficiency during long‐term durability of this polymer is examined by performing continuous OER operation for 260h and exhibiting only 5.1% performance decay. For ORR durability, only 39mV is required after 30,000 cycles in accelerated durability tests compared with the initial cycle. This study highlights the potential of cobalt‐coordinated polymer on Ketjen Black as high‐performing and durable alternatives to benchmark catalysts for OER and ORR.",

Conventional heating (CH) methods often require high‐temperature autoclave systems to achieve elevated temperatures and suppress vaporization of the reactant DMC (bp ≈ 90 °C). However, these systems usually entail extended reaction times and significant process cost. It is demonstrated that application of the MW‐assisted reflux technique to the aforementioned transesterification reaction intensifies the energy transfer rate to the reactor by leveraging on the polarity of the reactive mixture and enhances phase transition of the lowest boiling point by‐product (MeOH), thereby achieving 81% EC yield in half the time required under CH reflux conditions to reach only 52% EC yield. Further, compared to CH, MW heating enables 20‐fold lower catalyst loading for comparable EC yields, 9‐fold decrease in energy consumption per mole EC, and 92% reduction in energy consumption during the mixture preheating stage.",

The initial trapped charge population shows a slight decrease after Pt deposition, suggesting that the more reactive and mobile charges are extracted by Pt sites, leaving behind deeply trapped and long‐lived charges.

The results showed that doping with Fe improved the recovery performance of biochar and the N-doping enhanced the activity of PMS. Simultaneously, it achieved a high degradation efficiency for TC (93%) under optimized conditions within 30 min. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments indicated that the main active radicals present in the experiment were SO4•− and •OH. Additionally, FeN-BC demonstrated good catalytic performance in the TC degradation process in a real water environment after five cycles.

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes have attracted interest as an antimicrobial material for wound healing and implant-associated infections due to their bactericidal activity without the use of antibiotics. Hydrogels are frequently used as a delivery system; however, most research uses photonic activation in the form of near-infrared (NIR) laser stimulation to cause rapid BP degradation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and a localized photothermal effect. For implant-coating applications, using NIR laser stimulation could be challenging in practice, especially for porous orthopedic implants. This article investigates whether BP nanoflakes, suspended in Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogels, remain effective against Staphylococcus aureus without photonic activation. The experimental results showed 89.4 ± 7.6% bacterial inhibition from BP nanoflakes at a 5120 µg/mL concentration via passive diffusion in F127; however, it could not kill all the bacteria present. It is hypothesized that the F127 gel interface could create a barrier between the bacteria, which continue to multiply in media, and the antimicrobial black phosphorus compound, which degrades in the F127.",

    "abstract": "Metalloporphyrins, owing to their structural resemblance to natural enzyme active sites and highly tunable coordination environments, have emerged as promising catalysts for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to modify metalloporphyrins to improve their catalytic capability for CO2 reduction. One approach involves modifying the metal coordination environment (known as the first coordination sphere) to generate heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins, particularly N-confused and O/S-substituted variants. While heteroatom-containing metalloporphyrins were first synthesized in 1989, their use in CO2 reduction catalysis was not reported until after 2020. Herein, we review the recent progress in the design, catalytic performance, and mechanistic studies of N-confused and O/S-substituted metalloporphyrins towards CO2 reduction. This review encompasses both experimental and theoretical computational work, as well as the use of porphyrins as catalysts in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, based on the current research advances, we present critical recommendations and future research directions, with a focus on theoretical studies, in the hope of facilitating the rational design of novel catalysts for sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation.",

We previously reported a metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of selected Australian Terminalia spp. and highlighted numerous flavonoids that may contribute to the antimicrobial activities of those plants. This study examines the antibacterial activities of fifteen flavonoids found in Terminalia spp. against a range of gastrointestinal pathogens using broth dilution assays. Flavonoids were also combined with six different classes of conventional antibiotics to investigate interactions. The efflux pump inhibitory activity of the flavonoid was evaluated using ethidium bromide accumulation and efflux assays. Toxicities were assessed via human dermal fibroblast cell line assays. Fisetin, hispidulin, isoorientin, orientin, rutin, and vitexin showed noteworthy growth inhibitory activity (MIC values 62.5–250 µg/mL). Isoorientin and orientin were most potent against Bacillus cereus and Alcaligenes faecalis, displaying MIC values of 62.5 µg/mL against both bacteria. All flavonoids except genistein, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, taxifolin, and vitexin were nontoxic in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell proliferation assays. When individual flavonoids were combined with selected antibiotics, some potentiated the activity of these antibiotics. Two synergistic, eighteen additive and thirty-one non-interactive interactions were observed. The synergistic interactions were all observed in combination with orientin. Notably, orientin exhibited efflux pump inhibitory effects at concentrations from 15.26 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL. The findings reported herein indicate that the selected flavonoids have the potential for addressing bacterial antibiotic resistance and highlight the need for further study.",

This study aimed to characterize the phenolic profile of Corallodiscus flabellatus (or C. flabellata) and elucidate its mechanistic interactions with tyrosinase under high-altitude environments with intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Two novel phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and seven known compounds were isolated using silica gel, ODS, and preparative HPLC, with structures determined via NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and acid hydrolysis. Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) inhibition assays revealed divergent effects: compound 7 (containing a caffeoyl moiety) exhibited potent inhibition (IC50 = 0.23 μM), comparable to arbutin, while other PhGs displayed activation or biphasic responses. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compound 7 stabilized tyrosinase via π-π stacking with Phe264 and Cu²⁺ coordination, whereas activating compounds likely acted as substrates. These findings elucidate the dual regulatory function of PhGs, which activate tyrosinase to counteract acute ultraviolet-induced stress and inhibit its activity to attenuate oxidative overload, thereby advancing our understanding of alpine plant adaptation mechanisms.",

Separation was achieved using silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel, and structural elucidation was performed through advanced 1D and 2D NMR techniques, including HSQC, HMBC, and (IN)ADEQUATE. Due to kahweol’s instability, the research prioritized cafestol for the synthesis of rhodamine B conjugates. Initial ester-linked conjugates proved unstable, prompting the development of more robust derivatives through amide linkage strategies and further functionalization via acetylation and oxidation reactions. Some oxidation methods led to furan ring cleavage, impacting structural integrity. Selected compounds were tested for cytotoxicity using SRB assays on human tumor cell lines (MCF7, A2780) and non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). While the parent diterpenes and many derivatives showed minimal activity, several cafestol–rhodamine B conjugates demonstrated notable cytotoxic effects. Compound 6, in particular, exhibited selective activity against cancer cells with reduced toxicity toward non-malignant cells.",

Magnetic studies demonstrate that these complexes exhibit field-induced slow magnetic relaxation behaviors, with positive D values of 25.3(2), 21.6(1), and 19.4(2) cm−1 for 1Cl, 2Br, and 3I, respectively. Detailed analysis of the relaxation dynamics reveals that Raman processes dominate at higher temperatures, with systematic variations in relaxation parameters across the series. The systematic variations in magnetic anisotropy and slow magnetic relaxation behaviors of the three complexes correlate with the decreasing electronegativity of the halide ligands.",

Model solutions were prepared containing four target pollutants (50 mg/L each), Cu (II) at 50 mg/L, and a stoichiometric dose of hydrogen peroxide sufficient for complete oxidation of the organic matter. Chloride levels ranged from low concentrations to those representative of both synthetic and natural seawater (36 g/L NaCl). An increase in chloride concentration consistently led to greater pollutant removal efficiency. The influence of pH on process performance was also assessed in saline and real seawater matrices. An optimal pH range between 6 and 7 was identified in both cases, where the reactivity of copper–chloride complexes was maximized while the formation of insoluble, catalytically inactive copper species was suppressed. Monitoring of pH, soluble copper concentration, and hydrogen peroxide consumption supported the conclusion that real seawater provides the most favorable conditions for copper–chloride catalyzed Fenton-like reactions. These results demonstrate the high potential of copper-based advanced oxidation processes in saline environments, particularly in applications where traditional methods exhibit limited efficiency.",

In this study, the electronic properties of dCor, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-3′-deoxyadenosine (OXOdCor), and 8-hydroxy-3′deoxyadenosie (HOdCor), together with their spin densities, charge distributions, and global reactive descriptors, have been taken into consideration at the M06-2x/6-31++G** level of theory in the aqueous phase. It was found that dCor predominantly adopts a 3′-endo,anti conformation, while OXOdCor and HOdCor adopt a 2′-endo,syn conformation. Also, the keto form of oxidised dCor was found to be energetically preferred to its enolic form. The adiabatic ionisation potentials (AIPs) were noted as follows (in eV): 6.29 for dCor, 6.21 for OXOdCor, and 6.17 for HOdCor. The lowest adiabatic electron affinity among all the discussed adenine nucleosides analogues was assigned for OXOdCor at 1.12 eV. A thorough analysis of the spin density distribution of the adiabatic radical cation reveals that it has a higher accumulation at N6 > C5 > C8 > 3 of dCor, C5 > N6 > N7 > O8 of OXOdCor, and N6 > C5 > C8 > C2 of HOdCor. The results suggest that Cordycepin is more easily converted to OXOdCor and HOdCor than canonical adenine nucleosides. Much like typical drugs, after its administration and release, Cordycepin is exposed to various physiological factors and can be exposed to ionisation radiation during combined therapy. These factors can influence the therapeutic potential of Cordycepin. Therefore, further studies on its stability are of utmost importance.",

The molecular mechanism showed that PAE regulated the expression of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in K562 cells. Confocal laser observation showed that PAE damaged the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced ROS generation. Further evaluations indicated that PAE targeted HSP70 and inactivated the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, thereby inhibiting its downstream proteins.

Therefore, the question of how we can modify CPC and further improve the various properties of calcium phosphate bone cement is a current research hotspot. In this paper, the preparation conditions and technology of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) were optimized; chitosan oligosaccharide (COSM) with MW ≤ 3000 Da was added to the optimal formulation of biphasic calcium phosphate cement particles, and its physical and chemical properties were characterized. The results showed that BCP bone cement carrier for clinical operations was successfully constructed by the high-temperature solid-state reaction method, and COSM-BCP bone cement particles were obtained by loading COSM drugs with an angiogenesis effect. Its formula is biphasic calcium phosphate powder with the molar ratio of α-TCP/β-TCP of 1. The curing time of the prepared BCP particles is 24 ± 1 min, the compressive strength is 29.58 ± 1.89 MPa, and the porosity reaches 52.09%. The loaded COSM can be released continuously and stably in vitro, and has the effect of promoting angiogenesis. The safety evaluation of COSM-BCP bone cement particles and the preliminary pharmacodynamic study of its angiogenesis in vitro provide a promising clinical application basis for the development of drug-loaded biological bone substitute materials.",

This study aimed to assess and enhance a QuEChERS-based extraction method coupled with gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for the quantification of pesticide residues in edible insects (bamboo caterpillars, house crickets, silkworm pupae, giant water bugs, and grasshoppers) by combining multiple individual insect specimens into a single, homogenized sample—five replicates were tested. The method was optimized by evaluating various extraction parameters and showed strong linearity for all 47 target pesticides, with correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.9940 to 0.9999. The limits of detection (LODs) varied between 1 and 10 µg/kg, while the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 10 to 15 µg/kg. Recovery studies conducted at three fortification levels (10, 100, and 500 µg/kg) revealed recoveries ranging from 64.54% to 122.12%, that over 97.87% of the pesticides exhibited satisfactory recoveries within the range of 70–120%, and relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 20%, between 1.86% and 6.02%. Matrix effects (%MEs) range from −33.01% to 24.04%, and to those that experienced no effect. More than 94% of the analytes showed minimal ion suppression or enhancement. These results conform to the SANTE guidelines for monitoring pesticide residues in edible insects, enhancing food safety standards and safeguarding consumer protection.",

    "abstract": "Tunnel-structured Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) has been extensively studied as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its favorable cycling endurance, cost-effectiveness, environmental benignity, and notable air-moisture stability. However, limitations, such as sluggish ion diffusion kinetics, an insufficient Na+ storage capacity, and an unsatisfactory Jahn–Teller effect, impede its widespread application. To address these problems, this study proposes a co-doping strategy that involves the simultaneous introduction of a cation and an anion. The optimized cathode Na0.44Mn0.99Ni0.01O1.985F0.015 demonstrates remarkable rate capabilities with average discharge capacities of 136.2, 133.0, 129.6, 124.0, 115.9, and 95.8 mAh g−1 under current rates ranging from 0.1 to 5 C. Furthermore, it also exhibits exceptional long-term cyclability, retaining 86.5% and 89.4% capacity retention at 1 and 5 C after 200 and 400 cycles, respectively, accompanied by nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. A comprehensive structural characterization and experimental analysis reveal that the synergistic incorporation of Ni and F can effectively adjust the lattice parameters and alleviate the Jahn–Teller distortion of the NMO cathode, thereby resulting in enhanced structural integrity, rapid ion transfer dynamics, and excellent sodium storage performance. Consequently, this investigation establishes a significant approach for optimizing tunnel-phase Mn-based cathodes through the synergistic effect of cation and anion co-doping, which promotes the practical implementation of advanced SIBs.",

A Ru-based catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance in ammonia decomposition, and enhancing the interaction between the Ru atoms and the support is an important way to further improve its catalytic activity. In this study, CeO2 was prepared by calcination using a cerium-based metal–organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, and the number of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2 was regulated by hydrogen reduction. The XPS and Raman results showed that abundant oxygen vacancies were formed on the surface of these CeO2, and their number increased with an increase in the reduction time. The Ru/CeO2-4 h catalyst, using CeO2 reduced for 4 h as the support, exhibited good catalytic activity in ammonia decomposition, reaching 98.9% ammonia conversion and 39.74 mmol gcat−1 min−1 hydrogen yield under the condition of GHSV = 36,000 mL gcat−1 h−1 at 500 °C. The XAFS results demonstrated that Ru was stably anchored with oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2 via Ru-O-Ce bonds. Density functional theory calculations further showed that these bondings lower the reaction energy barrier for N-H bond cleavage, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic activity.",

Twelve acrylate monomers with functional groups like amino, halogen, and double-bond were introduced into PDLC films, and twelve samples were prepared. The electro-optical properties and microstructure of the films were characterized. The results show that compared to films with amino and halogen groups, those with hydroxyl groups have the best balance of driving voltage and contrast, achieving higher contrast at lower driving voltage, making this preparation scheme ideal for low-voltage, high-contrast PDLC films. Also, in the presence of hydroxyl groups, introducing double bonds increases saturation voltage and decreases saturation. Hydrogen-bond engineering through strategically positioned hydroxyl groups in acrylate monomers optimizes PDLC performance by enabling compact polymer networks and controlled phase separation, achieving superior contrast ratios (163) and low saturation voltages (15.8 V), while amino groups induce steric limitations and dual-bond systems that disrupt hydrogen-bond efficacy, highlighting hydroxyl spatial design as critical for electro-optical optimization.",

The utilization of natural compounds in emulsion formulations is increasingly relevant for those applications where it is challenging to maintain a low impact on the environment and health. We report here a study on saponin and chitosan at the interface between water and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil in relation to the properties of the corresponding emulsions. Complementary experimental approaches have been adopted to investigate interfacial properties and emulsion evolution, relying on drop tensiometry, optical and confocal microscopy, and light transmission/scattering analysis. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation has been undertaken as support for the interpretation of the experimental results. The multi-technique investigation adopted here enabled a better understanding of saponin adsorption properties and of the role of chitosan in emulsion evolution. In particular, the results evidence the formation of amphiphilic saponin–chitosan complexes, which adsorb at the liquid–liquid interface and improve the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Since the system investigated mainly consists of natural compounds, the results of this work can contribute to the development of new and efficient low-impact formulations.",

The development of new lysosome-imaging-guided AIEgens for the photodynamic therapy of cancer cells is important. In this work, two novel organic compounds with AIE characteristics, namely, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3, were designed and synthesized by introducing the weakly basic morpholinyl moiety with lysosome-targeting ability into a triphenylamine-based luminogen. The distorted spatial feature of TPA and the D1-D2-π-A structure of these AIEgens prevented the aggregation-caused quenching of traditional fluorescent molecules and efficiently promoted the separation of the HOMO and LUMO. The outcomes were AIE features and a narrow single-triplet energy gap. Furthermore, TPAB-CF3 and TPAB-diCF3 showed bright yellow fluorescence emission peaks at 577 and 601 nm; large Stokes shifts of 234 and 256 nm, respectively; and excellent lysosome-targeted imaging of HeLa cells (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.90). In addition to the good 1O2-generation ability under light irradiation, these AIEgens achieved the high-efficiency bright lysosome imaging-guided photodynamic killing of cancer cells under white-light irradiation.",

Therefore, the search for a new alternative energy technology has become a focus of attention. The long-established Fischer–Tropsch synthesis technology and the recent CO2 hydrogenation technology with unlimited potential seem to be among the ways to solve the above problems. Among them, the development of efficient Fe-based catalysts has become a key issue. Weaker interactions on carbon supports are more favourable for the formation of active phases in Fe-based catalysts than stronger metal–support interactions on conventional oxide supports. In this work, we systematically summarise the application of various types of carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, graphene, activated carbon, etc.) in COx hydrogenation reactions. The effects of different structural types of carriers on the dispersion of active sites are discussed. At the same time, the effects of different carrier preparation methods on catalytic performance are compared. In addition, the role of surface modifications to carbon materials in the promotion of active sites is discussed. Finally, we propose possible research directions based on the current problems in these catalytic systems. The aim is to provide a reference for the development of new carbon materials and their application in COx hydrogenation.",

    "abstract": "Indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Previous studies in airway smooth muscle demonstrated that chronic exposure to testosterone (TES, 40 nM) enhances the relaxation induced by salbutamol and theophylline due to K+ channel increment, without modifying cyclooxygenase expression. This study examines how indomethacin, ibuprofen, and ASA affect K+ currents and the relaxation response to these bronchodilators. In organ baths, tracheas from young male guinea pigs chronically (48 h) treated with 40 nM TES showed increased relaxation to salbutamol and theophylline, which was completely abolished by indomethacin. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that TES increased salbutamol- and theophylline-induced K+ currents, and only indomethacin fully inhibited this potentiation; ibuprofen and ASA had partial effects. The involved currents included voltage-dependent K+ (KV) and high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. Our results demonstrate that indomethacin exerts a dual action, inhibiting K+ channel activity and PG synthesis, unlike ibuprofen and ASA. This dual mechanism explains its stronger inhibitory effect on TES-enhanced ASM relaxation. These findings suggest that indomethacin may counteract the protective effects of TES, which promotes anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle-relaxing states. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution when prescribing indomethacin to young males with asthma, as the protective role of TES may diminish, potentially resulting in an exacerbation of asthma symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials (CMs) have gained great attention as heterogeneous catalysts in water treatment because of their high efficiency and potential contribution to achieving carbon neutrality. Expanded graphite (EG) is ideal for studying CMs because the reactivity in CMs largely depends on graphitic structures, and most surface of EG is exposed, minimizing mass transfer resistance. However, EG is poor in adsorption and catalysis. In this study, EG was modified by simple thermal treatment to investigate the effects of characteristics of graphitic structures on reactivity. Tetracycline (TC) removal rate via activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) by the EG treated at 550 °C (EG550) was more than 10 times that of EG. The thermal modification did not significantly increase surfaces but led to increases in damaged, rough surfaces, graphitization degree, C content, defects, and C=O. Radical and non-radical pathways, such as SO4•−, O2•−, 1O2, and electron transfer, were involved in TC removal in EG550+PDS. TC degradation in EG550+PDS was initiated by hydroxylation, followed by demethylation, dehydroxylation, decarbonylation, and ring-opening. The ions ubiquitous in water systems did not significantly affect the performance of EG550+PDS, except for H2PO4− and HCO3−, suggesting the high potential of practical applications. This study demonstrated that graphitic structure itself and surface area are not detrimental in the catalytic reactivity of CMs, which is different from previous studies. Rather, the reactivity is governed by the characteristics, i.e., defects and functional groups of the graphitic structure. It is thought that this study provides valuable insights into the development of highly reactive CMs and the catalytic systems using them.",

The effects of mephedrone on cell viability and proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression and the type of cell death were studied. Our results showed that mephedrone possesses potential anticancer activity. The viability and proliferation of all four human glioblastoma and human anaplastic astrocytoma cell lines used were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Studies conducted on LN-18 and T98G cells confirmed the significant antiproliferative properties of mephedrone, which reduced DNA synthesis and affected cell cycle progression. Microscopic evaluation supported the antiproliferative effect of the tested compounds. Moreover, substantial cytoplasmic vacuolization in the LN-18 cell line was revealed.

    "abstract": "Coupling organic light-harvesting materials with lead halide perovskite quantum dots (LHP QDs) is an attractive approach that could provide great potential in optoelectronic applications owing to the diversity of organic materials available and the intriguing optical and electronic properties of LHP QDs. Here, we demonstrate energy collection by CsPbI3 QDs from a near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting upconversion system. The upconversion system consists of Pd-tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(p-methoxycarbonylphenyl)-tetraanthraporphyrin (PdTAP) as the sensitizer to harvest NIR photons and rubrene as the annihilator to generate upconverted photons via triplet fusion. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra reveal that CsPbI3 QDs are energized via radiative energy transfer from the singlet excited rubrene with photophysics fidelity of respective components. In addition, a volumetric display demo incorporating CsPbI3 QDs as light emitters employing triplet fusion upconversion was developed, showing bright luminescent images from CsPbI3 QDs. These results present the feasibility of integrating organic light-harvesting systems and perovskite QDs, enabling diverse light harvesting and activation of perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.",

    "abstract": "In the natural environment, mechanical energy is widely available as a sustainable and green energy source. In this paper, we successfully convert mechanical energy on ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 tribocatalysts via a friction route. Electrons were transferred across the contact interface when the catalyst particles and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-sealed magnetic bar rubbed against each other under magnetic stirring. At the same time, holes were left on the catalyst while the PTFE absorbed the electrons. Similar to photocatalysis, organic pollutants can be effectively oxidized by the holes in the valence band of sol-gel catalysts due to their strong oxidative ability. The tribocatalytic tests demonstrated that ZnO and ZnO/Eu2O3 could eliminate organic analgesics (paracetamol) under magnetic stirring in the dark. By controlling the quantity of rare earth elements (1, 2, and 3 mol%), stirring speed, and the number of magnetic rods, we could further enhance the tribocatalytic performance. In addition to developing a green tribocatalysis approach for the oxidative purification of organic pollutants, this work offers a potential route for converting environmental mechanical energy into chemical energy, which could be used in sustainable energy and environmental remediation.",

The effective removal of PPCPs remains challenging for conventional water treatment technologies, whereas photocatalytic technology has shown distinct promise. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a ubiquitous component of aquatic ecosystems, exerts multifaceted effects on the photocatalytic oxidation of PPCPs. In this article, the influence of DOM on the performance of various photocatalysts in PPCP removal is systematically summarized and analyzed. This review highlights DOM’s role in altering the migration and transformation of PPCPs via processes including adsorption and complexation. The adsorption of PPCPs on photocatalysts is achieved by competitive adsorption or by providing more adsorption sites. DOM modifies the structural properties of photocatalysts through mechanisms such as ligand exchange, intermolecular forces, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions. DOM inhibits the formation of active species via light attenuation and shielding effects while simultaneously enhancing their generation through photosensitization and electron transfer facilitation. In this review, the interaction mechanism among DOM, PPCPs, and photocatalysts within the PPCP photocatalytic oxidation system is expounded on. These findings provide novel insights into optimizing photocatalytic reaction conditions and enhancing treatment efficiency, while providing a theoretical foundation for advancing efficient, eco-friendly PPCPs remediation technologies.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanofibrous materials from electrospinning are good candidate electrode materials for supercapacitor applications due to their straightforward processability, chemical stability, high porosity, and large surface area. In this research, a straightforward and effective way was revealed to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon nanofibrous electrode material from electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Fluorination of the electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNF) was studied by comparing two types of hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment, i.e., direct HF acid treatment on ECNF (Type I) vs. HF acid treatment on the stabilized PAN (Type II) followed by carbonization. The latter was found to be an advantageous way to introduce C-F bonds in the resultant carbon nanofibrous electrode material that contributed to pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the Type II HF acid treatment demonstrated exciting synergistic effects with ECNF aerogel formation on carbon structure and porosity development and generated a superior fluorinated electrospun carbon nanofibrous aerogel (ECNA-F) electrode material for supercapacitor uses. The resultant ECNA-F electrode material demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with great cyclic stability due to the large improvements in both pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance. ECNA-F achieved a specific capacitance of 372 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, and the device with ECNA-F and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte possessed an energy density of 29.1 Wh/kg at a power density of 275 W/kg. This study provided insight into developing high-performance and stable carbon nanofibrous electrode materials for supercapacitors.",

Our study investigates metalloporphyrins with central 3d-metals from Sc to Cu and chalcogen containing anchoring groups such as -SH, -SeH, and -TeH substituted at the meso-position of the porphyrin rings. We carried out Density Function Theory (DFT)-based calculations to determine the ground state geometry, spin multiplicity, spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals, and electronic structure descriptors to gain insights into the reactivity trends and possible impact on factors influencing electron transport properties. The results suggest that the central metal shapes the spin multiplicity, while variations between sulfur, selenium, and tellurium play a role in charge distribution. This study provides insights into how the selection of the central metal and control of spin channels influence the electronic structure and reactivity of metalloporphyrin molecules. The knowledge provided here can play a role in the design of porphyrin-based molecular materials for diverse applications in molecular junctions, catalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing.",

    "abstract": "A new active composite film intended for bread packaging is described here. The active film has the aim of prolonging bread’s shelf life while avoiding the use of nanoparticles that, with very few exceptions, are a type of material not allowed by regulatory agencies like EFSA (European Food Safety Agency) and FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) in food contact materials. Moreover, the increasing consumer demand for natural and wholesome products, possibly “clean label”, and packaged in natural, non-petroleum-based materials has been taken into consideration. Accordingly, precursor materials from renewable sources were used to prepare the active film: pectin from citrus peel (PEC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were used as the matrix, with oleic acid (OA) as plasticizer. Moreover, the bread preservative calcium propionate (CaP) was used as the crosslinker, and also zeolite microparticles loaded with silver ions (AgZ) were added to the films as an additional antimold agent. This strategy allows us to avoid the addition to bread of the now commonly used preservatives ethanol and calcium propionate, moving the latter to the packaging. Permeance measurements revealed excellent barrier properties against O2 and CO2, while the typical high water vapor permeance of polysaccharide films was mitigated by the non-hydrophilic OA plasticizer. Moreover, the quantities of Ag+ and CaP released in bread are low and below the limits imposed by regulatory agencies. The antimold activity of the films is excellent, with Aspergillus niger, Penicillium janthinellum, and wild-type Penicillim molds reduction on bread in the 99.20–99.95% range for the films containing only CaP and in the 99.97–99.998% range for the films containing both CaP and AgZ. Finally, the rheological properties of the film-forming solutions were investigated, demonstrating their potential application as coatings on natural packaging materials for bread, such as paper.",

These thermally allowed [4+2] cycloadditions were taking place with normal electron demand due to rather electron-deficient dienophiles and relatively electron-rich dienes; however, they still required quite harsh reaction conditions: heating in closed vessels at 190 °C for up to 17 h was sufficient in most cases (albeit for a few reactions the time needed was up to 58 h) to achieve conversions above 95%. Such conditions, unfortunately, necessitated the use of a larger excess of dienophiles (as undesired polymerization takes place concomitantly); nevertheless, the straightforward isolation procedures enabled access to the target compounds in moderate to high yields (average yield 56%). All products were characterized by standard analytical and spectroscopic methods. With the goal of changing the reaction conditions to be more environmentally friendly, we investigated the effect of various solvents (water, n-butanol, butyl acetate, xylene, para-cymene, n-nonane, etc.) and the temperature applied (130–190 °C) on the conversion. We found that higher temperatures are necessary in most cases (except for the most reactive 2H-pyran-2-ones) regardless of the solvent used. Relative reactivity was determined for both sets of reactants and the experimentally obtained data show good agreement with the computational results.",

Hydrolysis was conducted in a controlled environment using phosphate-buffered saline at 70 °C to isolate the impact of hydrolytic degradation on the polymer’s properties. The consequent changes in molecular weight characteristics were tracked using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), revealing a decrease in both weight average molecular weight (Mw) and an increase in polydispersity index (PDI) as hydrolysis progressed. The thermal behavior of PBSA during hydrolysis was thoroughly investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which demonstrated significant changes in melting temperature (Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg), and crystallinity (X). These changes in Tm and Tg suggest a change in copolymer composition, likely due to the greater susceptibility of the adipic acid unit to hydrolysis compared to the succinic acid unit. Furthermore, polarized optical microscopy (POM) was employed to observe the morphological evolution of PBSA, showing a transition from spherulitic structures in the early stages of hydrolysis to dendritic structures with prolonged hydrolysis time. The decrease in nucleation activity led to a reduction in the number of spherulites, which in turn allowed the remaining spherulites to grow larger.",

    "abstract": "Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine is a nitrogen-containing fused heterocycle that imitates the nitrogenous base adenine with varying degrees of reliability. This fact determines its frequent use in drug design, including the development of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. These include dorsomorphin which shows compromised kinase selectivity but is still widely used as an AMPK inhibitor. ATP-binding pockets of many proteins have a fairly conservative spatial structure and there is a high probability of obtaining a compound with low target selectivity during drug development. In the case of a common scaffold, the careful selection of side substituents that determine the activity and selectivity of the final compound plays an important role. In this work, a convergent strategy for the synthesis of dorsomorphin and its close analogs was developed and implemented. The resulting small series of compounds is distinguished by the maximum possible diversification and allows for an assessment of the biological activity towards AMPK. An original route to obtain variants of the phenoxy-alkylamine moiety of dorsomorphin via the Mitsunobu reaction will be useful for generating targeted-focused libraries of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors and highly active receptor ligands.",

    "abstract": "Broccoli, a highly valued Brassica vegetable, is renowned for its rich content of bioactive substances, including glucosinolates, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and essential minerals. Glucosinolates (GSLs), secondary plant metabolites, are particularly abundant in broccoli. The global consumption of broccoli has increased due to its high nutritional value. This review examines the essential bioactive compounds in broccoli and their biological properties. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that broccoli exhibits various biological activities, including antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity and antidiabetic effects. This review analyzes several aspects of the chemical and biological activity of GSLs and their hydrolysis products, isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane, as well as phenolic compounds. Particular emphasis is placed on sulforaphane’s chemical structure, the reactivity of its isothiocyanate fraction (-NCS), and given the different behavior of SFN enantiomers, a wide and detailed review of the chemical synthesis methods described, by microbial oxidation, or using a chiral ruthenium catalyst and more widely using chiral auxiliaries for synthesizing sulforaphane enantiomers. In addition, the methods of chiral resolution of racemates by HPLC are reviewed, explaining the different chiral fillers used for this resolution and a third section on resolution using the formation of diastereomeric complexes and subsequent separation on achiral columns. Additionally, this review highlights the presence of antimicrobial peptides in broccoli, which have shown potential applications in food preservation and as natural alternatives to synthetic antibiotics. The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from broccoli target bacterial membranes, enzymes, oxidative stress pathways and inflammatory mediators, contributing to their effectiveness against a wide range of pathogens and with potential therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "As the proportion of the elderly population increases, there is an urgent need for anti-aging technologies. Since the skin is the most visibly aging organ in the human body, it is crucial to develop active ingredients to slow down skin aging. Currently, identified anti-aging active substances include antioxidants, retinoids, peptides, growth factors, and compounds derived from biofermentation. However, they have limitations such as poor stability, low transdermal permeability, skin irritation, high effective concentrations, slow onset of efficacy, single-action mechanisms, and high production costs. These limitations highlight the necessity of developing new anti-aging technologies that are multifunctional and cause low irritation. This study aimed to investigate the anti-aging effects and mechanisms of fructosazine (FZ) and deoxyfructosazine (DOF) on the skin as well as their potential applications in skincare. The methods included ELISA tests to assess the viability of human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells and related factors, and monitoring in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The results showed that FZ promoted cell viability. Both FZ and DOF enhanced the secretion of type I collagen (Col I) and hyaluronic acid (HA), inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), boosted catalase (CAT), and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and β-galactosidase. They also nourished the epidermis and increased fiber content. In conclusion, FZ and DOF can stimulate the production of anti-aging substances, exhibit antioxidant activity, and have potential in skincare.",

Due to their excellent biological properties, the aerial parts and flowers of Lavandula peduncolata ssp. have been utilized in traditional medicine in Morocco and western Europe. This paper investigated the chemical composition and antibacterial activities as well as the antibiofilm and antioxidant activities of the essential oil (EO) obtained from the pre-flowering aerial parts of Lavandula pedunculata subsp. atlantica collected in Morocco. The chemical composition of the EO, obtained by classic hydrodistillation, showed by GC-MS analysis the presence of a large amount of oxygenated monoterpene compounds. The main constituents of the EO were camphor (27.8%), camphene (10.9%), fenchone (10.6%), and eucalyptol (8.5%). The EO has been evaluated for its antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showing promising activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. These findings highlight the potential of Lavandula EO in combating infections caused by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus oralis (oral diseases), Staphylococcus aureus (skin infections), Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei (gastrointestinal and urinary infections). In addition, although the EO showed no evident effects on cell viability in eukaryotic epithelial cells, it exhibited promising effects on anti-inflammatory properties.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent chronic degenerative joint disorder marked by cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation. Despite its widespread occurrence, effective pharmacological interventions to halt or reverse OA progression remain elusive. Thus, an in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis is imperative for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Methods: Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, weighing 180–220 g) were randomly assigned to two groups: the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) group and the sham-operated group. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the subchondral bone at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after ACLT. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was used to elucidate metabolic changes and the underlying mechanisms in osteoblasts. Results: A total of 26 metabolites were identified from the NMR spectra of osteoblasts. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in the ACLT group at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. In particular, several differential metabolites were identified, including glucose, lactate, NADP+, phosphocreatine, and alanine, as well as eight perturbed pathways, such as alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and taurine metabolism. Conclusions: Key energy-related metabolites, including glucose, lactate, creatine phosphate, and creatine, were identified as key markers of osteoblast dysfunction in OA, underscoring the profound metabolic perturbations induced by ACL injury. These disturbances in energy homeostasis are strongly implicated in the progression of OA. In addition, branched-chain amino acids emerged as potential biomarkers, further highlighting the metabolic dysregulation associated with the disease. Taken together, the metabolic changes observed in rat osteoblasts following ACL injury reveal a complex interplay between energy and amino acid metabolism, providing critical insights into the pathogenesis of post-traumatic OA and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily defined by the deterioration of motor function and characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Although it is the second most prevalent disorder of the central nervous system, current treatments primarily focus on symptom management and modestly slowing disease progression, ultimately failing to preserve the long-term quality of life of a substantial proportion of affected individuals. Innovative therapies that can restore neuronal function have emerged, such as the use of the secretome of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) due to their rich composition of bioactive molecules. This therapy exhibits robust paracrine activity that drives most of the self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential, and immune regulation of MSCs without presenting compatibility issues often associated with stem cell-based therapies. While conceptually appealing, the clinical application of this approach is still limited by the availability and proliferation capacity of MSCs, as it impacts not only secretome production but also its quality. Various protocols have been developed to enhance secretome action by adding various compounds to cell culture media, given the high environmental plasticity of MSCs. Some of the compounds already used are Caloric Restriction Mimetics (CRMs), molecules that mimic Caloric Restriction (CR) conditions, which have been demonstrated to extend lifespan and reduce age-related diseases in various organisms. While not sufficient to cure neurodegenerative disorders, these compounds may potentiate secretome efficiency by enhancing autophagy pathways and relieving oxidative stress burden from MSCs. Therefore, in this article, we aim to explore the effects of CRMs priming on MSCs and how it may help bridge existing gaps in regenerative therapies for PD.",

SOD1 mutations have a significant role in the pathophysiology and fast behavior of protopathic proteins in ALS illness. The E100K mutation may be useful in uncovering the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1 associated with ALS. According to several studies, giving small molecule inhibitors made from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds may be a viable treatment strategy for neurological conditions. Using molecular docking and MD simulations, we have identified a potential flavonoid drug that may successfully inhibit SOD1’s amyloidogenic activity. Puerarin, Fisetin, and Peonidin provided intriguing pharmacological hints during the initial screening of flavonoids. The Fisetin-E100K complex had a larger residual energy contribution and substantial binding than other flavonoid compounds. The findings showed that, unlike other materials, Fisetin increased the structural stability, hydrophobicity, and flexibility of the mutant while reducing the amount of β-sheets. Furthermore, to distinguish aggregation in the mutant (unbound/bound) states, we displayed modifications in the free energy landscape (FEL). As a result, Fisetin was identified as having therapeutic potential against the E100K, which might make it a viable pharmacological option for the creation of inhibitors that lower the chance of ALS death.",

This study reports for the first time the implementation of the microbial dye violacein, obtained by Janthinobacterium lividum batch cultivation, as SERS probe, as a suitable substitutive to the most employed toxic chemical dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). The interaction of the proposed natural probe with the metal surface after the adsorption and the presence of local electromagnetic fields were evaluated by computational approach. The SERS devices developed were decorated by applying a single-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) decoration method and characterized using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The platform showed a remarkable sensitivity, achieving a detection limit of 10–7 M for violacein, allowing to point out the strong potential of this natural microbial dye as a sustainable probe molecule for low-concentration analytes detection on SERS-active substrates, making them suitable for several application fields, such as environmental monitoring, food safety, cultural heritage analysis and diagnostics.

Despite its importance, the specific details regarding N/O-glycosylation within human semen proteins have largely remained unknown. To address this challenge, an integrated glycoproteomic platform (termed GlycoIP) was developed, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both intact N- and O-glycopeptides directly from human semen samples. Characterizing these intact glycopeptides is particularly challenging, yet it provides invaluable insights into the structure and function of both glycans and their attachment sites. In this study, our platform enabled the identification of 1,833 unique N-glycopeptides and 720 unique O-glycopeptides. This approach revealed extensive and precise site-specific N/O-glycosylation data, highlighting 438 potential O-glycosylation sites from 148 distinct O-glycoproteins. Notably, we conducted site-specific N/O-glycosylation profiling on several unique glycoproteins, including sperm equatorial segment protein 1 (SPESP1), which is located on human sperm, and plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), which is presented in both sperm and seminal plasma. In summary, this platform provides a promising approach for comprehensive profiling of protein site-specific N/O-glycosylation within a single experiment. This advancement paves the way for further functional studies on glycoproteins and their roles in male infertility, enhancing our understanding of this complex field.",

This study aimed to optimize the therapeutic potential of brevinin-1pl, a frog-derived AMP with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities.MethodsMajor experimental approaches encompassed antibacterial activity evaluation, hemolytic potential assessment, bactericidal rate determination via time-kill kinetics, SYTOX Green-based membrane integrity analysis, and MTT assays for anti-proliferative effects.ResultsSubstitutions with arginine (brevinin-1pl-2R and brevinin-1pl-5R) enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria but reduced efficacy against Gram-negative strains. Lysine substitution (brevinin-1pl-6K) decreased activity against Gram-positive bacteria due to reduced hydrophobicity. In contrast, histidine substitution (brevinin-1pl-3H) showed diminished activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., MRSA MIC increased from 2 µM to 4 µM) but reduced hemolysis, indicating improved selectivity. Mechanistic studies using SYTOX green assays confirmed membrane disruption as a primary mode of action, while suggesting alternative mechanisms for Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The brevinin-1pl and its analogues demonstrated significant inhibitory efficacy against both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and H838 non-small cell lung cancer cells at a concentration of 10–4 M. Notably, brevinin-1pl-3H exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal HaCaT cells despite its high hydrophobicity, suggesting potential for dermatological applications.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that strategic amino acid substitutions can optimize the therapeutic potential of AMPs, offering a promising approach to develop peptides with enhanced efficacy and reduced clinical side effects.",

Secondly, focused microwaves enhance energy absorption and reduce coal moisture, while non-focusing radiation alters coal composition by increasing volatile matter and decreasing fixed carbon. Finally, non-focusing modes improve coal combustibility and reduce particulate emissions with minimal environmental impact, contrasting with focused microwaves limited ecological effects.

We have used two types of oxide nanoparticles, namely, Al2O3 and γ- Al2O3, with water and C2H6O2. The purpose of this study is to investigate an innovative comparative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid flow and heat transport with the impact of thermal radiation on water and ethylene glycol (EG) suspended with Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. A novel comparison of concentration of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ Al2O3–C2H6O2 nanofluids is investigated under the influence of chemical reactions. The system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was obtained via a similarity transformation and then solved using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) in Mathematica. The temperature and velocity profiles are obtained numerically for a range of controlling parameter values, including the volume percentage φ of nanomaterials, the magnetic effect parameter M, the radiation parameter Rd, and Eckert number Ec in convergent/divergent channels. The concentration profiles of Al2O3–H2O, γ-Al2O3–H2O, and γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 tri-nanofluids are calculated numerically for governing parameter values, including those accounting for chemical reactions. The investigation’s findings indicate that there is greater heat transport in γ-Al2O3–C2H6O2 and γ-Al2O3–H2O than in Al2O3–H2O.

    "abstract": "Trifluoromethylation stands as a pivotal technology in modern synthetic chemistry, playing an indispensable role in drug design, functional material development, and agrochemical innovation. With the growing emphasis on green chemistry principles, the pursuit of environmentally benign trifluoromethylation strategies has emerged as a critical research frontier. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), characterized by its cost-effectiveness, stability, and low toxicity, has become a promising alternative to conventional trifluoromethylation reagents. This review systematically summarizes advancements in photocatalytic decarboxylative trifluoromethylation using TFA and its derivatives over the past decade, focusing on three key activation mechanisms: single-electron transfer (SET), electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-mediated pathways, and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This paradigm shift is driven by the intrinsic limitations of conventional thermal decarboxylation, particularly its reliance on harsh conditions and significant environmental burdens. In contrast, photocatalytic strategies enable efficient C–CF3 bond construction under mild conditions, offering a modular platform for synthesizing fluorinated functional molecules. Strategic research priorities should focus on overcoming fundamental challenges, including but not limited to optimizing photosensitizer catalytic efficiency, establishing regioselective manipulation strategies, and engineering multicomponent tandem reaction systems to achieve trifluoromethylation methodologies under mild conditions. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic investigations with artificial intelligence-driven reaction prediction will accelerate the advancement of precision trifluoromethylation technologies. This progress is anticipated to provide sustainable synthetic solutions for next-generation fluorinated pharmaceuticals and advanced functional materials, effectively bridging the innovation gap between academic research and industrial implementation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAlcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is a common consequence of chronic alcohol consumption, characterized by lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes play essential roles in metabolizing alcohol and other compounds. However, the specific long-term effects of alcohol on these enzymes remain unclear.MethodsThis study the examines influence of prolonged ethanol exposure on CYP450 activity and expression in AFLD using a rat model. Key enzymes such as CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1 were assessed in relation to lipid accumulation and oxidative stress.ResultsSignificant alterations were identified in the expression and activity of CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A1, which were associated with increased lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. Additionally, the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was elevated, suggesting that chronic alcohol intake may impact drug transport and excretion.DiscussionThese findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AFLD and highlight the potential of CYP450 modulation as a therapeutic target. By elucidating how long-term ethanol exposure disrupts hepatic CYP450 enzyme profiles, this research lays the groundwork for developing personalized therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients with AFLD.",

    "abstract": "Today, wastewater treatment is essential and inevitable due to the water crisis caused by climate change and population growth. Although numerous methods and synthetic compounds have been successful in practical and laboratory applications, developing novel multifunctional compounds remains of interest to scientists. For this purpose, a new nanofiber containing Cobalt-MOF (metal-organic framework), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which are known environmentally friendly polymers, was synthesized. After characterization and structure determination, the nanofiber was investigated for its ability to adsorb Congo Red dye and inhibit known microbial species in wastewater. This study showed that 91% of the 400 mg/L Congo red solution was absorbed by 0.06 g/L of the synthesized Cobalt-MOF/PVA-PVP Nanofibers at 1 h. Additionally, seven well-known strains (including Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Giardia lamblia) in wastewater were inhibited (with MIC of 8 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL) to the extent that some antibiotics could not affect them. This performance of the newly synthesized nanofiber can be attributed to its physical, chemical, and structural characteristics, such as compounds with biological properties present in its structure, as well as its high specific surface area. Therefore, researching and synthesizing similar compounds using the method presented in this study can lead to their development and application in wastewater treatment processes.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly efficient, recyclable adsorbents for heavy metal remediation remains a critical challenge in environmental engineering. This study introduces a novel cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-functionalized magnesium silicate (CTAB/MS) nano-adsorbent was synthesized through a multi-step surface modification of serpentinite involving intercalation with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol treatment, and CTAB incorporation. The resulting nanostructure was extensively characterized and applied for the removal of cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), and copper (Cu2+) ions from contaminated water. The characterization findings confirmed significant morphological and structural modifications, including enhanced surface area, functional group availability, and mesoporosity, which contributed to enhanced adsorption performance. The kinetic modeling confirmed that the process predominantly followed a pseudo-first-order model, suggesting that rapid physisorption mechanisms controlled the initial adsorption phase. Equilibrium studies revealed that adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous active sites, with maximum adsorption capacities of 491.9 mg/g (Cd2+), 481.8 mg/g (Co2+), and 434.3 mg/g (Cu2+) at 303 K. Furthermore, statistical physics-based isotherm model incorporating steric and energetic parameters provided deeper mechanistic insights. The adsorption energy (ΔE) values remained below 12.66 kJ/mol, confirming a predominantly physical adsorption process, while thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic and spontaneous nature, as evidenced by negative free enthalpy (G) and internal energy (Eint) values. The recyclability assessment demonstrated that CTAB/MS retained over 70% of its adsorption efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles, underscoring its long-term applicability in water treatment. This highlights the potential of CTAB/MS as an advanced, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for large-scale water purification.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAstragali Radix (AR) - Curcumae Rhizoma (vinegar processed, CR) herb pair was recorded in ‘YIXUE ZHONGZHONG CANXILU’ to treat colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Hedysari Radix (HR) was categorized under the AR entry in ‘SHENNONG BENCAO JING’. HR is still an alternative to AR paired with CR clinically in northwest China. Hedysari Radix Praeparata Cum Melle (HRPCM) is a product that HR fries with honey to enhance the therapeutic effect. However, the mechanism of HRPCM paired with CR (HRCR) in CAC needs to be further elucidated.MethodsHRCR-MIAS were prepared using the eversion intestinal sac method. UHPLC Q-Exactive-MS investigated the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. Then, the mechanism of HRCR in CAC mice was predicted based on network pharmacology analysis in combination with the compositions in HRCR-MIAS. The pharmacodynamic effects of HRCR-MIAS for SW620 colon cancer cells were invested in vitro. The efficacies of HRCR low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (HRCR-L, 3.413 g/kg; HRCR-M, 6.825 g/kg; HRCR-H, 13.650 g/kg) in CAC mice were explored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to assay The inflammatory factors levels, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum. The expressions of the intestinal permeability proteins, such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1, were detected via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Finally, the predicted signalling was verified by Western blot (WB).Results855 common components were identified in HRCR and HRCR-MIAS, and 25 specific components in HRCR-MIAS were pointed out. Based on network pharmacology analysis, the inflammatory response and the cross-linked MAPK signalling and NF-kB signalling were predicted to be the main reasons for HRCR in CAC. HRCR-MIAS inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, regulated the cell cycle progression, and restrained the SW620 cells’ ability to migrate and invade in vitro. The outcomes of the WB experiment exhibited that HRCR-MIAS inhibited the expression of key proteins such as MEKK1, RAS, ERK, IKB and NF-kB in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling pathway of SW620 cells. The study in vivo found that the different doses of HRCR recovered the loss of body weight, the shortened colon length, the increased tumour counts, the abnormal changes in spleen and thymus indices, the colonic lesions, the unbalanced inflammatory factors levels like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, and the down-regulated intestinal permeability proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Experimental validation by WB confirmed that HRCR inhibited the expression of the key proteins, including MEKK1 RAS, ERK, IKB, and NF-kB, in the MAPK/NF-kB signalling in CAC mice.DiscussionHRCR not only suppresses the process of colonic inflammation and improves intestinal permeability but also relieves CAC by inhibiting the activated MAPK/NF-kB signalling cascade to alleviate CAC.",

    "abstract": "Epoxy zinc-rich coatings usually require high zinc content to ensure its anti-corrosion performance. However, excessive zinc powder content will reduce the mechanical properties of the coating, increase the economic cost, harm the environment, etc. Therefore, this paper aims to reduce the amount of zinc powder and improve the corrosion performance of epoxy zinc-rich coatings by introducing two kinds of conductive particle materials, conductive graphene-mica powder and conductive nickel. Conductive graphene was first loaded on mica powder and the obtained conductive graphene-mica powder and the conductive nickel were introduced to the epoxy zinc-rich coatings to partially replace zinc component. The anti-corrosion properties of the coating were systematically evaluated by EIS and salt spray test. The resulting epoxy zinc-rich coating with nickel powder or conductive graphene-mica demonstrates outstanding salt spray resistance, lasting up to 2,000 h, exhibiting superior anti-corrosion performance at reduced zinc content of 60% or 45% compared to conventional coatings with 70% pure zinc powder. This study introduces a novel conductive mica material and investigates conductive metal nickel additive, effectively reducing zinc content in epoxy zinc-rich coatings, which offers valuable insights for developing high-performance anti-corrosion coatings.",

    "abstract": "Baihuasheshecao (Scleromitrion diffusum (Willd.) R.J. Wang), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is extensively used as an ingredient in herbal teas and is a well-known folk medicine in China. However, two common adulterants, Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. and Hedyotis tenelliflora (BL.) Kuntze, belonging to the same family, are frequently mistaken as S. diffusum in folk medicine. This confusion has led to a growing concern about their identification and quality evaluation. While previous studies have demonstrated over 15 various compounds as potential chemical markers for authentication and quality control for S. diffusum, considering the selection criteria for chemical markers in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, most of these compounds do not meet the pharmacopoeial requirements. Hence, this study aims to identify an appropriate chemical marker for S. diffusum based on thin layer chromatography (TLC) identification and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quality control, in order to differentiate from any counterfeits such as H. corymbosa and H. tenelliflora. Our findings suggested for the first time that the compound (E)-6-O-(p-coumaroyl) scandoside methyl ester which is specific to S. diffusum, could serve as the chemical marker. Here, attempt was made to establish standardized protocols for TLC identification, HPLC analysis, and quantitative methodologies, adhering to Chinese pharmacopoeial standards, along with laboratory scale preparation procedures. In conclusion, our findings have provided valuable insights to the identification and quality control processes for S. diffusum, and anticipated with potential applications by the industry and regulatory authority.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are natural organic compounds that are derivatives of diphenylpropane. This group of polyphenols can be found in multiple natural sources and they exhibit a variety of biological effects. Despite the wide array of beneficial properties, the development of drugs based on these compounds is hindered by their low bioavailability. Although the substantial body of information available on strategies to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of flavonoids, this knowledge remains fragmented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to consolidate and systematize scientific data on methods for increasing the solubility and bioavailability of flavonoid compounds without changing their initial molecular structures. Throughout the investigation, it was determined that the most prevalent methods for increasing solubility and bioavailability include co-crystallization, formation of phospholipid and inclusion complexes, and the creation of nanostructures. Although there were no pronounced differences observed in enhancing solubility, the impact of these methods on pharmacokinetic parameters was established. It was found that the production of inclusion complexes and nanostructures leads to the greatest increase in the area under the pharmacokinetic curve by an average of 4.2 and 3.7 times, respectively. The least effect was noted for phytosomes, where this parameter for the modified forms exceeded the initial value by only 1.7 times. Phospholipid complexes exhibited a longer average half-elimination time than all other modifications, achieving a 2.1-fold increase. For nanostructures and micelles, a substantial increase in maximum concentration of the active substance in blood plasma was observed, reaching an average of 5.4 times for both types of modifications. During the systematization and generalization of the data, a high level of heterogeneity in solubility assessment methods across various studies was revealed, complicating comparisons of original data obtained by different researchers. The findings of this review are crucial for researchers investigating the bioavailability of flavonoid compounds and will facilitate the selection of the most effective methods based on the desired outcomes for solubility and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe similarity in appearance of poisonous and medicinal plants, such as Asarum heterotropoides (AH) and Cynanchum paniculatum (CP), poses safety risks due to frequent confusion. Since AH contains toxic ingredients, the traditional methods of olfactory and gustatory identification cannot be used to distinguish AH from CP.MethodsTo differentiate them systematically, we proposed a novel strategy based on dual electronic sensors (DES) and dual fingerprint spectra (DFS). The DES included two intelligent sensors, namely the E-nose and E-tongue, which differentiated AH and CP based on odor and taste, respectively. DFS comprised chemical fingerprint spectra obtained through LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS and electrochemical fingerprint spectra derived from the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, differentiating AH and CP by their specific and overall compositions, respectively. To our knowledge, this was the first time that the E-nose, E-tongue, LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS, and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction were combined to identify AH and CP.Results and discussion With the E-nose, we identified 25 major odor components in AH and 12 odor components in CP in a single run of 140 s. Using the E-tongue, bitterness and astringency were identified as their primary taste differences. Furthermore, 91 compounds in AH and 90 compounds in CP were identified through LC-HR-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Both AH and CP shared nitrogenous compounds, volatile oils, organic acids, and lignans. However, AH uniquely contained coumarins and flavonoids, while CP contained steroidal compounds and saccharides. Notably, AH also possessed distinct toxic components, specifically aristolactam I, aristolochic acid D, and safrole. Based on the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, we obtained the electrochemical fingerprint spectra of AH and CP, thereby facilitating further distinction between these two herbs. Through the combination of electrochemical fingerprint spectra with principal component analysis (PCA) or orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), the accuracy of this method reached 100%. Through the fusion strategy, the odors, tastes, components, and electrochemical properties of AH and CP have been systematically analyzed.",

    "abstract": "TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized on mortar spheres and subsequently packed into a tubular reactor equipped with a concentrical submergible UV lamp for photocatalytic decolorization of aniline blue solution. The microstructure and chemical composition of TiO2 layer on the spheres, the efficiency for aniline decolorization, and the durability of the TiO2 coating were studied. In this work, the mean thickness of the TiO2 layer was 4.01 ± 0.55 µm, while the mean mass loading on the substrate was 5.6 ± 0.61 mg/cm2. Then, the photocatalytic reactor showed excellent performance for dye removal, reaching levels between 95%–97% in 150 min under UV light. Moreover, by radical scavenging experiments, h+, O2.-, and ⋅OH were identified as the main reactive species. Even after twenty consecutive cycles, the removal efficiencies were higher than 83% and the decrease of efficiency was related to the partial detachment of the TiO2 layer (mean thickness decreased to 2.17 µm) which was verified by FESEM-EDX and metallographic microscopy. Finally, based on results, it is worth noting that the effective immobilization of TiO2 photocatalyst on the mortar spheres as substrate facilitates catalyst recovery, improves recyclability, and enables continuous water treatment. Therefore, this technology is a promising option for the removal of dyes in water, we even suggest that the proposed photocatalytic reactor could be scaled up for the treatment of effluents from textile industries, contributing to the abatement of water pollution.",

Specifically, an IC50 value of 19.45 μg/mL against cancer cells and MIC values ranging from 4 μg/mL to 64 μg/mL μg against skin pathogenic strains were observed.

    "abstract": "IntroductionRivaroxaban is an anticoagulant medication that targets a key stage in the blood clotting process, preventing the formation and growth of clots. It is commonly used to prevent thrombosis or inhibit the enlargement of existing clots. Rivaroxaban functions as a Factor Xa inhibitor and is indicated for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as reducing the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, and prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery.MethodsA robust, precise, and selective reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated for analyzing Rivaroxaban in raw materials. Isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was performed using a Thermo ODS Hypersil C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm) at ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of monobasic potassium phosphate at pH 2.9 and acetonitrile in a 70:30 (v/v) ratio, with UV detection at 249 nm.ResultsLinearity was established in the concentration range of 50–1,000 ppm (R2 = 0.999), and the retention time for Rivaroxaban was approximately 12 min. The percentage relative standard deviation (RSD) for precision and accuracy was consistently below 2.0%, ensuring method reliability. Solution stability studies confirmed the stability of Rivaroxaban over the analysis period, as no peak loss, degradation, or additional peaks were observed between the first and last injections. Furthermore, forced degradation studies were conducted under various stress conditions, including acid and base hydrolysis, as well as hydrogen peroxide oxidation. The method successfully resolved Rivaroxaban from its degradation products, demonstrating its stability-indicating capability.ConclusionRivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant that selectively and directly inhibits factor Xa. A method has been developed and validated for its analysis, adhering to guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). The validation process assessed parameters such as specificity, robustness, linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ). The LOD for impurities and degradants was determined to be 0.3 ppm, while the LOQ was 1 ppm. This stability-indicating method is highly suitable for routine quality control and analytical applications in both raw materials and finished drug products, owing to its simplicity, efficiency, and robustness.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) confirmed that FE creates larger pores and an expanded surface area, facilitating more effective compound release. HPLC analysis indicated that FE increased the cinnamaldehyde content from 348.53 to 370.20 μg/g. UPLC-MS analysis further demonstrated that FE is more effective for extracting volatile and phenolic compounds. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of GZ extract on a wind-cold syndrome model was investigated. FE significantly alleviated symptoms and restored lung tissue integrity, through the regulation of the citric acid cycle and thiamine metabolism pathways.

    "abstract": "IntroductionTerpenes are a diverse class of natural metabolites that exhibit a range of biological activities, including antidiabetic, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study was designed to determine the chemical profile and biological activity of Rhododendron luteum leaf (RLL) supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extracts.Materials and methodsThe LC-APCI-MS/MS method was used to determine the composition and content of the triterpenes (including sterols). In turn, LC-ESI-MS/MS was applied for the analysis of polyphenolic compounds. The volatile composition of RLL extracts was analysed using the HS-SPME-GC-FID-MS technique. The inhibitory activity against enzymes such as xanthine oxidase (XO), lipoxygenase (LOX), hyaluronidase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase was assessed using in vitro bioassays.Results and discussionThe LC-MS analyses revealed high levels of oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and β-sitosterol, which belong to terpenes, as well as polyphenols such as syringic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid, along with apigenin and its 7-glucoside. Among volatiles, the most prominent were limonene, eugenol, β-phenylethanol, and β-caryophyllene. In vitro assays showed a high hyaluronidase and moderate lipoxygenase and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity presented by RLL supercritical extracts. Moreover, the samples were found to present α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. This may indicate the anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic potential of RLL supercritical extracts.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWith the growing global concern over CO2 emissions, reducing CO2 output has become an urgent requirement. The iron production industry is among those with the highest CO2 emissions, primarily due to the use of coke as a reductant and the use of a heat source at approximately 2,000°C. To address this issue, various alternative reductants, including CO, H2, and lignite, have been explored. Building on these efforts, we recently reported a novel ironmaking system using oxalic acid (HOOC–COOH) as the reductant. Formate salts, hydrogenated forms of CO2, are promising precursors for oxalate salts; however, their behavior during dimerization remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigate the influence of group 1 and 2 metal cations on the base-promoted dehydrogenative coupling of formate to form oxalate.MethodsFirst, dehydrogenative coupling of sodium formate was executed by using various types of groups 1 and 2 metal carbonates. Second, the base was replaced from metal carbonates to metal hydroxides to check the reactivity. Finally, a countercation of sodium formate was replaced to various types of groups 1 and 2 metals. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, DFT calculation was executed.Results and discussionTreatment of sodium formate with various bases (group 1 and 2 metal carbonates or hydroxides) revealed that group 1 metal hydroxides are more effective than metal carbonates for oxalate formation, with cesium hydroxide (CsOH) exhibiting high reactivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that this kinetic advantage arises not only from increased basicity but also from intermediate destabilization in the Na/Cs mixed-cation system. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that oxalate yield is influenced by the thermodynamic stability of intermediates and products (oxalate salts), highlighting the crucial role of cations in the reaction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the toxicity characteristics and mechanisms of quinacrine acetate, a small molecule modulator of the cGAS-STING-TBK1 signaling pathway, and to establish and validate the application value of network toxicology analysis strategy.MethodsProTox and ADMETlab platforms were used to evaluate the toxic effects of quinacrine acetate on human tissues and organs. Potential targets associated with quinacrine acetate toxicity were identified through ChEMBL, STITCH, GeneCards, OMIM, and TD databases. GO and KEGG analyses were employed to elucidate related functions and molecular mechanisms. STRING and Cytoscape software were utilized to identify key hub genes, while molecular docking validation was performed using the CB-Dock2 database. Based on toxicity analysis results, COPD was selected as a disease model, and GEO database was used to analyze the expression characteristics, immune correlation, and drug target value of hub genes in COPD.ResultsProTox and ADMETlab analyses revealed that quinacrine acetate exhibited significant toxicity to the respiratory system (toxicity level 4, risk coefficient 0.959). Through integrated multi-database analysis, 14 potential targets related to quinacrine acetate-induced respiratory system toxicity were identified. GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that quinacrine acetate-induced respiratory toxicity was primarily mediated through metabolic pathways. Network analysis via STRING and Cytoscape identified AKT1, PLA2G4A, and ALOX5 as three core targets. Molecular docking results confirmed strong binding affinity between quinacrine acetate and these core targets. In COPD patients, PLA2G4A and ALOX5 showed significantly upregulated expression, with hub gene ROC curve AUC value reaching 0.829, demonstrating good diagnostic value. Further immune correlation analysis revealed that ALOX5 and PLA2G4A were closely associated with various immune cell expressions and served as targets for multiple drugs including histamine, melittin, and formic acid.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that quinacrine acetate may influence the progression and risk of respiratory system diseases by regulating metabolic pathways. The findings provide not only a theoretical foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of quinacrine acetate-induced respiratory toxicity but also new perspectives and methodological references for evaluating the toxic effects of small molecule compounds in respiratory diseases. Therefore, we demonstrates the practical application value of network toxicology as an efficient predictive tool for identifying potential toxicity targets and pathways, which can guide subsequent experimental validation and provide mechanistic insights that traditional toxicology approaches might miss.",

Further investigations of this kind can lead to the development of targeted synthesis protocols and tailoring of their structure-related physical properties. In this work, the structural evolution during the synthesis of the luminescent [Tb (bipy)2(NO3)3] (bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine) complex is studied by monitoring the ligand-to-metal energy transfer through in situ luminescence measurements combined with synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. These experiments reveal an interesting crystallization pathway involving the formation of a reaction intermediate that is dependent on parameters such as ligand-to-metal molar ratios. In addition, the structure of [Tb (bipy)2(NO3)3] is solved from serial crystallography data collected at a microfocused synchrotron X-ray beamline. This is an emerging technique that can be used to interrogate individual crystallites and overcome beam damage effects. The resulting structure is found to correspond to that determined by classical single crystal XRD, and a perspective on realizing future in situ measurements of this type is given. This work therefore describes multiple advancements combining crystallite-specific diffraction probes and in situ techniques to track the synthesis kinetics of luminescent materials.",

In this study, we report the biosynthesis of TiO2NPs using Morus alba leaf extract and their subsequent incorporation into a gellan gum (GG) biopolymer to create a hydrogel. The physicochemical properties of the biosynthesized TiO2NPs and the TiO2NP@GG hydrogel were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the bioactivity of the materials was investigated through antibacterial assays against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, as well as in vitro wound healing studies using a 3T3 fibroblast scratch assay. XRD analysis confirmed the successful formation of anatase phase TiO2. SEM images revealed the presence of irregular and rod-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles, with EDS analysis confirming their composition of oxygen and titanium. The particle size was determined to be 80–90 nm, and the nanoparticles exhibited homogeneous distribution throughout the gellan gum biopolymer network. The TiO2NP@GG hydrogel displayed significant antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli. In vitro wound healing studies using a scratch assay on 3T3 fibroblast cells seeded onto the hydrogel demonstrated a high cell survival rate and enhanced cell migration, suggesting potential for biomedical applications as a wound dressing material.",

The structural characterization, confirmed through XRD, SEM, FT-IR, and BET analyses, validated the formation of the MCM-41 framework with well-defined mesoporous properties and a high surface area of 159.6 m2/g. The developed Ca-MCM-41 was evaluated as a potential adsorbent for the removal of Sr2+ and B3+ ions from both aqueous solutions and real seawater samples collected from the Gulf of Suez, Egypt. The adsorption capacity at saturation reached 285.9 mg/g for Sr2+ and 86.1 mg/g for B3+, demonstrating the framework’s high affinity for these contaminants. The adsorption mechanisms were elucidated using steric and energetic parameters, as derived from statistical physics-based isotherm models. The Ca-MCM-41 framework exhibited a higher active site density (148.9 mg/g) for Sr2+ compared to B3+ (54.8 mg/g), explaining its superior sequestration performance for strontium ions. Each receptor site was capable of accommodating up to three Sr2+ ions and 2 B3+ ions, indicating a multi-ionic interaction process and preferential vertical alignment during adsorption. Energetic analysis revealed that the sequestration process occurred via physical adsorption with interaction energies below 7 kJ/mol, alongside exothermic and spontaneous behavior, as evidenced by calculated internal energy, entropy, and enthalpy values. The developed Ca-MCM-41 structure demonstrated notable efficiency in real seawater applications, achieving sequestration percentages of 80% for Sr2+ and 64% for B3+, considering their average concentrations (24.2 mg/L for Sr2+ and 12.85 mg/L for B3+) in a 1-L volume.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. The oncoprotein MDM2 negatively regulates the tumor suppressor p53, and its overexpression in BC promotes tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents a promising therapeutic approach. However, many existing MDM2 inhibitors suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and off-target toxicity, necessitating the discovery of novel, more selective alternatives. This study aims to identify natural terpenoid compounds with potent MDM2 inhibitory potential through computational approaches.MethodsA library of 398 natural terpenoids was sourced from the NPACT database and filtered based on Lipinski’s Rule of Five. A two-stage docking strategy was applied: 1) rigid protein-flexible ligand docking to screen for high-affinity binders, followed by 2) ensemble docking using multiple MDM2 conformations derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The top candidates were further evaluated for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles using ADMET analysis. Finally, 150 ns MD simulations and binding free energy (MM-PBSA) calculations were performed to assess the stability and strength of protein-ligand interactions.ResultsThree terpenoid compounds, olean-12-en-3-beta-ol, cabralealactone, and 27-deoxyactein demonstrated strong binding affinities toward MDM2 in ensemble docking studies. ADMET analysis confirmed their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Further MD simulations indicated that these compounds formed highly stable complexes with MDM2. Notably, 27-deoxyactein exhibited the lowest binding free energy (−154.514 kJ/mol), outperforming the reference inhibitor Nutlin-3a (−133.531 kJ/mol), suggesting superior binding stability and interaction strength.ConclusionOur findings highlight 27-deoxyactein as a promising MDM2 inhibitor with strong binding affinity, stability, and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. This study provides a computational foundation for further experimental validation, supporting the potential of terpenoid-based MDM2 inhibitors in BC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Doping-associated surface modification is a powerful strategy to enhance the photocatalytic potential of n-type semiconductor nanomaterials. Silver (Ag) is one of the most effective dopants that can result in the retardation of the electron hole recombination-generating Schottky barrier at the TiO2 interface with a simultaneous extension of absorption to the visible region. This work presents a study on the effect of catechin, a bioactive principle polyphenol compound found in various plants, on the synthesis, Ag-doping and stabilization of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NPs). The nanoparticles were irregular in shape with sizes ranging from 19 to 30 nm. Ag-TiO2NPs were fabricated using TiO2 as a precursor and 1%, 3%, and 5% AgNO3 as a doping agent. The average particle size of 1%Ag-TiO2NPs, 3%Ag-TiO2NPs, and 5%Ag-TiO2NPs was 27.3 ± 7.5 nm, 29.8 ± 9.6 nm, and 25.0 ± 9.0 nm, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm corresponding to the Ag (111) plane in addition to the presence of the anatase phase of TiO2. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibited a broad peak around 400–800 cm−1 that was attributed to Ti-O-Ti stretching vibrations which was slightly shifted in Ag-TiO2NPs due to changes in the local bonding environment around Ti atoms caused by interactions with Ag. Catechin loading in the TiO2NPs and Ag-TiO2NPs was between 1.55 and 3.3 wt. %. TiO2NPs, 1%Ag-TiO2NPs, 3%Ag-TiO2NPs, and 5%Ag-TiO2NPs exhibited superior photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye up to 78%, 87%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, and RhB dye up to 92%, 94%, 97% and 99%, respectively, with a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, its recyclability was also demonstrated for three cycles. The simplicity of fabrication and superior photocatalytic performance of TiO2 demonstrated here make this green route advantageous for environmental applications to treat dye contaminated effluent as well as for numerous other applications.",

The sucessful development of EXTC particles was followed based on different techniques and applied in effective sequestration of PO43- and NO3− ions from water. The EXTC product as adsorbent demonstrates remarkable effectiveness for both PO43- (257.9 mg/g) and NO3− (164.2 mg/g) as compared to several studied structures. Depending on the steric analysis of Monolayer equilibrium model, the interface of EXTC highly saturated with interactive receptors for the both ions but with higher abundant for PO43- (151.5 mg/g) as compared to NO3− (61.5 mg/g). This resulted in higher aggregation effect during the uptake of NO3− (4 ions per site) than PO43- (3 ions per site) which also donate the vertical orientation of these adsorbed ions and operation of multi-ionic sequestration mechanisms. The structure is highly recyclable and of significant safety and cane be applied in its spent or exhausted state as fertilizer. The energetic evaluation considering the Gaussian energy (&lt;8.5 kJ/mol) as well as the sequestration energy (&lt;4 kJ/mol), suggested the predominant impact of physical mechanisms (hydrogen bonds and electrostatic attraction), in addition to the impact of the weak chemical complexation. Furthermore, the thermodynamic functions declare the retention of these ions into the framework of EXTC by exothermic and spontaneous reactions.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionTriclosan is a common antibacterial drug identified as a major contaminant in South African waters, notably in Gauteng and KwaZulu Natal provinces. This contaminant comes from personal care products and pharmaceuticals. It has been frequently detected in local streams and wastewater treatment plants, posing a threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Studies have emphasised the necessity of addressing the presence of triclosan in water bodies to lessen its harmful impacts on the environment.MethodsIn this study, NaAlg/MnSx bio-nanocomposite hydrogel beads incorporated with different amounts of MnS NPs (0.02–0.2 g) were synthesised via the ionic gelation method and employed as an adsorbent for the removal of triclosan from aqueous solutions. The surface charge, morphology, thermal stability, crystallinity, and functional groups of NaAlg/MnS bio-nanocomposite hydrogel beads were characterised by SEM equipped with EDX, TEM, Thermogravimetric analysis, FTIR, XRD, and zeta sizer (mV).Results and discussionsThe experimental results demonstrated that incorporating 0.02–0.2 g of MnS NPs in the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels led to enhanced mechanical structure, porosity, and swelling ability for the adsorption of triclosan compared to pristine NaAlg hydrogel. The response surface methodology was used to optimise the experimental parameters affecting the batch adsorption of triclosan onto the surface of the adsorbent. Basic pH conditions were suitable for removing triclosan in aqueous solutions via hydrogen bonding with the carboxyl functional groups of the bio-nanocomposite beads. The pseudo-second order, Freundlich, and Sips models better explained the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm data. The maximum adsorption capacity estimated using the Langmuir isotherm model was 132 mg/g. The thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S)) were found to be 44.042 kJ/mol and 207.018 J/Kmol, respectively, which means the reaction is endothermic and increases randomisation at the solid/liquid interface. The Gibbs free energy (∆G) was negative throughout the studied temperature range, indicating that the adsorption process was spontaneously and energetically favoured.",

However, reports of thermally stable dielectric switching behavior in molecularly tailored 2D lead‐free copper chloride perovskites are limited. In this work, we employed monofluoride substitution to successfully regulate the crystal symmetry to achieve high‐temperature structural phase transition and switchable dielectric responses in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 (2‐FEA = 2‐fluoroethylaminium). Fluorine substitution establishes intermolecular C─H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions among the organic cations, driving a symmetry‐breaking transition from the parent tetragonal (EA)2CuCl4 (EA = ethylaminium) to a monoclinic phase in (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 but it maintains a 2D perovskite structure. Consequently, (2‐FEA)2CuCl4 undergoes an evident order‐disorder structural transition (P21/c‐Cmce) around 351 K accompanied by dielectric switching behavior. Besides, eye‐catching thermochromic behavior has been evidenced by variable‐temperature UV–vis spectra revealing a temperature‐dependent bandgap redshift. This finding establishes fluoride substitution as a powerful strategy for the molecular engineering of multifunctional materials while providing valuable insights for the rational design of stimuli‐responsive hybrid systems.",

Consequently, the development of a selective and straightforward method for detecting CatS is crucial. In this study, we introduce a colorimetric approach utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and CatS‐specific peptides for the detection of CatS activity. The CatS enzyme cleavage peptides, PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2, can stabilize AuNPs in a hydrosaline solution without aggregation. Upon hydrolysis of PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 by CatS, the AuNPs aggregate with a color change from red to blue. After optimizing the size of the AuNPs and the concentration of the peptides, the limits of detection for CatS were both to be 10 nM, when PMGAPC or PMGAPC‐NH2 were used to protect the AuNPs. Therefore, this colorimetric assay, which employs peptides and AuNPs, enables not only a selective but also a simple detection of CatS, visible to the naked eye.",

Because of this, they are suitable for incorporation in mobile devices, which often prioritize their portability and lightweight design. Therefore, important aspects of this review study have been emphasized, including, the LIBs eco‐innovative advancements, environmental implications, life cycle evaluation, recycling, and potential future research to mitigate these impacts.

X‐ray crystallography reveals a slightly distorted extended kekulene backbone, while peripheral aryl substituents effectively suppress intermolecular π–π stacking.

Most conventional inhibitors are target‐specific and ineffective against broad‐spectrum viral infections. Therefore, the current scenario demands developing inhibitors to attenuate the membrane properties instead of targeting the viral proteins. In the present work, we have designed a new WD‐containing peptide (dmTG‐23) by introducing a WD repeat at the center of the peptide sequence using mTG‐23 peptide as a template and a 14‐amino acid peptide with seven WD repeats (WD‐14), and tested their efficacies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐induced fusion assay. Our findings show that both dmTG‐23 and WD‐14 prevent PEG‐induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol concentrations, with a higher effect for dmTG‐23. Moreover, we have compared our results with our previous observations on TG‐23 and mTG‐23 to evaluate the importance of the number and position of WD repeats in the peptide sequence to impart the highest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that three WD repeat‐containing dmTG‐23 shows the highest efficacy against the PEG‐induced fusion of SUVs by enhancing the membrane order at the acyl chain region. This result is significantly important in designing peptide‐based broad‐spectrum fusion inhibitors.",

It was shown that a larger strong Brønsted acidity enhanced the total aromatics formation with an increased light arenes content (especially at elevated WHSV). At low WHSV, excess Brønsted acidity leads to the declined aromatics yield due to its high cracking ability. On the contrary, a higher Lewis acidity and extensive mesoporosity promoted the heavier aromatics production accelerating the coke formation and shortening the catalyst lifetime. An improved aromatization performance and a prolonged durability of the zeolite catalyst were controlled by a balanced Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio and the ratio of WHSV to acid site concentration.",

In a recent study, Wang and colleagues introduced an innovative “in‐situ salt flux” copolymerization technique to synthesize poly(triazine imide) (PTI) with high crystallinity and minimal defects. This approach resulted in a record apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 37.8% at 380 nm. This strategy effectively balances the impact of two types of vacancies (carbon and nitrogen) on OWS performance and establishes clear structure‐property‐activity relationships for the photocatalytic OWS process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo elucidate the emergence and amplification of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral molecules and their assemblies, we designed positionally isomeric chiral V‐shaped Schiff base ligands and their corresponding bis(boron difluoride) complexes. The ligands were synthesized by condensing chiral cyclohexanediamine with either 1‐hydroxy‐2‐naphthaldehyde or 2‐hydroxy‐1‐naphthaldehyde, followed by complexation with boron difluoride (BF2) to yield CNB1 and CNB2, respectively. While the parent Schiff bases exhibited no CPL, BF2 coordination induced strong CPL signals in solution. Remarkably, upon aggregation in a mixed solvent system, CNB2 displayed enhanced and inverted CPL, whereas its isomer CNB1 showed attenuated emission. Through comprehensive characterization and singlecrystal analysis, we attribute this divergent behavior to distinct molecular packing modes: CNB2 forms tightly stacked aggregates with efficient π─π interactions, while CNB1 adopts a less ordered arrangement. This study establishes a clear correlation between subtle structural modifications, supramolecular packing, and CPL performance, offering a rational strategy for tailoring chiroptical properties through precise molecular design and controlled self‐assembly.",

The solvent‐free activated form of 1, labeled as 1′ catalyzes both Biginelli and Hantzsch reactions under mild conditions. The Biginelli reaction using aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea proceeded at 80 °C in 0.5 h with a 99% yield, while the Hantzsch reaction with aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and ammonium acetate occurred at room temperature in ethanol within 1 h, also achieving a 99% yield. Compound 1′ showed broad substrate compatibility in both reactions. Additionally, the MOF exhibited excellent sensing ability for the anticancer drug raloxifene (RLX), showing a fast turn‐off fluorescence response (within 5 s), a low detection limit (9 nM), and a high Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv, 2 × 106 M⁻¹), enabling sensitive detection in diverse environments, including wastewater and biofluids. Detailed investigations into catalytic mechanisms and detection capabilities provide valuable insights for advancing drug synthesis and analytical methodologies.

In this work, cellulose is derivatized with a thiol‐containing amino acid, cysteine, via two approaches to enhance silver anchoring by exploiting the high affinity between thiol groups and soft metals. The first method involves direct esterification to produce Cel‐Cys‐Est, while the second uses periodate oxidation to form dialdehyde cellulose (DAC), followed by linking with cysteine via a Schiff base reaction, creating DAC‐Cys. After confirming the successful cysteine derivatization using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the adsorption characteristics towards silver ions have been optimized for parameters like pH, adsorbent dosage, and ion concentration. The kinetic studies have shown the pseudo‐second‐order model for silver ion adsorption over both materials, while the isotherm studies have indicated Langmuir‐type monolayer adsorption. The silver‐loaded DAC‐Cys, having higher adsorption capacity, has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work highlights the versatility of cysteine‐derivatized cellulose as an effective, eco‐friendly material for silver ion sequestration and its promising application in antimicrobial domains.",

To address this, here we report the synthesis of cysteine‐capped copper nanoclusters (Cys‐Cu NCs) in just 30 min under ambient aqueous conditions. The incorporation of γ‐cyclodextrin (γ‐CD) enhanced the stability and immediately amplified the photoluminescence of the nanoclusters by triggering aggregation‐induced emission (AIE), increasing their quantum yield from 0.15 to 0.24. The remarkable photoluminescence of γ‐CD‐assisted Cys‐Cu NCs (γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs) was selectively quenched by protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), enabling ultrasensitive detection with an exceptionally low limit of 70 pM. Stern–Volmer analysis revealed the underlying interaction mechanisms between γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs and PPIX. This precise detection of PPIX is critical for diagnosing and monitoring porphyrias and other heme‐related disorders. The method demonstrated excellent PPIX recovery in complex biological matrices, such as human serum and artificial urine, across a broad PPIX concentration range (0.5–10 µM), highlighting its applicability in real‐world systems. Additionally, the nanoclusters exhibited strong sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS), underscoring their potential for oxidative stress monitoring. These findings position γ‐CD‐Cys‐Cu NCs as a versatile, cost‐effective, diagnostic tool for clinical and biomedical applications.",

Aryloxyacetals have been utilized as chiral aldehyde equivalents in the total synthesis of biologically significant natural products. However, achieving high enantiocontrol in the synthesis of aryloxyphthalides remains a significant challenge due to side reactions and racemic product formation. Herein, we report a novel N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC)‐catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of aryloxyphthalides from phthalaldehyde and phenols. Our methodology demonstrates broad substrate scope, providing up to 98% enantioselectivity with excellent yields. This strategy offers a practical solution for the enantioselective synthesis of aryloxyphthalides, expanding the utility of chiral acetals in asymmetric synthesis. The development of optically pure aryloxyphthalides may further benefit the synthesis of complex natural products containing phthalide moieties.",

In this review paper, we trace the evolution of phosphate‐based porous materials, starting with early breakthroughs in their synthesis, and provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the understanding and application of transition metal phosphate‐based mesoporous materials, with a particular emphasis on their roles in sustainable chemical processes. By integrating foundational research with recent advancements, this review aims to provide a deeper insight into key challenges. These challenges include limited cooperation between fundamental research and industry, likely due to scalability issues, and the design of green and sustainable synthesis routes.

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen has been deemed as the ideal energy source and carrier due to its unmatched energy efficiency and sustainability. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need to develop cost‐effective materials to replace costly Pt in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the electrocatalysts with low overpotential and robust stability under various conditions is a particularly significant concern. In this study, a straightforward and effective approach was proposed for the precise synthesis of RuP2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N, P, S‐tridoped carbon, which involves utilizing zinc pyrithione, phytic acid and Ru salt as starting materials. The effect of different Ru loadings on the morphology and structures of the composite catalysts was examined carefully. The obtained composites exhibit superior alkaline activity surpassing commercial Pt/C and comparable acidic and neutral activity as well as excellent pH‐wide stability. DFT computations reveal the integration of RuP2 with tridoped carbon can tailor the electronic structure of Ru active sites by interfacial electron transfer, thus optimizing the adsorption energy and promoting the HER activity. The benign graphitization of doped carbon and porous structures ensure the smooth charge and mass transfer during HER process. The cost‐effective and straightforward synthesis methods presented in this work offer a promising alternative to commercial Pt/C for practical hydrogen‐related applications.",

In comparison with a series of POSS ILs and ion pairs, we investigated the effects of the POSS core on the microenvironment around dyes in ILs by evaluating normalized polarity and Kamlet–Taft parameters with several types of solvatochromic dyes as probes. Consequently, it was revealed that POSS ILs should have low polarity where POSS could play a critical role in enhancing intermolecular interactions from the directly‐connected anion to other species including cations and dyes. In terms of applications, it was found that low‐polarity POSS ILs have high compatibility with conventional conjugated polymers, which can be used for fabricating highly‐efficient luminescent ionic‐liquid hybrid films owing to the isolation of each polymer chain by POSS even under ionic environments.",

Regioselective ring‐opening cyclization of cyclohexane‐1,3‐dione‐2‐spirocyclopropanes using sodium hydrosulfide as a sulfur‐transfer reagent proceeded smoothly and subsequent addition of an acid afforded the corresponding tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen‐4‐one derivatives in good to excellent yields. Cycloheptane‐1,3‐dione‐2‐spirocyclopropanes could be also applied to the present protocol. In contrast, the reaction of monocyclic 1,1‐diacetyl‐2‐phenylcyclopropane with sodium hydrosulfide and subsequent addition of an acid gave decomposition products instead of the desired product. This result suggests that the spiro structure is crucial for successful ring‐opening cyclization. One of the products obtained from cyclohexane‐1,3‐dione‐2‐spirocyclopropanes could be converted into the 2‐substituted 4‐hydroxybenzo[b]thiophene derivative while avoiding oxidation of the sulfide to sulfoxide or sulfone. This protocol provides an alternative synthetic method to access benzo[b]thiophenes without using multisubstituted benzenes as starting materials, which are often difficult to prepare. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from cyclopropanes.",

Real‐time monitoring of extracellular Ca2⁺ concentrations ([Ca2+]e) can provide valuable quantitative insights into programmed cell death, which may greatly benefit cancer therapy and other biological applications. This study used a modified ion‐sensitive field‐effect transistor (ISFET) as a platform for Ca2⁺ sensing. The ISFET device was functionalized with a Ca2⁺‐selective membrane containing polyurethane (PU) and calcium ionophore II. The Ca2⁺‐FET device exhibited a sensitivity of 35 ± 3 mV/pCa (pCa 0–5) toward Ca2⁺ with insignificant cross‐sensitivity to other ions, such as sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺). The device was applied to monitor [Ca2+]e concentrations in the MDA‐MB‐231 breast cancer cell culture, showing sufficient reliance in detecting Ca2⁺ concentrations (0.1 mM to 1 M (pCa 0–5)) correlated with cellular activities. This technique offers a noninvasive and label‐free approach for real‐time Ca2⁺ monitoring in cell culture, with potential applications in cancer research and therapeutic development.",

Drastic change is noted in the physico–chemical features of CNDs achieved using sulphuric acid and water through solvothermal route. A red shift in emission is noted in system achieved using sulfuric acid medium. The synthesized CNDs are explored for light emitting diode (LED) application. CNDs achieved using hydrothermal method (MCDs) lead to pure white light (CIE coordinates: 0.33, 0.38) emitting LEDs, and sulfuric acid modification (SMCD) produces LEDs emitting in yellowish‐orange light (CIE coordinates: 0.57, 0.42), due to enhanced oxidation of carbon core. Further, the difference in solvents is also reflected in the response of these CNDS toward external analytes. Picric acid induced luminescence quenching of SMCDs enabled selective detection of the analyte among 11 nitroaromatic compounds, highlighting the impact of surface functionalization in tuning the response toward external environments. The sensing mechanism, involving the inner filter effect and static quenching, as well as the selective response to picric acid, was confirmed through optical characterization and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis.",

Photophysical studies of the push‐pull fluorophores 8a and 8b revealed a positive solvatochromic effect with Δμ > 15D and Stokes shifts of up to 270 nm. Experimental data and theoretical calculations of the ground and excited states of the compounds demonstrated that pyridoindoles 4a‐e and 7a,b exhibit a planarized intramolecular charge‐transfer (PLICT) state, which is accompanied by a gradual increase in luminescence quantum yield for samples 4d and 7b with increasing solvent polarity. Probe 4b, characterized by an acid dissociation constant (pKa) of 5.5, showed high sensitivity to local pH changes in the microenvironment. A “turn‐off” acidochromic response was observed for 4d and 8a with Stern–Volmer quenching constants of 1.6 × 103 and 5.5 × 103 M−1, respectively, while a “turn‐off‐on” response was detected for 4b and 8b during titration with TFA. Fluorescence and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy studies of the interaction between probe 4b and calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) confirmed a static quenching mechanism with the formation of 4b‐ctDNA complex, indicating that the probe binds to the DNA helix via a groove binding mode.

A single regioisomeric thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole staple was formed, generating the thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole‐bridged peptide. The stapling reaction can be carried out in various solvents. Moreover, the obtained nonsymmetric cyclic peptides were stable in PBS solution. Furthermore, three bicyclic peptides containing both an acetone‐like bridge and the thieno[2,3‐c]pyrrole bridge were synthesized via two stapling strategies: (1) a symmetric stapling reaction of 1,3‐dichloroacetone (DCA) with two Cys residues, and (2) a nonsymmetric stapling reaction of ATA with Lys and Cys residues. Satisfied yields of the bicyclic peptides were achieved. The positions of the two bridges determined the synthetic accessiblity of the bicyclic peptides.

However, examples of such NHC ligand platforms are limited. Dinuclear palladium(II) complexes comprising bis‐imidazolylidene along with pyridine or tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) as ancillary ligands were synthesized and characterized by using standard spectroscopic techniques. The dinuclear bis‐NHC complex with PCy3 as an ancillary ligand appeared to be a highly active precatalyst for the intermolecular α‐arylation of 1‐methyl‐2‐oxindole and this complex appeared to be beneficial over its corresponding mononuclear complex in terms of catalytic outcomes which is possibly due to the cooperative action between two palladium(II) centers during catalysis. The DLS measurements were performed which indicates the homogeneous nature of the aforementioned catalysis.",

The optimal doping concentration was found to be 0.5 wt% Nd3⁺, where luminescence intensity decreases with higher concentrations due to concentration quenching. Thermal annealing significantly enhances both the crystallinity and luminescence intensity of the NCs, with the most notable improvements observed up to 500 °C. However, heating beyond 650 °C induces a phase transition from Na₂Ti₆O₁₃ to TiO₂, which impacts the NCs' structural and luminescent properties. Thermal sensing performance was evaluated using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) between emissions at 1060 nm and 1340 nm across a temperature range of 300–343K, revealing the highest relative thermal sensitivity (Sr) of 3.28% K⁻¹ in the sample annealed at 250 °C. For applications requiring high emission intensity, the 0.5 wt% Nd3⁺‐doped Na₂Ti₆O₁₃ NCs annealed at 800 °C exhibited the highest figure of merit, combining high luminescence intensity at 1060 nm with excellent Sr, making them ideal for nanothermometry. Notably, the excitation (808 nm) and emission wavelengths (900, 1060, and 1340 nm) fall within the biological tissue windows, suggesting significant potential for biological nanothermometry applications. This study underscores the critical role of optimizing both doping concentration and thermal annealing conditions to enhance the properties of NCs, offering new insights into their use for advanced thermal sensing applications in biological and medical fields.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDesign and synthesis of the fluorophores with tailored emission is critical for advanced optoelectronic applications, including white LEDs. Here in this study, we synthesized benzo[d]thiazole‐based donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) systems to achieve efficient fluorophores with tunable‐emission properties. Three luminogens (based on triphenylamine, diphenylamine, and carbazole as donor units and benzo[d]thiazole as acceptor units) were designed, synthesized, and explored as phosphors for white LEDs. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction revealed significant twisting in the molecular geometries. These twisted structures effectively reduced conjugation, which resulted in a greenish‐blue emission in nonpolar solvents. The photophysical properties of these compounds were investigated through solvatochromism experiments and Lippert–Mataga plots, and the study reveals that the compounds have a hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) character in their excited states. Lifetime studies revealed mono‐ and bi‐exponential decay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to optimize the geometries, and a close match between the theoretical and single‐crystal structures was observed. Further, the selected luminogens were integrated with a red‐emitting Eu(III) phosphor and PMMA matrix to fabricate a white light‐emitting diode (LED). The white LED device exhibited a color rendering index (CRI = 74), excellent chromaticity coordinates (x = 0.29, y = 0.30), a correlated color temperature (CCT = 7207 K), and a luminous efficacy of radiation (LER = 320 lm/W). We observed that introducing an additional diphenylamine donor in the D–A–D system (Py‐28–2) enhanced the absolute PLQY to 46.33%. These results demonstrate the potential of these donor‐acceptor systems for applications in opto‐electronics and lighting technologies.",

However, challenges such as high catalyst costs and low yields persist. This study proposes a two‐step strategy, involving pre‐hydrogenation followed by HDO, to convert the C15 condensation product derived from furfural and levulinic acid into hydrocarbons within the aviation fuel range. A Ni‐based catalyst supported on zirconium phosphate (ZrP) with the incorporation of Nb2O5 was synthesized. At 340 °C, 4 MPa H2, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 14.9, using Ni‐Nb2O5/ZrP as the catalyst for HDO, considering the pre‐hydrogenation, the overall yield of alkanes in the C10–C15 jet fuel range from solid condensation products FLF is 62.4%, with a yield of C15 alkanes of 16.2% and C14 alkanes of 25.2%. A series of characterizations and comparative experiments were carried out. Experimental studies have demonstrated that doping with Nb2O5 plays a crucial role in enhancing the HDO performance. The characterization results indicate that the introduction of an appropriate amount of Nb2O5 increased the electron density of ZrP, enriched the catalyst's acidic sites, in addition, the ratio of Bronsted acid to Lewis acid sites in the catalyst increases. Finally, a brief analysis of industrialization potential was conducted.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRadical cyclizations are powerful tools for complexity building, providing facile access to functionalized cyclic adducts. However, forging two contiguous tetrasubstituted carbons via radical cyclization through the addition of tertiary radicals to geminally disubstituted sp2 carbons has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of double‐bond geometry at the geminally disubstituted sp2 carbon on reactivity and stereochemical outcomes remains underexplored. In this study, we present experimental and computational studies on the carbooxygenation of 2‐fluoro‐3‐aryl‐allyl nitroacetates to investigate reactivity and selectivity differences between (E)‐ and (Z)‐isomers. First, we identify that (E)‐isomers are less reactive than (Z)‐isomers. Second, both (E)‐ and (Z)‐isomers undergo conversion to α,α,β,β‐tetrasubstituted γ‐lactones with high syn‐selectivity, despite the absence of putative E/Z isomerization of the alkene unit. Third, incorporating an electron‐donating group at the radical acceptor enhances the reactivity of (E)‐isomers in catalytic aerobic carbooxygenation. Fourth, computational studies show that syn‐selectivity is mainly governed by the fluorine‐induced gauche effect, whereas SOMO–HOMO level inversion induced by the electron‐donating group at the radical acceptor enhances (E)‐isomer reactivity. Based on these mechanistic insights, we develop a diastereoconvergent protocol using the E/Z mixture as a starting material to synthesize a potent antifungal agent.",

Recent advancements, particularly in the fourth generation of OLEDs, have introduced groundbreaking innovations such as hyperfluorescence and multiresonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MRTADF) emitters. Carbazole has emerged as a versatile scaffold, playing a pivotal role in conventional fluorescence, TADF, roomtemperature phosphorescence (RTP), and MRTADF systems. In recent years, fused carbazole derivatives have gained significant attention as both emitting and host materials in OLEDs. The fusion of carbazole units enhances molecular rigidity and extends the πconjugation, enabling precise tuning of optoelectronic properties across a wide color gamut, including blue, green, orange, yellow, and red emissions. This review systematically explores the application of various fused carbazole systems such as indolocarbazole, thienocarbazole, furocarbazole, indenocarbazole, triazatruxene, acridinecarbazole, chromenocarbazole, pyrenocarbazole, helicene carbazole, and carbazolefused boron/carbonyl MRTADF emitters in OLEDs. The discussion is organized into three sections based on their application in blue, green, and red OLEDs, providing a comprehensive understanding of structure–property relationships. Additionally, other color‐emitting OLEDs are discussed where relevant, offering a holistic perspective on the potential of fused carbazole derivatives in next‐generation OLED technologies.",

Using pulsed laser spectroscopy, we have measured three 2\n            S\n            -2\n            P\n            transitions in the muonic helium-3 (μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            ) ion, an ion formed by a negative muon and bare helium-3 nucleus. This allowed us to extract the Lamb shift, the 2\n            P\n            fine structure splitting, and the 2\n            S\n            -hyperfine splitting in μ\n            3\n            He\n            +\n            .

We show that the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a central 53BP1 axis component, suppresses DNA end resection by EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex but acts by distinct mechanisms in restricting these entities. Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis.",

However, central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic. A lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. Here, we silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.",

Extending the same concept to molecular separation of organic solvents would be a key enabler for the decarbonization of the chemical and petrochemical industries through energy-efficient crude or biocrude oil fractionation. Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts. These membranes, which feature fast and selective transport of hydrocarbons, including multicomponent and industrially relevant mixtures, outperform commercial and state-of-the-art benchmark membranes.",

Since 1975, the intent of this international treaty has been to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. Global commitment to these objectives is reflected by the treaty’s total membership of 188 states. However, member states have thus far been unable to raise strong barriers against illicit bioweapons development. With rapid advancements in science and technology and the rise of biological weapons disinformation, improvements of the Convention are urgently needed. One way to reinforce the treaty is to consider an inspection mechanism that aims to disrupt illicit programs rather than detect them.",

We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.",

In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.",

Using genetic sequences along three ocean transects, we compiled 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds and estimated their degree of optimization for rapid growth (copiotrophy). Data and model consistency indicated that gradients in grazing and substrate lability predominantly set biogeographical patterns, and we identified deep-ocean “slow copiotrophs” whose ecological interactions control the surface accumulation of dissolved organic carbon.",

    "abstract": "How does emigration of highly educated citizens of low-income countries to high-income countries affect the economies of the origin countries? The direct effect is “brain drain”—a decrease in the country’s human capital stock. However, there may also be indirect “brain gain” effects. This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration. We discuss conditions under which beneﬁts from skilled migration may outweigh costs and also describe potential research paths to inform policy.",

Several of these giants have vanished within the past 130,000 years, but the timing and macroevolutionary drivers behind this pattern of rise and collapse remain unclear for some megaherbivore lineages. Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.",

This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.",

TC IV were almost exclusively present within mesenteric lymph nodes suggesting that the presence of TC IV underlies the phenomenon of oral tolerance. A wave of TC IV differentiation in the peri-weaning period was associated with a window of opportunity for enhanced pTreg generation in response to food antigens. Our findings indicate that TC IV may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of food-associated allergic and inflammatory diseases.",

In this study, our analysis of 8800 records of historical and modern elevational range limits for 440 animal and 1629 plant species revealed little evidence supporting the proposed threats. Observed changes largely fell within random expectations, accounting for geometric constraints. Although delayed mountaintop extinctions point to accumulating extinction debt, concurrent range expansions of both narrow-range and lowland species suggest thermal niche underfilling, processes that collectively drive biotic homogenization across biologically complex mountain ecosystems.",

We find that Late Pleistocene horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times during the last glacial interval. We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth. Our combined Western and Indigenous framework offers critical guidance for wildlife conservation amid ongoing climate change.",

Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM, and heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development.

Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is completely independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.",

These bnAb precursors, that target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design.",

Specifically, how astrocytes respond to different neurotransmitters in vivo and how they affect downstream circuit modulation are questions that remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we report a mechanism in\n            Drosophila\n            by which G protein–coupled adrenergic signaling in astrocytes can control—or “gate”—their ability to respond to other neurotransmitters. Further, we show that manipulating this pathway potently regulates neuronal circuit activity and animal behavior. This gating mechanism is conserved in cultured primary mammalian astrocytes, suggesting that it might be an ancient feature of astrocyte circuit function. Our work establishes a mechanism by which astrocytes dynamically respond to and modulate neuronal activity in different brain regions and in different behavioral states.",

During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.",

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cannot synthesize ATP but must import cytoplasmic ATP to energize protein folding, quality control and trafficking2,3. It was recently proposed that a member of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, termed SLC35B1 (also known as AXER), is not a nucleotide sugar transporter but a long-sought-after ER importer of ATP4. Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3–5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine1,2, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi3-5. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth3, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate6-8 have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures9,10. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius11-13 feature large dentine tubules1 that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth14-16. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth16. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues.",

Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles. The compound classes obtained through these methods—indazoles3,4, benzisoxazoles5, benzimidazoles6,7 and benzoxazoles8—are biologically relevant moieties found as substructures in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The procedures introduced substantially enlarge the methods portfolio in the emerging field of skeletal editing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The decline in malaria deaths has recently stalled owing to several factors, including the widespread resistance of Anopheles vectors to the insecticides used in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)1,2. One way to mitigate insecticide resistance is to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage of development by incorporating antiparasitic compounds into LLINs. This strategy can prevent onward parasite transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy3,4. Here, we performed an in vivo screen of compounds against the mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development. Of the 81 compounds tested, which spanned 28 distinct modes of action, 22 were active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen, which in turn prevented establishment of infection. Medicinal chemistry was then used to improve antiparasitic activity of the top hits from the screen. We generated several endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) that inhibited the P. falciparum cytochrome bc\n            1 complex (CytB). Two lead compounds that targeted separate sites in CytB (Qo and Qi) showed potent, long-lasting and stable activity when incorporated and/or extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films. ELQ activity was fully preserved in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and parasites resistant to these compounds had impaired development at the mosquito stage. These data demonstrate the promise of incorporating ELQ compounds into LLINs to counteract insecticide resistance and to reduce malaria transmission.",

While phosphate was likely the main phosphorus source for life during the Archean, phosphite (HPO3\n            2\n            −) gained importance leading up to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, the concentration of phosphite in seawater at that time, and the processes driving this shift in P utilization, remain poorly constrained. Using lab experiments and phosphite data from banded iron formations (BIFs), we show that hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) preferentially remove phosphate over phosphite. This suggests that shallow seawater at the onset of the GOE could have contained up to 0.17 µM phosphite, comprising 5–88% of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus. We propose that phosphate depletion driven by HFO adsorption and microbial competition may have promoted the use of phosphite as an alternative P source.",

These nonlinear photocurrent properties could be further extended with broken time reversal symmetry present in magnetic materials, however, the combination of time reversal and rotation symmetry breaking has not been fully explored. Herein, we investigate the nonlinear photovoltaic responses in van der Waals heterostructure compromising of monolayer semiconductor and layered magnetic material, MoS2/CrPS4; a system with broken P- and T-symmetry. We clearly observe the finite spontaneous photocurrent as shift current at the interface of the MoS2/CrPS4 heterostructure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spontaneous photocurrent drastically changes according to the magnetic phases of CrPS4. The magnetic phase dependent spontaneous nonlinear photocurrent provides a platform for studying nonlinear photoresponses in systems with broken P- and T-symmetry, and the potential development of magnetic controllable photovoltaic devices.",

Recently, 2D quantum-tunneling NDR devices have attracted considerable attention because of the inherent atomically flat and dangling-bond-free surfaces of 2D materials. However, the low current density of 2D NDR devices limits their operating frequency to less than 2 MHz. In this study, graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/graphene resonant tunneling transistors (RTTs) were fabricated using graphene and h-BN barriers with different numbers of atomic layers, showing a mechanism enabling the observation of NDR in high current density devices. A triangular etching approach was proposed to suppress the effects of graphene–metal contact resistance and graphene sheet resistance, enabling pronounced NDR effect even in a 2D tunneling device with a single atomic layer h-BN barrier. A room-temperature peak current density up to 2700 μA/μm2 and operational frequencies up to 11 GHz were achieved, demonstrating the potential of 2D quantum NDR devices for applications in high-speed electronics.",

Despite these growing threats, current agrochemical delivery remains untargeted and inefficient. In this study, we develop \n              s\n            urface ligand-\n              e\n            ngineered \n              n\n            anoparticles for targeted \n              d\n            elivery to \n              s\n            tomata (SENDS), a nanocarrier system designed to target stomatal guard cells, which serve as key pathogen entry points into the plant apoplast. Our approach employs rational ligand engineering of porous nanoparticles, optimizing ligand orientation for efficient stomata targeting across different plant species. Foliar application of SENDS encapsulating an antimicrobial plant alkaloid reduces colonization of Xanthomonas campestris, a major crop pathogen, by 20-fold compared to untargeted nanocarriers. Quantitative assessment of stomatal aperture movement and photosynthetic performance confirms that SENDS enhance plant defense against invading pathogens without disrupting natural stomatal function. This nanobiotechnology approach provides a targeted strategy to improve plant disease resistance, offering new insights into nanocarrier design for more resilient and sustainable agriculture.",

Here, we investigate the utility of combining these assays. Specifically, we carry out an MPRA in induced human neurons on over 50,000 sequences derived from fetal neuronal ATAC-seq datasets and enhancers validated in mouse assays. We also test the impact of over 20,000 variants, including synthetic mutations and 167 common variants associated with psychiatric disorders. We find a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity. Four out of five tested variants with significant MPRA effects affected neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos. Mouse assays also reveal pleiotropic variant effects that could not be observed in MPRA. Our work provides a catalog of functional neuronal enhancers and variant effects and highlights the effectiveness of combining MPRAs and mouse transgenic assays.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The emplacement of large igneous provinces (LIPs) is known to be a driver of climate change in Earth’s past. However, the balance of climate warming through CO2 emission and cooling through weathering is poorly understood. To better understand the role of LIP emplacement on long-term climate change, here we utilize the SCION coupled climate-biogeochemical model which considers the impact of LIPs through degassing of CO2 and enhancement of local continental weathering rates. This approach results in better correspondence between the modelled output and proxy reconstructions of the period (especially for seawater Sr isotope composition) when compared to previous modelling studies. Of the seven LIPs during the breakup phase of Pangaea (approximately 300–150 Ma), only the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) drives noticeable long-term cooling in the model, a minor effect (between 1-2 °C) despite emplacement of a very large surface area in the humid tropics. Similarly, only the CAMP imparts a significant change in the long-term Sr isotope record whereas the other LIPs of this period do not. Due to limited areal extents, and emplacement outside tropical weathering zones, we conclude most LIPs have no significant global cooling effect on multimillion year timescales.",

Here, we develop a lab-on-device system for molybdenum oxide to probe operando hydrogenation mechanisms through in situ electrical and spectral characterization with density functional theory calculations, revealing threshold-driven proton dynamics that govern the transition between nonvolatile memory operation and catalytic hydrogen evolution. Moderate proton intercalation (flux 17 cm-2) achieves a five-order conductance modulation under ambient conditions via polaron formation and stoichiometric optimization (H/Mo up to 22%, Mo/O approaching ideal ratios), outperforming oxygen vacancy engineering. Beyond this threshold (flux ~1017 cm-2), intensive proton intercalation triggers electric-to-chemical energy conversion, directly linking proton history to catalytic activity. Leveraging these principles, we achieve nonvolatile electrochemical memory with linear synaptic and accumulative neuronal functionalities, and demonstrate an all electrochemical random-access memory neural network hardware that executes memory-efficient rank-order coding for sparse signals even under noisy conditions.",

Traditional high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), while useful, is often limited by a distribution bias towards materials not aligned with the desired functionalities. To overcome these limitations, this study adopts a “deep dreaming” methodology to optimise MOFs in silico, aiming to generate structures with systematically shifted properties that are closer to target functionalities from the outset. Our approach integrates property prediction and structure optimisation within a single interpretable framework, leveraging a specialised chemical language model augmented with attention mechanisms. Focusing on a curated set of MOF properties critical to applications like carbon capture and energy storage, we demonstrate how deep dreaming can be utilised as a tool for targeted material design.",

Droughts can worsen air quality in regions that rely on hydropower by shifting energy production to combustion power plants. This study quantifies drought-induced excess PM2.5 in Latin America and the Caribbean, where over 443 million people live within 50 km of a combustion power plant. Leveraging a monthly plant-level panel spanning 20 years, we link hydrological droughts, measured as negative runoff anomalies in hydropower watersheds, to changes in PM2.5 concentrations near combustion power plants. Our analysis reveals that these droughts lead to an average increase of 0.83 μg m−3 in PM2.5 levels. Counterfactual simulations for the region reveal that this excess PM2.5 results in up to 10,000 premature deaths annually. Combining our estimates with climate, demographic, and combustion power plant phase-out projections, we demonstrate that this health burden will persist over the next four decades without targeted interventions.",

While clinically heterogeneous, converging evidence suggests a shared brain network may underlie tremor across conditions. Here, we empirically define such a network using four modalities: lesion locations, atrophy patterns, EMG-fMRI, and deep brain stimulation outcomes. We show that network connectivity robustly explains clinical outcomes in independent cohorts undergoing deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson’s disease and the ventral intermediate nucleus for essential tremor. Maps from each cohort accounted for outcomes in the respective other, supporting a disorder-independent tremor network. A multimodal agreement map revealed consistent substrates in the primary motor cortex and motor cerebellum. To validate the network, we test its predictive power in a third, independent cohort treated with pallidal stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. Our findings define a robust, cross-condition tremor network that may guide both invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation strategies.",

Intratumoral therapy with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) can revert immunosuppression but leakage into the circulation causes treatment-limiting toxicity. Here we engineer an IL-12Fc fusion cytokine with reduced binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn. FcRn-silenced IL-12Fc avoids FcRn-mediated brain export, thus exhibits prolonged brain retention and reduced blood levels, which prevents toxicity. In murine glioblastoma, FcRn-silenced IL-12Fc induces more durable responses with negligible systemic cytokine exposure and boosts the efficacy of radio- and chemotherapy. It triggers anti-tumor responses independently of peripheral T cell influx or lymphopenia and leads to inflammatory polarization of the tumor microenvironment in patient-derived glioblastoma explants. FcRn-silencing of IL-12Fc may unlock the full potential of IL-12 for brain cancer therapy and could be further applied to containing the activity of other therapeutics targeting neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "The development of inherently flexible battery electrodes remains a key challenge for modern wearable electronics. Despite the advancement of flexible Lithium‐ion (Li+) batteries, achieving full adaptability requires redesigning individual battery components. Conventional graphite electrodes are used in Li+ batteries but remain rigid and brittle, limiting applications in flexible energy storage. Here, this limitation is addressed by integrating nanocellulose (NCF), a nanoscale biopolymer, with graphite (G), to yield an intrinsically flexible electrode platform. Five NCF/G battery electrode compositions with increasing NCF content (40–70 wt%) are fabricated via a straightforward aqueous route and are evaluated in Li+ half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li+ and NCF surface groups suggesting Li+ diffusion through nanochannels. A perspective on the material‐driven reshaping of flexible NCF/G battery electrodes is provided, by investigating the contribution of NCF to charge storage mechanisms and to mechanical resilience. This study contributes to the development of battery electrodes that can be tailored to energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics applications, and towards battery market diversification.",

    "abstract": "The electroreduction of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers promising opportunities for the synthesis of valuable chemical precursors. However, achieving high selectivity in this process remains challenging due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved. Here, this study employs different electrochemical techniques to analyze each of the HMF electroreduction pathways. These findings demonstrate that the primary products of HMF electroreduction are 2,5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 5‐methylfurfural alcohol (MFA), with lower formation of 5‐methylfurfural (5‐MF) and 2,5‐dimethylfuran. This study identifies a significant competition between hydrogen evolution reaction and the reduction of HMF and 5‐MF that affect the faradaic efficiencies of the organic transformation. In contrast, BHMF and MFA display a reduced reactivity, behaving as terminal molecules. Through impedance analysis, it is possible to follow the reaction pathways by associating each reaction step with the changes observed in charge transfer and accumulation phenomena. These are key parameters for understanding the reaction mechanisms in the system as they allow to distinguish between adsorption, absorption and reaction of the organic molecules onto the electrode surface. This approach helps to accurately select the optimal potential for the reduction reactions. The results obtained in this study facilitate the design of efficient and selective electrocatalytic systems for biomass conversion.",

Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that DDEI undergoes highly efficient trans‐to‐cis isomerization under green light (500 nm) irradiation, achieving a remarkable yield of 97%, with both isomers exhibiting excellent thermal stability. In contrast to 8‐ and 9‐membered cyclic azobenzenes and in line with conventional linear azobenzenes, the trans configuration of DDEI is more stable than the cis configuration. This combination of synthetic accessibility and superior photophysical properties makes DDEI a promising candidate for various applications, including those in living systems.",

    "abstract": "Catalyst dissolution is one of the key challenges in achieving long‐term performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with low iridium loading. However, most of the dissolved catalyst remains in the catalyst‐coated membrane, inaccessible for operando quantification. While simpler aqueous model systems improve mechanistic understanding, dissolution rates are significantly overestimated compared to the device level. To bridge this gap, herein, an electrochemical half‐cell setup that mimics the anode catalyst layer environment to enable operation at relevant current densities (>1 ) is presented. Dissolved catalyst species transported through the porous transport layer or through the membrane are separately detected operando by coupling to inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate a strong preference for the transport of dissolved iridium through the membrane (99.9%) and a decrease in catalyst stability by factor 10 at high current densities. Discrepancies with so far reported findings from full‐cell and half‐cell experiments highlight a lack of understanding of catalyst dissolution and the transportation of dissolved species in different systems. The presented method offers unique insights which will help to study and optimize catalyst dissolution by means of various manufacturing and operation parameters to ultimately improve the stability of catalyst layers for water electrolysis.",

In the presence of the weak acid, methanol (MeOH), 1 reduces CO2 to both CO (Faradaic Efficiency maximum [FEmax] of 16 ± 6%) and HCOO− (FEmax = 20%) and produces H2 (FEmax = 56 ± 4%). Without added MeOH, 1 reacts with adventitious water to form H2 (FEmax = 85 ± 1%), HCOO− (FEmax = 7.8%), and CO (FEmax = 7 ± 3%) with CO32− being detected by infrared spectroscopy.  Product formation is potential dependent: more negative potentials increases selectivity for HCOO− over CO. The first reduction of 1 forms a pdt‐bridged dimer, 2. However, the reduction of 2 at the potentials required for electrochemical CO2 reduction leads to two new species. Using density functional theory, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR‐SEC), these structures are identified to be [Fe(CO)4]2− (3) and a trinuclear Fe3 species (4). While these species can reduce CO2 to CO and HCOO−, the predominant formation of H2 reveals kinetic issues in  CO2 reduction. The work offers to consider alternate competing mechanistic pathways and explains the lack of product selectivity when using hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO−.",

Enhancing OER efficiency is essential for reducing energy barriers and improving system performance. In this study, it develops a composite catalyst of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ and IrO2 (PBSCF‐Ir), with a surface area of 18.68 m2g−1. The PBSCF‐Ir composite exhibits a low overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and stability over 300 h. In water splitting tests, it achieves a lower cell voltage (1.95 V at 500 mA cm−2) compared to pure IrO2. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a 1 eV blueshift in Co 2p energy levels, indicating modified electronic structures. Density functional theory calculations show that IrO2 shifts the d‐band centers of Co and Fe, enhancing electrophilicity, OH− affinity, and OER activity.

Recent studies on tuning the microenvironment near the catalyst surfaces by tuning the local electric field in nonaqueous environments have been shown to promote eCO2R by facilitating the CO2 activation step. Herein, the use of tetraethylammonium (TEA) cation to tune the electric field on Fe surfaces, such that it leads to the formation of industrially relevant oxalates (C2 products), is reported. At optimal cation concentrations, the developed eCO2R system achieves 25 mA cm−2 of current density and Faradaic Efficiencies up to 75% toward oxalate. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of surface‐adsorbed TEA cations and other species on the Fe surfaces, leading to the well‐known outer‐sphere mechanism of electron transfer during eCO2R. The employment of Fe, along with microenvironment tuning, not only demonstrates high catalytic performance but also provides a safer and more sustainable alternative to toxic catalysts such as Pb that dominate the nonaqueous eCO2R literature. These findings pave the way for further optimization and scale‐up of the process, offering a viable route for sustainable chemical production and CO2 mitigation.",

    "abstract": "With global energy demand increasing alongside population growth, the importance of efficient, clean energy conversion systems like fuel cells and batteries intensifies. Fuel cells are recognized for their ability to generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen, with water as the only byproduct, and can also function in reverse as energy storage systems by producing hydrogen. Batteries chemically store energy and enable zero‐carbon emissions through their closed‐loop functionality. As demand grows, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is more actively used for investigating various electrochemical and physicochemical properties within electrochemical systems. Furthermore, EIS can serve as an in situ analysis method during operation, making it even more impactful in the near future. This article reviews the studies and applications of EIS, an advanced technique that provides insights into the electrochemical reaction at the interfaces and charge transfer processes within these systems. In addition, it provides an overview of the electrochemical principles governing these technologies, with a focus on the distinct roles and mechanisms of their components.

First, the electrochemical deposition potentials are altered in equivalent electrolyte conditions, which is found to alter the size of the deposited nanomaterials and the corresponding electrode surface roughness. Second, the electrodes are soaked in thiol‐containing solutions containing a range of both aromatic and aliphatic thiols to achieve chemically modified self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the electrode surfaces. The surface and morphological properties of the electrodeposited electrodes are assessed with scanning electron microscopy, laser confocal, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Confocal and AFM also allow the determination of the surface roughness of the electrodes at both the microscale and the nanoscale. The presence of SAM‐modification is determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angles are also measured on the nonthiol‐modified and thiol‐modified electrodes, and the contact angle is found to increase from 70°–100° to 130°–140°, close to superhydrophobic levels of contact angles.",

Herein, a propylene carbonate (PC)‐based electrolyte system is reported, employing hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as synergistic additives. Specifically, HFB facilitates compatibility with graphite anodes through selective interfacial adsorption, while the decomposition of FEC stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), mitigating the formation of high‐impedance interfaces. This tailored electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity, excellent oxidative stability, and broad temperature tolerance. When validated at 4.5 V, high‐loading NCM811/graphite cells achieve nearly full capacity over 100 cycles at low temperatures (−20 °C), with pouch cells retaining 80% of their capacity after 470 cycles.

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) with their unique structural tunability, redox properties, and high surface area have emerged as promising candidates for the OER process. In this work, a presentation on how linker functionalization in rather unexplored manganese‐based MOFs leads to enhanced OER activity is given. A series of manganese‐based MOFs in rarely reported MIL‐88B structure (Mn‐MIL‐88‐X) is synthesized using functionalized linkers [X = NH2, NO2, Br]. The objective is to modulate the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of the MOFs leading to enhanced OER activity. Among functionalized MOFs, Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 shows remarkable performance, requiring only 260 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1. The improvement in OER activity of Mn‐MIL‐88‐NH2 is ascribed to the higher oxidation states of manganese (Mn3+/Mn4+) and the presence of the amino group (‐NH2) as confirmed through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work paves the way for the designing and exploring of mixed‐valence state metal‐based MOFs as advanced electrode materials for electrocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTin (IV) sulfide (SnS2) is a promising anode material for Li‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high practical reversible capacity of 623 mAhg−1. However, its cycling stability is relatively poor and its long‐term degradation during cycling is not yet thoroughly investigated. In this work, a post‐mortem analysis of SnS2 electrodes was performed at pristine state, after the 1st cycle and at 80 % state‐of‐health. The analysis compared water‐based (Na‐CMC/SBR) and NMP‐based (PVDF) electrodes revealing insights into their degradation mechanisms and electrochemical performance. During the first cycle, SnS2 converts into Sn and Li2S identified by XRD, causing particle cracking and exfoliation. XPS and Raman spectroscopy identified Sn, SnFx, LiF, Li2S and carbonates species forming the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), while in‐situ dilatometry revealed up to 60 % irreversible expansion after the first cycle.

    "abstract": "Engineering catalyst layer structure is of significant importance to improve the performance and durability of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), yet rare efficient design strategies has been reported. This work develops an in situ pore‐making approach to construct cross‐linked porous catalyst layer, which significantly improves catalyst active site utilization compared to conventional catalyst layer (CCL). The electrochemical activity area of the porous catalyst layer membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) (52.22 cm2 mgIr−1) is 2.10 times higher than that of the CCL‐MEA (24.90 cm2 mgIr−1), which indicates that more active sites are exposed during pore‐making process, leading to the higher utilization efficiency of the electrocatalyst. As a result, the porous catalyst layer exhibits a high current density of 3.8 A cm−2 at 1.9 V, which is exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 target (3 A cm−2@1.9 V), and shows superior durability with no significant degradation after 1600 h of operation at a constant load of 2 A cm−2. Scanning electron microscope analysis confirms the structural integrity of the porous catalyst layer, while cracks formed in the CCL during testing. These results highlight the benefits of the porous structure in improving mass transport, stability, and overall performance in PEMWE applications.",

All synthesized samples are characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, UPS, and Kelvin probe methods confirming the formation of the target materials. UPS and Kelvin probe results demonstrate an alteration of the Fermi level position in Ti‐doped BiVO4 depending on the dopant concentration. Consequently, heterostructured electrodes based on pristine and Ti(10 at%)‐doped BiVO4 are formed providing the maximum gradient between the Fermi level position of the heterostructure's components. Photoelectrochemical studies demonstrate that Ti doping significantly affects the behavior of electrodes switching them from anodic to cathodic regime. Moreover, either anodic or cathodic behavior of heterostructured electrodes depends on the spatial layer‐by‐layer construction of the electrodes, that is, on the direction of the Fermi level gradient between heterostructure's components. Photoelectrochemical experiments performed with a tandem photoelectrochemical cell with two photoactive electrodes based on pristine and Ti(10 at%)‐doped BiVO4 demonstrate that stable photocurrent in the system is generated only when both photoelectrodes are photoexcited that confirms that the pre‐existing Fermi level gradient between the two electrodes induces the driving force for photoelectrochemical activity in the tandem cell.",

    "abstract": "Due to their high theoretical energy density and the abundance of magnesium, rechargeable Mg batteries are promising candidate systems for future energy storage. However, finding suitable electrolytes that are compatible with the metallic Mg electrode and enable highly reversible Mg plating is still challenging. Typical electrolytes for rechargeable magnesium batteries are based on ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME), or higher glymes. Drawbacks are the high volatilites and low flashpoints of THF and DME and their harmfulness, problematic factors for industrial applicability. One potential alternative is diethylene glycol diethyl ether (DEGDEE) which is also an ether, but has significantly higher boiling and flashpoints than THF and DME, and is from today's perspective less harmful than any of the previously mentioned solvents. To test the suitability and stability of this class of electrolytes, different Mg salts in combination with DEGDEE for their electrochemical Mg plating and stripping properties are studied. Although Mg deposition needs higher overpotentials than for their DME‐based counterparts, the investigated electrolytes enable reversible Mg plating with relatively high Coulombic efficiencies, making DEGDEE a promising alternative electrolyte solvent for rechargeable Mg batteries.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to value‐added products using renewable electricity offers a promising approach toward achieving carbon neutrality. Among various electrocatalysts, molecular catalysts, particularly transition metal complexes, stand out due to the high selectivity for single specific products and desirable tunability, enabling rational optimization of catalytic performance. However, their practical application is hindered by low operating current densities and challenges in catalyst recycling. To address these limitations, immobilizing molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces has emerged as an effective strategy for integrating selective molecular catalysts into heterogeneous catalysis. This mini review focuses on a distinct category of heterogenized molecular catalysts—those molecularly dispersed and supported on substrates or electrode surfaces‐which exhibit remarkable catalytic activity at the single‐molecule level and the ability to drive deep CO2 reduction (beyond two electrons) under certain conditions. Recent progress in this field is comprehensively discussed, emphasizing the critical impacts of molecule‐level dispersion and catalyst‐support interactions on electronic properties, multi‐electron transfer kinetics, and overall catalytic performance. Moreover, the overview of potential applications of supported molecular catalysts beyond electrochemical CO2R is provided at the end. This mini review aims to offer valuable insights for the future design of efficient and scalable electrocatalysts for sustainable CO2 conversion.",

However, they suffer from irreversible structural transformations and detrimental interfacial reactions, especially under deep charge/discharge states, causing severe voltage fade and capacity degradation. Herein, Li‐rich binary oxide Li1.16(Ni0.25Mn0.75)0.84O2 is proposed to dual‐coated by superionic conductor Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 and conductive polymer polyaniline, displaying nearly two orders of magnitude promotion for lithium ion transmission coefficient (10−9.5 cm2 S−1) at the end of charge/discharge. COMSOL Multiphysics simulation indicates the synergistic interfacial coating elevates the homogeneous distribution of lithium–ions and current density, improving utilization rates of lithium–ions, mitigating irreversible structural transformation, and suppressing the dissolution of transition metal ions and side reactions between the cathode and electrolyte. Therefore, Li1.16(Ni0.25Mn0.75)0.84O2 with the significantly promoted charge transfer kinetics exhibits greatly strengthened specific capacity of 293.6 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 within the range of 2.0–4.8 V, with an increased initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.42% and capacity retention of 88.94% in 150 cycles, alongside with a low voltage decay (0.23 V within 150 cycles) and a high rate capability of 160 mAh g−1 at 5 C.",

The carboxylate ions that are released during the proton transfer steps associate with the phenylhydroxylamine and make its oxidation also concerted.

Operational tests reveal significant performance degradation in both direct decaborane fuel cells (DDFCs) and direct hydrazine borane fuel cells (DHBFCs). In DDFCs, a severe 81.6% loss of initial peak power density occurs within 1 h, mainly attributed to the structural instability of the anode catalyst layer and cathode catalyst poisoning. For DHBFCs, a 46.4% performance decline is observed in the same period, with the accumulation of electrochemical byproducts at both electrodes being the primary cause. To address these issues, various optimization strategies are used. For DDFCs, replacing the anode substrate, adjusting the ionomer/carbon ratio, and using a more poison‐resistant cathode catalyst prove effective. In the case of DHBFCs, improving the anode gas diffusion layer and adopting AEMs significantly enhance performance. After optimization, DDFCs exhibit only a 6.7% performance degradation over 50 h of operation, while DHBFCs retain 95.7% of their initial performance. These findings provide crucial insights into the degradation mechanisms and optimization approaches for B/N‐H‐based fuel cell systems, facilitating their potential application in practical energy scenarios.",

A major obstacle to improving PEMFC durability is reactive oxygen species (ROS) that deteriorate PEMFC performance by oxidizing membrane electrode assembly (MEA). While CeOx‐based nanomaterials are widely used as antioxidants, they often undergo decline in efficacy by their nanostructure deformation, hampering stable PEMFC operation. Here, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are reported as a stabilizer for antioxidants, effectively alleviating the CeOx disintegration. MSNs facilitate the formation of uniformly dispersed CeOx nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm having abundant oxygen vacancies and high proportion of Ce(III) oxidation states. The well‐defined mesoporous structure of MSNs effectively confines CeOx in the internal voids and prevents CeOx agglomeration, thereby exhibiting sustained antioxidation efficacy within the Pt/C‐based electrodes. Importantly, CeOx/MSN mitigates the MEA degradation, retaining 95% of PEMFC performance even after 100 h durability tests under the ROS‐rich environment.",

Our results indicate that the presence of transition metal contaminants accelerates electrolyte aging, leading to the formation of decomposition products such as HF, OPF2(OH), and OPF(OCH3)2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling reveal that these impurities contribute to increased charge transfer resistance and capacity fading.

This review examines the technical challenges in developing RAB technologies, based on the direct experience of research group, emphasizing the critical role of selecting appropriate electrolytes, passive components, and cell setups for understanding and correctly assessing electrode material performance. RABs are still in their infancy and to build a comprehensive bibliography, technical challenges should be thoroughly documented and addressed.

    "abstract": "A wireless potentiometric sensor offers a robust platform for detecting microbial growth, which is crucial for managing infected wounds that can lead to serious complications such as tissue spread, systemic infection, or sepsis, potentially resulting in life‐threatening conditions. Herein, a solid‐state potentiometric working/reference electrode system with a Bluetooth‐enabled system on a chip, supporting continuous wireless monitoring of microbial growth is shown. The sensor monitors open circuit potentials (OCPs) in culture media, which significantly decrease due to bacterial growth after inoculation with Gram‐positive Staphylococcus aureus, Gram‐negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Notably, Staphylococcus aureus demonstrates lower electrogenic activity compared with the Gram‐negative bacteria, likely owing to its reduced viability. Following thorough in vitro testing, the sensor is also evaluated ex vivo. Stable connections between the sensor and a smartphone receiver ensure reliable data collection and processing, facilitating remote monitoring. A slight decrease in OCP is observed in rat wounds inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and significant decrease with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Incorporation of the wireless sensing module for continuous measurement and data collection can greatly enhance early detection capabilities regarding bacterial infections in wounds. This setup offers a convenient and effective method for point‐of‐care sensing, significantly advancing the management and treatment of wound infections.",

    "abstract": "As a by‐product of biofuel production, glycerol needs to find its use in various applications, for example, as a substrate for electrosynthesis of more valuable chemicals. The glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in aqueous media is technologically feasible but produces various products with hard‐to‐control selectivity. Less explored is the electrooxidation of anhydrous glycerol, which theoretically limits possible products to aldehydes/ketones, including high‐cost glyceraldehyde. Herein, the GOR with gold electrodes is investigated using glycerol and acetonitrile as solvents without and with base, TEMPO (2,2,6,6‐tetramethylpiperidine 1‐oxyl) redox mediator, and a copper(I)‐bipyridyl catalyst added into the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide electrolyte solutions. Both redox‐mediated and heterogeneous oxidation are slow when glycerol is used as a solvent even at 90 °C, as in particular probed by Fourier‐transformed alternating current voltammetry. Redox‐mediated glycerol oxidation to glyceraldehyde is achieved in acetonitrile at a yield rate of 6 ± 3 nmol s−1 cm−2, but the reaction essentially stops after ≈1 h of electrolysis. Heterogeneous catalytic GOR in acetonitrile is more stable but requires significantly more positive potentials and produces a mix of products. While demonstrating the possibility of selective anhydrous glycerol electrooxidation, our results highlight the need for improvements in the mediator and catalyst designs.",

Despite the promising character of the presented concept, literature does not show any follow‐up study or successful reproduction of the results. The common denominator among all further studies that involve sulfide oxidation is the working electrode: The use of plain graphite instead of cobalt impregnated graphite results in irreversible electrode blockage by build‐up of elemental sulfur (S0). In this—purely abiotic—study, the electrochemical properties of cobalt‐deposited electrodes are investigated when brought in contact with sulfide‐containing solutions. This study thereby shows that cobalt acts as a catalyst accelerating the oxidation of S2− to higher oxidation products, thereby avoiding sulfur build‐up on the electrode surface. The sulfide oxidation can proceed directly at the cobalt oxide surface, or via a soaking and subsequent oxidation mechanism. In this process, the cobalt layer itself is “charged” by transformation to cobalt sulfide (CoS), which is subsequently “discharged” oxidatively resulting in the production of current. The insights presented here pave the way for a replication and utilization of the original results by Habermann and Pommer.",

    "abstract": "While the concept of storing electrons in chemical bonds is not new, innovative approaches to achieve it continue to emerge. This applies to the structronic (STR) electrochemical paradigm. Typically, when strategically positioned in space, electrophoric components within STR functional assemblies—featuring potent electrophilic centers (i.e., atomic orbitals with a significant contribution to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of their redox‐active components)—can engage in direct electronic interactions through σ‐type orbital overlap, creating a set of so‐called supra‐molecular orbitals (supra‐MOs). The core idea is to fill the potentially bonding supra‐LUMO with electrons, thereby storing them in the form of a weakened (elongated) reservoir bond. This approach bypasses electrostatic limitations by leveraging the quantum behavior of electrons within covalent bonds. STR assemblies are bistable systems that can be electrochemically cycled, allowing for the charging and discharging of stored electrons. This concept article aims to define the conditions necessary for generating these supra‐MOs, explore their electrochemical characteristics (such as hysteretic electrochemical behaviors and inversion of redox potentials), and highlight potential applications in advanced energy storage and other fields within the dynamic scope of electrochemistry.",

A complete structural investigation through neutron diffraction and thermal operando synchrotron X‐ray diffraction elucidates the phase evolution during oxidation. In coin cell tests against lithium, both samples demonstrate initial anodic capacities attributed to irreversible conversion reactions, followed by reversible alloying/dealloying mechanisms. Similarly, tests against sodium show comparable electrochemical behavior, albeit with lower capacities due to sodium's lower reactivity with Sn oxide. The capacity retention after cycling can be associated to the structural stability of the electrodes. Overall, this study has a place in the broader framework of the Sn‐doped MAX phases investigation, and once more it underscores the importance of optimizing Sn oxide formation for enhanced electrochemical performance in both Li‐ion and Na‐ion batteries, with implications for future active materials design.",

Herein, we report the localized formation of SEI microspots on HC using cyclic voltammetry in combination with scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) in non‐aqueous ether‐ and carbonate‐based electrolytes. Using the same instrumental setup for SECCM and for atomic force microscopy (AFM), the locally formed SEI spots could be directly characterized with respect to the morphology, height, passivation and nanomechanical properties in dependence of the experimental deposition parameters such as scan rate and cycling number. In addition, time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS) in combination with AFM revealed the chemical composition of the SEI layer by recording spatially resolved 3D mass maps of the SEI spots. This combination of high‐resolution microscopic and spectrometric methods provides new insights into the dynamics of SEI formation as a function of the electrolyte and the experimental parameters.",

However, degradation mechanisms may lead to hazardous conditions, such as thermal runaway. Solely relying on capacity changes for state of health (SOH) assessment is insufficient, given the complexity of LIBs. This work introduces comprehensive real‐time insights for state of health prediction (CRISP), a novel framework for comprehensive SOH assessment and degradation mechanisms identification. Using data from commercial LIBs, CRISP runs on a low‐cost Raspberry Pi with remote monitoring capabilities, generating aged anode half‐cell voltages for each reference performance test (RPT) as references for lithium plating assessment. CRISP processed the data of each RPT in ≈2.9 s and outputs multiple physical quantities for SOH evaluation. Results show that LIBs cycled at 100% depth of discharge (DOD) exhibited greater cathode material loss compared to those cycled at narrower DODs. However, no dendritic lithium deposition is detected by evaluating and correlating the physical parameters provided by CRISP. In summary, this study highlights the importance of multi‐parameter SOH assessment, demonstrating that single‐parameter methods (e.g., capacity‐based) fail to capture the full scope of LIBs health.",

In this study, a simplified droplet‐free digital enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system is developed based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging for the sensitive detection of CRP. This system eliminates the need for droplet or microwell arrays, significantly simplifying the workflow while maintaining high sensitivity. Tyramide signal amplification was employed to enhance signal generation, relying on its localized reaction to achieve precise single‐particle amplification with minimal signal diffusion. The developed assay is capable of detecting poly‐horseradish peroidase at concentrations as low as 1.0 fmol L−1 and successfully adhered to the Poisson distribution model for digital quantification. The application of this system to CRP detection yields a limit of detection of 17.0 pg mL−1 (162 fmol L−1). The ECL bead ratio increases proportionally with CRP concentration, enabling accurate quantification. Moreover, the system exhibits high specificity, showing no response to other biomolecules and maintaining precise detection even in complex biological samples such as human serum.

Herein, three alternate π‐conjugated biphenyl/terphenyl substituents are attached to the TTM unit. Results reveal that connection modes and types of benzene ring derivatives lead to distinct charge transfer (CT) and locally excited state hybrid emitters due to the differences in conjugation degree. All three radicals exhibit polarity‐insensitive red emission (626–690 nm), and their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) increase with solvent polarity. Specifically, linear‐conjugated TTM‐DPh has higher photostability but lower PLQY, while nonlinear‐conjugated TTM‐3DPh and TTM‐TPh have nearly 10‐fold higher PLQYs. The photophysical studies suggest that the conjugation degree and hybridization level between CT and ground states account for these properties.",

This research in two‐photon‐induced photopolymerization for 3D microfabrication led to groundbreaking performance, thanks to the use of custom π‐extended molecular architectures as photoinitiators.

The energy transfer mechanism between sensitized ions and activated ions is discussed with the help of fluorescence spectra and decay curve in details. Notably, different from other phosphors based on this host material, these prepared phosphors exhibit typical anomalous thermal quenching. It is very favorable for the devices working at high temperature. And this phenomenon may benefit from the high energy transfer efficiency at higher temperatures. The tunable white light and anomalous thermal quenching indicate that the studied material is a promising solid‐state emitting phosphor for the white light‐emitting diodes.",

Herein, a series of enaminitrile switches are explored as protofluorochromic entities by modulation of their structures, assisted by density functional theory calculations. The switches show high stabilities and exhibit reversible E/Z isomerization behavior, along with tunable fluorescence intensity in both protic and aprotic media. Switches based on 2‐pyridyl‐ or 2‐pyridylmethyl‐containing N‐components exhibit strong fluorescence in their protonated Z‐configurations, compared to their phenyl/benzyl counterparts. This behavior can be attributed to variations in intramolecular charge transfer or excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer effects.

    "abstract": "Polymethine cyanine dyes have a heterocyclic structure containing nitrogen at both ends of the polymethine chain. They have been extensively investigated in material sciences for numerous applications. The synthesis of cyanine dyes with various functional groups on the methine chain has attracted significant attention because it significantly alters the properties of the dye. However, few synthetic methods have been reported for directly introducing groups onto the methine chains of cyanine dyes. Ketone functional groups are essential in synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials chemistry. However, there are no reports on the direct introduction of ketone groups into cyanine dyes. Trifluoroacetylation is performed on the methine chains of polymethine cyanine dyes. This is achieved by directly using anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid to synthesize trifluoroacetylated trimethine, pentamethine, and heptamethine cyanine dyes in good yields. Single‐crystal X‐ray structural analysis is performed to determine the substitution positions in the synthesized dyes. The results reveal that trifluoroacetylation of the methine chain shortens the maximum absorption wavelength and decreases the molar absorption coefficient in dichloromethane solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) film compared to an unsubstituted cyanine dye, and decreases the fluorescence quantum yield. This study highlights the unique properties of trifluoroacetylated polymethine cyanine dyes.",

Herein, bismuth manganate (BMO) is investigated as a photoanode absorber material for PEC. BMO thin films are prepared by a sol–gel method with and without a bismuth oxide (BO) overlayer. It is found that the BO overlayer forms BO nanoislands after annealing. Under visible light illumination, BMO with BO nanoislands results in a nearly tenfold increase of the current density compared to pristine BMO at the same applied potential. This increased performance is related to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and in the amount of recombinations based on the formation of a favorable heterojunction between BMO and BO. The application of overlayers on electrode materials in combination with suitable band alignment is an effective strategy to improve the performance of PEC electrodes.",

Notably, photovoltaic performance measurements show that solar cells sensitized with the covalent dyad exhibit significantly enhanced efficiencies compared with those using the reference compounds and other “ZnP‐Acceptor” dyads.

Thereinto, chemical composition tunability of organic component, metal ions, and halogen provides multiple adjustable sites to tailor their structures and physicochemical properties.

Quantum chemical calculations are also carried out to support the experimental findings. An optimization of the doping concentration in the CBP blends is necessary to reduce the strong aggregation. This optimization led for both near‐infrared‐emitting dyes to a substantial increase of the photoluminescence quantum yield, which can reach values as high as 60%. It is also found that the blend films show excellent ASE properties with a threshold as low as 3.5–4.5 μJ cm−2 for peak wavelengths of 739 and 727 nm.

Control experiments suggest that these excitation‐dependent luminescent properties originate from the coexistence of gold(I)–π aggregates and gold(I)–gold(I)‐interacted oligomers, which exhibit higher and lower bandgap energies, respectively.",

A series of Nb2O5 photocatalysts are prepared using a simple thermal approach, and their photocatalytic performance for HMF oxidation is tested. Nb2O5 treated at relatively lower temperatures (300–400 °C) possesses a higher surface area with abundant surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water species, which play a key role in the HMF oxidation, affording high DFF selectivity. In contrast, Nb2O5 treated at higher temperatures (500–600 °C) exhibits an adverse effect on the photocatalytic performance due to the substantial loss of surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water species. Various structural characterizations such as X‐ray diffractometer, N2‐sorption analyses, and thermogravimetric analyser Nb2O5 treated at different temperatures. At the same time, CO2‐temperature programmed desorption (TPD), O2–TPD, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra disclose the nature and distribution of active sites, especially strong basic sites, which is essential for comprehending the interaction between HMF and the surface of the catalyst.",

Herein, a strategy is reported for achieving higher quantum yields of NIR‐light‐driven photocatalytic H2 production using salts of diprotonated dodecaphenylporphyrin (H4DPP2+(X−)2), showing large saddle distortion as organic photosensitizers and platinum nanoparticles as catalysts. When a perchlorate ion (ClO4−) is employed as a counter ion (X−) of H4DPP2+(X−)2, the quantum yield of the photocatalytic H2 production reaches to 36% by excitation at 750 nm, which is the highest value among those of NIR‐light‐driven H2 production reported so far. Such a drastic enhancement of the quantum yield is achieved by selection of X− as an appropriate counter anion of H4DPP2+, judging from second‐order rate constants of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from electron donors to 3(H4DPP2+(X−)2)* and the reorganization energy of ET for H4DPP2+(X−)2.",

Notably, the S2 composite exhibited enhanced PL intensity and extended carrier lifetimes across all studied temperatures, attributed to effective suppression of surface states via d‐electron hopping. Complementary high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses further corroborated the presence of surface defects and d‐electron hopping mechanisms, elucidating their pivotal roles in enhancing PL emission characteristics.

The activity was further enhanced, by incorporating copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) through an impregnation method, where the optimal loading of 0.01 mol% surpassed the activity of the benchmark photocatalyst TiO2 P25, with ~22 % NO and ~9 % NOx removal under visible light and ~40 % NO and ~23 % NOx under UV light.

The CO and CH4 yields of sample Cu1TB‐1.5 under visible light are 5.72 and 0.02 μmol g−1 h−1, wherein the CO yield was 15.5 times that of sample TB; its selectivity is 99.6%, and the cycling stability is excellent. OVs can broaden the light absorption of TB to the visible light region, and Cu promotes photoinduced electron transfer from TB to the Cu species and act as an active center. The OVs and Cu can synergistically enhance charge separation, CO2 adsorption, and CO2 conversion. The Cu1TB‐1.5 facilitates the formation of the intermediate COOH* during the photocatalytic process, thus improving the yield and selectivity of CO.

This review comprehensively examines recent advancements (within the last five years) in utilizing chalcogen substitution to design robust PSs/PTAs for PDT/PTT. It provides a holistic perspective on spectroscopic characterization and computational analyses, singlet‐oxygen/triplet quantum yields, heat generation efficiency, and in vitro/in vivo biological evaluations of chalcogen‐substituted PSs/PTAs.

For comparison, experimental data were obtained for 1‐methyl histidine, 3‐methyl histidine and carnosine (β‐alanyl‐histidine). The CIDNP kinetics revealed the formation of the cationic radicals of the studied methyl histidine‐containing compounds, resulting from their involvement in the reaction of degenerate electron exchange with the parent molecules, in contrast to the case of carnosine. This finding confirmed electron transfer as the mechanism of photo‐induced oxidation of methyl histidine‐containing compounds. TR CIDNP was also used to study the reduction of cation‐radicals of anserine and methyl histidines by aromatic amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine. From the modeling of CIDNP kinetic data obtained for the three‐component system containing photosensitizer, methyl histidine‐containing compound, and reducing agent, we determine the rate constants of the reduction reaction.

Herein, the surfaces of micron‐sized metal salt crystal particles serve as templates for the TBA‐2HP molecules, or in the broad sense, the salt crystal surfaces act as a “solid‐state solvent.” The salt ground matrices exhibited varied emission intensities with metal salts like alkali, alkaline earth, and zinc metal salts. The gradual change in solid state emission color from yellowish green to cyan was observed in the ground matrices of zinc acetate salt with varied amounts of TBA‐2HP. Furthermore, the electroluminescence properties of the TBA‐2HP were investigated by fabricating the TBA‐2HP‐doped polymer on the surface of a near‐ultraviolet (NUV) and blue light‐emitting diode (LED). The TBA‐2HP displayed green light emission upon coating a thin layer of TBA‐2HP‐doped polymer over the surface of a NUV LED bulb and white light emission upon coating a thin layer of TBA‐2HP along with a red phosphor‐doped polymer on the surface of a blue LED bulb. Moreover, the TBA‐2HP was utilized to detect high‐explosive picric acid in the solution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUltrasensitive detection of amyloid fibril, a biomarker of several neurological diseases, has been achieved using a hemicyanine dye. Amyloid fibril induces a remarkable change in the absorption spectral position (~115 nm) of the perchlorate salt of the probe leading to a naked‐eye detection of these neurotoxic protein aggregates. Such a large shift in the absorption spectra has been utilised to develop a simple and cost effective paper based detection of insulin aggregates with a limit of detection (LOD) of less than 2 pM. Besides the changes in the absorption spectra, the emission intensity of the probe shows almost two orders of magnitude increase in the presence of insulin amyloid fibrils. Such dual sensing properties of the present hemicyanine molecule make it a noble probe for amyloid fibrils. Our detailed investigation on the fundamental mechanism responsible for the fibril‐induced spectral changes in the dye has established the role of amyloid induced dissociation of ion‐pair and solute‐solvent hydrogen bonding in the colorimetric detection of amyloid fibrils. Quantum chemical calculations and blind molecular docking studies have also been performed to strengthen our experimental observations. This result will open up a new frontier in the field of amyloid probes based on the unique mechanism proposed in this work.",

The photochromism of the films shows reversibility. However, we show that the increase in surface polarity observed upon switching with UV light is due in large part to degradation at the surface that does not occur in the bulk of the films. Vibrational spectroscopy reveals that the initial photoswitching to the merocyanine state is followed by degradation. We show that the surface sensitivity of the technique used to monitor switching is critical to observing the changes that are responsible for the switching in surface polarity.",

By investigating solvatofluorochromism, acidochromism, and properties in the solid state, it was possible to establish that the optical properties of these dyes are coumarin ring‐dependent, which was supported by TD‐DFT calculations. In addition, fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) up to 36 % with short lifetimes decay (1.40–4.60 ns) were accompanied by a redshift behavior with electro‐donating coumarins. Remarkably, solid‐state studies showed a higher emission of the unsubstituted coumarin (ΦF=64 %) due to significant supramolecular interactions; in addition, acidochromism experiments using TFA were performed, finding detection limits of up to 1.03 μM.",

Here, excitation of the CT band results in barrierless dissociation of the CT complex on the femtosecond timescale followed by its thermally activated reformation, on the timescale of a few nanoseconds at ambient temperature. The photoreaction is thought to involve a well‐defined isomerization of the inhibitor without its dissociation from the protein. This reaction occurs with an unusually high quantum yield (~80 %), is initiated by absorption in the red part of the visible absorption spectrum, and leads to a photoproduct absorbing in the blue spectral region (negative photochromism). Therefore, this class of photoswitches can be considered a promising template for developing a new class of fast negative photochromic compounds for Life Science applications provided the lifetime of the photoproducts (‘light state’) can be prolonged. Potential future developments will be discussed.",

However, given that the reactions in question are usually the reverse of one another, it becomes imperative to handle conflicting performance criteria when optimizing the reactions. Here, studying diarylethene switches operated by electrocyclization (for storing the solar energy) and cycloreversion (for releasing the solar energy) reactions, we show that these processes can be made to simultaneously exhibit the desired characteristics by introducing a tricyclic rather than monocyclic π‐linker as the bridge between the two aryl units. Specifically, we perform quantum chemical calculations to demonstrate that such a scenario is realizable by tailoring, using aromaticity, certain parts of the tricyclic structure for electrocyclization and other parts for cycloreversion. Furthermore, employing this strategy, we identify several diarylethene switches, each with their own unique tricyclic π‐linker, that concurrently meet key performance criteria like large energy‐storage densities and long energy‐storage times. Accordingly, we conclude that there appears to be considerable structural flexibility in implementing the ideas for efficient diarylethene‐based solar‐energy storage put forth in this work.",

This work investigates an alternative method to reduce the overvoltage associated with WD operation by illuminating the BPM interface in the presence of nanoparticulate catalyst layers that exhibit plasmonic character. The plasmonic character of the catalyst enhanced the field locally near the active catalyst site, lowering the resistance associated with WD as well as the onset potential for WD. Optimal catalyst loadings allowed a balance of light absorption, catalyst activity, and field utilization. Composites of known WD catalysts that exhibited minimal light activity with a plasmonic and WD active material exhibited improvements in the WD resistance and overvoltage of up to 20 % upon irradiation. This proof‐of‐concept work introduces a new paradigm for altering WD activity in BPMs, where the optical activity of WD catalysts can provide further tunability towards efficient WD and alternative energy conversion frameworks.",

Agrochemicals are well known to exhibit poor photostability, and the addition of photoprotectants to their formulations thus increases their longevity, and thereby environmental sustainability. The results presented here shed light on the complex ultrafast and long term photodynamics of five nature‐inspired derivatives in solution and on a wax surface, the latter designed to mimic the cuticle of a plant leaf.

The thermal stabilities of the squaraine films were evaluated after thermal treatment at elevated temperatures. The film fabricated using polysulfone, which possesses a high glass‐transition temperature, maintained an absorption of >97 % after heat treatment, indicating its excellent thermal stability. Furthermore, all squaraine films maintained absorptions of >70 % after 24 h of light irradiation, surpassing the photostabilities of conventional polymethine dyes.

In this study, we report a new E,Z‐isomerization‐active green fluorescence protein chromophore (GFPc) analogue (4), which uniquely demonstrates a reversed solvent polarity effect on ΦF and a record‐high ΦF of 0.43 in the red (>600 nm) region. This is achieved by ring‐bridging both the exocyclic C−C bond (the ϕ‐bond) and the phenyl‐amino C−N bond (the ω‐bond) of a known meta‐amino‐substituted GFPc (1), which shows typical SFD behavior in aprotic solvents but fluorescence quenching in protic solvents. Based on the reference compounds 2 (ω‐bridged) and 3 (ϕ‐bridged), the reversed solvent effect is attributed to enhanced one‐bond‐flip (OBF) E,Z‐isomerization in nonpolar solvents and the inhibition of hula twist (HT) pathway, which is accelerated in polar solvents. The drastic difference in fluorescence characteristics between 1 and 4 is further underscored by the superior performance of 4 in cell imaging. This work demonstrates the versatility of the GFP chromophore, whose properties could be drastically reshaped through specific structural editing at key positions.",

Here, we demonstrate local liquid‐liquid phase separation of a temperature‐responsive ionic liquid (IL) solution by utilizing a near‐infrared laser beam. Upon focusing the laser beam onto the glass/solution interface, a single liquid droplet is formed due to optical trapping and a photothermal effect. The resultant droplet deposits on to the glass substrate, exhibiting a hemispherical shape. Under further laser irradiation, the droplet grows to a large size and increases in ionic liquid concentration, which is confirmed by Raman and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis. We observe that the droplet formation strongly depends on the surface properties of a glass substrate. We discuss the formation dynamics by considering optical and thermal potentials in addition to the interaction between the Ionic liquid and the substrate.",

FA dehydrogenation occurs under near‐ambient conditions using palladium/activated carbon (Pd/AC) catalysts, but aspects like high Pd loading and gradual catalyst deactivation remain key challenges. This study investigates how the physicochemical properties of Pd nanoparticles and support characteristics influence the continuous process performance including FA conversion, evolved gas flow rate, total hydrogen production, and catalyst durability. Pd catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation using various precursors, powdered supports, and Pd loadings and evaluated in a fixed‐bed reactor. The findings reveal that Pd/AC catalysts prepared with PdCl₂ precursor and nanopowdered AC are the most efficient. Strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged PdCl₄2⁻ species and the positively charged AC surface during impregnation enhance nanoparticle support interactions, resulting in small (∼2 nm), highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles with a high Pd2⁺/Pd⁰ atomic surface ratio. Metal dispersion is the dominant factor influencing hydrogen production, surpassing the effects of both particle size and electronic state. Higher Pd loadings also increased catalyst durability, reducing regeneration frequency. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Pd/AC catalysts, paving the way for efficient FA utilization as a hydrogen carrier.",

This semiquinonate radical conducts hydrogen atom transfer reactions to facilitate the dehydrogenation reactions of a large number of alcohols. Leveraging on the dehydrogenating ability of PD that easily conducts 2e−/2H+ redox shuttles, olefination reaction was conducted on heteroarene methyl, fluorenes under mild conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic process works under aerobic conditions since oxygen regenerates the catalyst. The methodological development is a significant improvement over many transition metal catalysts for this task, which often work at high temperature and anaerobic reaction conditions.",

For some time now, it has been known that shear is unlikely to harm most proteins directly. Rather, interfacial phenomena, particularly those involving dynamic gas‐liquid interfaces are critical contributors to protein damage, which leads to aggregation and compromises stability. This work investigated the kinetic stability of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase (HMFO; EC: 1.1.3.47) in a 2 L stirred tank reactor. Exposure experiments revealed that the leading cause of enzyme deactivation was exposure to the gas‐liquid interface, either produced deliberately when sparging gas into the system or by accidental air entrainment from the overhead space due to mechanical stirring. This was further proven by experiments using the Bio Thrust membrane module, which enabled bubble‐free aeration thus, confirming that exposure to the gas‐liquid interface is the leading cause of deactivation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA novel strategy to synthesize micro‐structured cobaltite (ACo2O4; A = Fe, Mn, Cu) catalysts with tunable catalytic properties exhibiting highly selective production of glycerol carbonate via urea glycerolysis reaction is demonstrated. FeCo2O4 microcubes, MnCo2O4 microspheres, and CuCo2O4 micro‐octahedrons were produced via an ultrasonication‐assisted hydrothermal approach. The impact of urea (U), semicarbazide (S) as structure directing agents (SDAs), and metal ion substitution (A = Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+) on catalyst morphology and acid–base active sites in cobaltite is confirmed using various material characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The enhanced catalytic properties resulted in a significant improvement in their catalytic performance, particularly in terms of activity and selectivity. The order of yield (Y) and selectivity (S) for GC production is FeCo2O4‐U microcubes (Y95 ± 3%, S99%) > MnCo2O4‐S microspheres (Y91.5 ± 3%, S98.5%) > CuCo2O4‐S micro‐octahedrons (Y83.4 ± 3%, S92.4%) > Co3O4 (Y35 ± 3%, 99%), as determined using the GC‐MS analysis. This performance is attributed to the effective catalytic activation of urea, leading to enhanced GC production via the isocyanic acid pathway. Therefore, the strategies presented in this work could be further extended to other spinel compounds to achieve desired catalytic properties for chemical transformations of industrial interest.",

This study introduces a dynamic ML‐guided approach that iteratively optimizes experimental parameters through successive cycles of ML analysis and experimentation, effectively circumventing the need for large datasets. Applied to the synthesis of photocatalysts via microwave heating of quercetin, this method yielded optimal performance after three iterations, achieving a high hydrogen peroxide production rate.

Improving hydrophilicity has been found to address this issue. CoFeCr LDH/NF, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with good hydrophilicity and a nanoflower structure, is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Hydrophilicity affects the size of bubbles produced, with better hydrophilic electrodes generating smaller, more easily disrupted bubbles. The cavitation effect upon bubble rupture releases heat, breaking water molecules to produce free OH⁻ and promoting the reconstruction of CoFeCr LDH. Additionally, the nanoflower structure of CoFeCr LDH features numerous micropores, enhancing the surface roughness of NF, and resulting in more uniform bubble sizes. Solution convection induced by ultrasound gathers small bubbles into larger ones, which are more easily removed by ultrasound. At 30 mA cm−2, ultrasound reduces the overpotential for HER and OER by 17 mV and 16 mV, respectively. Enhanced hydrophilicity significantly improves the efficiency of CoFeCr LDH/NF in water electrolysis, especially in OER.",

Iridium catalysts promoted TH reactions have been widely studied; however, examples of TH to CO2 are very scarce. In our search for the development of new and more efficient catalysts, we have studied the ability of [IrCp*(QO)X] complexes (QO = 8‐oxyquinolinate) to promote TH to bicarbonate salts and CO2 to obtain formate salts. The study shows a crucial ligand effect, obtaining the best results when [IrCp*(5,7‐Me,Me‐QO)Cl] was employed.

This necessitates the designing of highly active and stable Co‐based electrocatalysts for UOR.

The addition of urea to the alkaline electrolyte as a sacrificial agent significantly reduced the potential required by B@CP for UOR compared to OER for attaining a fixed current density. B@CP achieved the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at potentials of 1.31 V and 1.40 V, respectively. Adding borophene to the catalyst also modified its morphology and charge transport, enhancing the UOR kinetics, reducing the charge transfer resistance, and exposing more electrochemically active sites. Moreover, B@CP displayed long‐term UOR stability for 50 h. This work will encourage the development of innovative strategies for tuning the properties of different transition metal‐based electrocatalysts via borophene for various energy conversion applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA new class of skeleton nickel catalysts with high activity and selectivity in the CO2 methanation reaction has been developed, where magnesium fluoride plays a structure‐forming component. The precursor for the skeleton catalyst is a binary magnesium–nickel fluoride solid solution (MgF2–NiF2), synthesized using the precipitation method from magnesium nitrate, nickel nitrate, and ammonium fluoride. Upon reduction at 500 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere, only nickel fluoride is reduced, while magnesium fluoride maintains its structure unchanged, forming the structural framework for nickel nanoparticles. The catalyst achieves a specific surface area of up to 87.2 m2g−1 and a nickel metal surface area of up to 3.06 m2g−1. The most active catalyst, containing 73.1 wt.% Ni can convert 73% of CO2 to methane, with a selectivity of nearly 98% and a carbon balance of 0.98 at 400 °C, under high GHSV = 20,000 h−1. Among the factors contributing to the high catalytic activity, the metallic surface area measured by hydrogen chemisorption, the content of metallic nickel, and the amount of hydroxyl groups were identified. A strong correlation with catalytic activity was also observed for the surface composition of the catalysts determined by XPS, including: (1) total nickel content, (2) metallic nickel content, (3) oxygen content, and (4) the atomic Ni/Mg ratio. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between the activity and the surface basicity of the catalysts as measured by the CO2‐TPD method.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSulfonic acid group functionalized materials with Brønsted acid sites play a key role in the catalytic conversion of oxygen‐containing compounds with α─O─4 bonds to high‐carbon phenolic compounds. However, it is challenging to generate high‐carbon phenolic compounds with high selectivity due to the limited number of sulfonic acid groups grafted on the carrier and the difficulty in regulating the acid strength. This study utilizes concentrated sulfuric acid to sulfonate poly‐divinylbenzene to obtain sulfonated polymer nanotube catalysts with Brønsted acid sites. Their acid strength was regulated simply by controlling the sulfonation time. The π─π conjugation of the benzene rings in the polymer backbone and the electron‐withdrawing action of sulfonic acid groups alter the electron cloud density of the C─S bond, leading to the dissociation of H+ from sulfonic acid groups. This mechanism facilitates the highly selective alkylation of benzyloxybenzene, yielding bicyclic phenolic compounds, specifically 2‐benzylphenol and 4‐benzylphenol. The optimal material (SPDVB‐14) completely converts benzyloxybenzene into phenolic compounds under mild conditions (140 °C, 0.2 MPa N2, and 1.5 h), achieving a yield of up to 87.5% for both 2‐benzylphenol and 4‐benzylphenol. These high‐carbon phenolic compounds have potential application value in diesel/jet fuel and liquid organic hydrogen carriers.",

Thanks to its bi‐stability, this complex enables the evaluation of its catalytic activity in both the high‐spin (HS) and low‐spin (LS) states under identical experimental conditions, thereby clearly distinguishing the effects of the spin state from other variables. A notable increase in catalytic efficiency is observed from the low‐spin to the high‐spin state, with the high‐spin complex promoting up to 1.7 times more acetal formation. Extensive experiments across multiple batches of the complex confirm that these findings are both reproducible and representative. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we assessed the activation energy of the process. The activation energies for both spin states were found to be comparable, suggesting that the observed difference in catalytic activity is not due to electronic factors that stabilize the transition state, but rather to easier access to the catalytic active sites in the high‐spin state. This work represents a significant advancement toward developing a switchable catalytic system based on spin‐crossover phenomena, highlighting that the catalytic activity of SCO complexes can be effectively tuned by the spin state of the metal.",

The resulting Zn@TFPTA‐BDU COF was obtained. It was characterized by FT‐IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), PXRD (powder X‐ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), EDAX (energy dispersive X‐ray analysis), HR‐TEM (high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy), BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller), and XPS (X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Zn@TFPTA‐BDU COF demonstrates commendable yields (i.e., 54%–88% yields) in CO2 carbonylative coupling reactions, even under mild conditions. On the other hand, this newly synthesized catalyst also showed excellent performance in solvent‐free, room‐temperature oxazolidinones synthesis (with a yield of more than 90%) under sustainable conditions. Additionally, the as‐synthesized microporous COF catalyst demonstrated remarkable durability and can be recycled up to five times without any noticeable loss of its catalytic performance, indicating a true heterogeneous nature, highlighting its reusability, and making it a sustainable and cost‐effective solution.

A urea‐assisted deposition approach was employed to deposit noble metal nanoparticles uniformly on CeO2 without stabilizers, preserving the support's crystallinity and enhancing reducibility through strong metal‐support interactions. Catalytic tests at 550 °C over 24 h revealed significant differences in activity and the products distribution based on the metal used. Rh/CeO2 demonstrated the highest performance, achieving complete ethanol conversion and 37.75% hydrogen production, attributed to its efficient C─C and C─H bond cleavage. Pt/CeO2 and Ru/CeO2 also displayed high activity and stability, whereas Pd/CeO2 and Au/CeO2 primarily produced acetaldehyde due to preferential C─H bond scission. Post‐reaction analysis confirmed minimal carbon deposition across all catalysts, with Rh/CeO2 exhibiting the highest resistance to coke formation.

Combining phosphoric acid doping experiments with catalytic performance tests and several spectroscopic techniques, active sites could be identified. It is shown that the sites consist of coordinatively unsaturated Lewis acid V4+ centers and Brønsted acid P─OH groups that are connected by V─O─P bridging bonds. Phosphorus blocks these sites but does not alter their chemical nature. Catalytic performance tests correlate with spectroscopic results, demonstrating a direct relationship between the proposed active site structure and the catalytic behavior. It is suggested that the active sites exist in the previously identified amorphous surface layer on the crystalline vanadyl pyrophosphate probably formed by VOPO4 species as proposed in the literature. The data show that only about 11% of the catalyst surface is catalytically active, making earlier active site suggestions based on crystallographic considerations of vanadyl pyrophosphate unlikely.

Here we present a one‐pot two‐step cascade reaction in which phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPAD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid, followed by O‐methylation of the intermediate phenolic styrenes by resveratrol O‐methyltransferase from Vitis vinifera (VvROMT).

Characterization of variants with amino acid substitution in the active‐site cavity led to the identification of variants without activity toward the four phenolic acids. This avoids undesired O‐methylation of the starting material, which is not desirable since the decarboxylase does not convert the formed p‐methoxyphenolic acids. Furthermore, variation of amino acids in the active site led to the identification of variants with improved activity for all four phenolic styrenes.

In this work, the self‐supported LIG‐NiCuP electrode, utilizing a porous laser‐induced graphene (LIG) skeleton as the substrate and loaded with NiCuP compound, is designed for the efficient and highly selective electrooxidation of HMF to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The surface reconstruction of electrode forms a LIG‐NiCuP/NiCu(OH)x heterostructure, demonstrating high activity (HMF conversion 99.7%, FDCA yield 92.6%) for HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR). Studies indicate that the low activity of Cu for OER allows it to function as a co‐catalyst, enhancing the selectivity of Ni‐based primary catalyst for HMF. In addition, the pine needle‐like structure introduced by Cu can optimize the morphology of catalyst deposited on the LIG skeleton, increasing the contact area with HMF. On the other hand, from the point view of the substrate to support metal catalysts, the fabrication of LIG combines the characteristics of rapidity, simplicity, scalability, and low cost, therefore, holding high promise in practical applications. Overall, the material system and processing method in this work present a significant step toward developing efficient catalyst electrodes for biomass conversion.",

However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains challenging, with prior methods predominantly accessing N‐side axially chiral variants, while S‐side analogues are scarcely reported. To date, only one approach based on asymmetric Suzuki‐Miyaura cross‐coupling was reported by Tang and co‐workers. We herein report a highly efficient method for the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral biaryl sulfonamides via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis, exploiting readily available aryl iodides, bulky 2‐bromobenzenesulfonamides and olefins as the reactants. This approach demonstrates broad substrate scope, excellent enantioselectivities, step economy, and scalability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIt is well‐established that tailoring the structural properties of nanoparticles, for example, their size, shape, available active surface, and interaction with metal oxide supports, imparts significant control on catalytic transformations. However, this often relies on the use of stabilizing (capping) agents. These capping agents, predominantly long chain, or bulky polymers, are not benign and also influence the catalytic performance. In this study, we expand on the use of surfactant‐controlled reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of furfural on Pd/TiO2. In particular, the presence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the methanol prepared catalysts, shifts product selectivity for furfural hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), resulting from restricted diffusion away from the Pd nanoparticle surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate how solid‐state NMR is able to study the surfactant‐catalyst interaction and how these can be correlated to the selectivity profile for furfural hydrogenation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study aims to investigate the effect of copper (Cu) content in the precursor alloy on the performance of high‐entropy sulfide (HES) electrocatalysts prepared by the hydrothermal method in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Given the unique multi‐metallic structure of high‐entropy sulfides and their potential excellent electrochemical performance, HES electrocatalysts with different Cu contents were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis in this paper, and the effect of Cu content on the catalyst performance was systematically analyzed. The results show that when the molar ratio of Cu to other metals is 0.5, the performance of the corresponding HES electrode in OER is significantly improved. Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, which has a lowest overpotential of 232.54 mV with a Tafel slope of 144.85 mV·dec−1 and excellent stability. The improved performance of the HES electrocatalyst can be attributed to the surface morphology optimization, improved conductivity, and enhanced entropy stability brought about by the adjustment of Cu content. In addition, the synergistic effect between metal elements improves the intrinsic activity and active site exposure of the catalyst, and the uniformity and surface consistency of the catalyst also enhance its stability. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for the preparation and application of HES electrocatalysts but also provides a new path for the development of energy conversion and storage technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZn‐containing ZSM‐5 zeolite is extensively utilized as a catalyst for light hydrocarbons aromatization reactions due to its excellent catalytic performance. Nevertheless, the enduring stable operation of Zn‐modified ZSM‐5 zeolite catalysts faces obstacles posed by carbon deposition and the loss of Zn species during the reaction process. The accumulation of coke on the zeolite catalysts during the aromatization of light hydrocarbons is influenced by the aromatization reaction pathway, the structural attributes of the zeolite (pore channels, acidity), and the evolution of Zn species. The state of Zn species in zeolite catalysts is influenced by the preparation method, reaction atmosphere, and carbon deposition process. The depletion of active Zn species impacts not only the catalytic performance in aromatization but also the stability of the catalysts. In light of this, this paper reviews the reaction pathways of Zn/ZSM‐5 zeolite catalysts for the aromatization of light hydrocarbons, strategies for Zn retention, countermeasures against Zn loss, carbon deposition, and methods to mitigate carbon deposition. Given the current state of research on aromatization catalysts, it is advisable to prioritize the incorporation of anticarbon deposition and anti‐Zn loss attributes in future research and development endeavors. Such an approach holds the promise of yielding highly selective and stable catalysts for light hydrocarbons aromatization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe electrocatalytic oxidation of urea (UOR) at near‐theoretical potentials presents a promising approach for efficient urea energy conversion. A critical challenge lies in enhancing the compatibility between the active sites and the multiple intermediates of UOR to accelerate urea dehydrogenation kinetics, thereby overcoming the high overpotential barrier of urea oxidation. Herein, we propose a strategy to enhance d–p orbital hybridization via bimetallic doping and develop a silver/cobalt (ACO/NS) co‐doped nickel sulfide‐based self‐supporting composite catalyst. The synergistic interaction between the bimetallic oxide and nickel sulfide heterojunction regulates d–p orbital hybridization, redistributes charge, and optimizes the adaptability of the Ni site energy levels to better match urea and various intermediates. This promotes efficient electron coupling and dehydrogenation processes with OH⁻. Experimental results demonstrate that ACO/NS exhibits outstanding urea oxidation activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.04 V (versus RHE) and maintaining stable activity over 168 h. Theoretical analysis combined with experimental findings reveals a microscopic reaction mechanism at low potentials: the enhanced d–p hybridization induced by bimetallic doping modulates the adsorption strength of OH* and urea, thereby accelerating the dehydrogenation kinetics of urea oxidation. This work highlights the feasibility of achieving near‐theoretical potential urea oxidation through the systematic modulation and optimization of catalysts, providing valuable insights for the development of high‐performance catalytic systems.",

Interestingly, an interconnected particle morphology with uniform pores (149.4 ± 70.2 nm) evolved in ammonia tread 3DPE, which was absent in the argon environment‐activated electrode. Also, the enhanced anodic/cathodic ion diffusion coefficient from Ar‐300 (1.26 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) to Am‐300 (1.659 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) signified the active participation of the macropore in the presence of inner redox probe (ferro/ferricyanide). The improved electron transfer rates of 5.36 × 10−4 and 2.79 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 were observed in the Am‐300 and Ar‐300 electrodes, respectively. The activated Am‐300 support electrode showed an OER activation overpotential of 466 mV and 686 mV under N2‐saturated 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The notable activity of the Am‐300 electrodes has been attributed to the combined effect of enhanced electronic conductivity, high density of macro/mesoporosity, and remarkable modulation of the double layer capacitance (Cdl), which enabled higher accessibility of reactant. The electrode activation strategy developed in the present study can provide a simple and scalable approach toward developing a free‐standing electrode and its direct impact on the active site support for the pH‐neutral OER catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA detailed examination of substrate scope is described for alkene hydrophosphination catalyzed by a series of Cp*Ru complexes. An outer‐sphere mechanism is proposed that involves nucleophilic addition of a Ru phosphido ligand to the alkene and subsequent proton transfer to the resulting phospha‐carbanion from Ru‐bound substrate phosphine. Selected kinetic studies and the observation of catalyst resting state complexes that inevitably contain both a reactive phosphido ligand and substrate phosphine suggest that the conjugate addition is turnover limiting. However, analysis of catalyst activities as a function of the alkene activating group, and observation of off‐cycle alkene oligomerization initiated by the phospha‐carbanion intermediate for some alkene and phosphine substrates point to a more complex situation. These results suggest that alkenes that are “too” activated or substrate phosphines that are not sufficiently P─H acidic cause the intramolecular proton transfer to become turnover‐limiting, with rates sensitive to the conjugate addition “pre‐equilibrium”. This unusual compilation of experimental evidence for the impact of substrate variation on the activity and selectivity of a hydrophosphination catalyst provides insights for guiding future catalyst (re)design, including the challenge of providing a coordination environment that enhances phosphine P─H acidity to achieve a broader substrate phosphine scope.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons is essential for the production of alkenes used in polymerization processes. Au‐based catalysts offer greater selectivity than Pd but are limited by poor hydrogen activation. Alloying Au with Cu offers a promising approach to enhance catalytic performance by improving activity while retaining excellent selectivity. The structural dynamics of TiO₂‐supported monometallic (Au, Cu) and bimetallic (AuCu, AuCu3) catalysts were investigated during the reduction step where metal nanoparticles are structured, and the selective hydrogenation of butadiene, using operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). XANES investigation shows that the temperature at which both metal precursors are reduced during the reduction step is strongly influenced by the alloy composition. This is explained by a Au0 assisted reduction of Cu2+ species mediated by H2 spillover. EXAFS shows that Au maintains its metallic state during the catalytic reaction, while Cu shows minor electronic changes without forming segregated CuO phases. EXAFS also indicate a synergistic effect in AuCu/TiO2 catalyst. STEM‐HAADF investigation reveals that the crystalline structure of AuCu nanoparticles after reaction is more robust against size‐dependent structural changes compared to pure Au, suggesting that alloying Cu with Au plays a role in the nanoparticle's stability.",

The present study reports for the first time in detail the direct correlation of catalytic activity in the ethynylation reaction with properties like dispersion and crystallinity of Cu2C2 formed in situ on silica‐supported copper oxide‐based pre‐catalysts during activation. With implemented safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterizations of the explosive Cu2C2 have been accomplished using Raman spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction. Interrelationships of the active phase and catalysis of the Cu/Bi/SiO2 pre‐catalysts could be concluded by varying copper loading (optimum 35 wt.%), bismuth promoter concentration (optimum 4 wt.%), and pre‐catalyst calcination procedure. The formation rate, amount, and dispersion of Cu2C2 determine the reaction rate and yield of BYD, thus bridging the former gap between copper oxide pre‐catalysts and the actual active cuprous acetylide phase.",

With the addition of catalytic amounts of acetic acid, the hydroformylation step proceeded with a 99% yield over both catalysts. The catalysts were recovered and reused, maintaining their activity for three reaction cycles (12 h). The hydroaminomethylation step again gave yields up to 99%, using 1‐hexene as substrate (120 °C, 4 h, 40 bar of N2/H2 1:1).

Herein, we report a simple, easily scalable, one‐pot hydrothermal strategy for the synthesis of nanoscale palladium phosphide (PdP) loaded three‐dimensional nitrogen‐doped graphene (3D‐NrGO/PdP) composites as a potential anode electrocatalyst for formic acid electro‐oxidation (FAEO). The stability and electrocatalytic activity of 3D‐NrGO/PdP are shown to be strongly composition sensitive, with 3D‐NrGO/PdP(2:1) (Pd:P ratio of 2:1) composite exhibiting the highest activity, stability, and tolerance to higher concentrations of formic acid under DFAFCs relevant conditions. The exceptionally high electrochemically active surface area, high electronic conductivity, and positive synergism among the components of optimally composed 3D‐NrGO/PdP(2:1) composite are demonstrated to endow it with excellent electrochemical stability, low resistance to charge transfer, and hence high electrocatalytic performance toward FAEO.

    "abstract": "AbstractNickel phosphide nanoparticles are used as catalysts in a wide range of chemical transformations such as hydrogenation. However, the synthesis of colloidal dispersion of these nanoparticles usually requires high reaction temperature and oleylamine as a reducing agent, which compromises the surface reactivity of the nanocatalysts. This work reports a robust new method of the synthesis of nickel phosphide nanoparticles assisted by H2 and at a lower temperature of 200 °C. Well‐crystallized Ni12P5 and Ni2P nanoparticles of 5.5 ± 0.5 nm were successfully prepared using tri‐n‐octylphosphine (TOP) as the phosphorus source. They were characterized by X‐ray diffraction and high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy. A higher temperature, reaction time, and TOP/Ni ratio favored the formation of a Ni2P phase over Ni12P5.These nanoparticles were used as catalysts for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. At high temperatures (80 and 100 °C), they allowed the full conversion of phenylacetylene to ethylbenzene. Interestingly, they were also active in the lower temperature regime, at 30 °C or even 0 °C, where significant conversions were obtained as soon as at least 0.1 equiv of tri‐n‐butylphopshine was added as a co‐catalyst, and styrene was the major product. The activity of this nanocatalyst in the low‐temperature regime outperformed that reported for other nickel phosphide nanoparticles with similar size, but prepared in the presence of oleylamine. This work highlights the relevance of H2‐assisted synthesis for the production of nanocatalysts active at temperatures below 30 °C.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOwing to the abundance of seawater, hydrogen production via direct seawater electrolysis is a promising technology for sustainable energy production. However, the construction of efficient and durable catalysts and their application in seawater electrolysis remains a considerable challenge. Here, the precursor of NiFe‐based Prussian blue analogs (NiFe PBA) was synthesized in situ on a corrosion‐resistant nickel sulfide substrate, followed by phosphating to successfully preparing a core‐shell transition metal phosphide/sulfide (Ni3S2@CoFe‐P) catalyst. The prepared Ni3S2@CoFe‐P catalyst obtained overpotentials of 75 and 153 mV in alkaline (1 M KOH) and alkaline seawater (1 M KOH + seawater) at 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The excellent HER performance of the catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect between the heterogeneous interfaces of Ni3S2@CoFe‐P, which can effectively optimize the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst and accelerate the electron transfer. Meanwhile, the core‐shell structure exposes abundant active sites. In addition, the Ni3S2@CoFe‐P catalyst was able to operate smoothly in seawater for 100 h due to the inherent corrosion resistance of metal phosphides. This work offers a viable approach to design high‐performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.",

The materials were calcined and reduced to evaluate their catalytic performance in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin, a representative lignin‐derived compound. Catalytic tests performed in a batch reactor at 533 K and 3.92 MPa H₂ demonstrated that the Ni/Al = 3 catalyst exhibited superior activity, achieving full vanillin conversion and 79% selectivity toward fully deoxygenated products, namely methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane. Characterization by XRD, TPR, and XPS revealed that the coexistence of metallic Ni⁰ particles and oxygen vacancies was critical in enhancing both hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions. Notably, the presence of anionic vacancies allowed for heterolytic H₂ dissociation and hydride formation, contributing to high catalytic efficiency even in the absence of surface‐exposed Ni⁰. The Ni–Al interaction modulated the electronic environment and reducibility of the active sites, influencing product selectivity and catalytic stability. Recycling experiments confirmed the catalyst’s structural robustness over three consecutive cycles. This study demonstrates that tuning the Ni/Al ratio in LDH‐derived mixed oxides enables the design of stable and bifunctional catalysts with synergistic active sites, offering a promising strategy for efficient bio‐oil upgrading via selective HDO pathways.",

We have exemplified this approach with the catalytic propane combustion, CO oxidation, HCl oxidation, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the latter reaction representing the bottleneck in water electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources. For the incorporation of hydrogen into mixed oxides (hydrogen promotion), a specific design strategy is proposed: the mixed oxide (solid solution) consists of one metal oxide that is capable of activating H2 dissociation and a second component that stabilizes the mixed oxide against chemical reduction upon exposure to H2 at temperatures of 150–250 °C. To date this concept has been successfully demonstrated for solid solutions with rutile structure (RuxTi1‐xO2 and IrxTi1‐xO2). Hydrogen promotion of mixed oxides is expected to be useful in hydrogenation catalysis as well. Other mixed oxide systems in which hydrogen promotion is observed remain to be discovered. Hydrogenation of catalysts is so simple that it should be included in routine screening protocols of oxidation catalysts.",

We present a straightforward method for achieving high-concentration and long-term stable graphene suspensions by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) via a combination of ammonia (NH3) as an easily removable additive together with low-boiling point, benign organic-water co-solvent mixtures as suspension media. We find that the addition of small amounts of NH3 as an additive drastically improves the obtainable LPE graphene concentrations by up to 2 orders of magnitude for a wide range of organic-water co-solvent mixtures including with isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone, ethylene glycol and tert-butanol. With our approach we readily reach current benchmark graphene concentration values of ~180 mg·L-1 that are normally only obtainable using hard-to-remove high-boiling-point and hazardous standard solvents like dimethylformamide and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolydone or with hard-to-remove surfactants. Notably, NH3 as an additive is highly volatile and thus, as we show, easily removable without degrading the produced high quality graphene nanosheets.",

RNA molecules are encapsulated within their interior through electrostatic interactions with positively charged lipids. The identity of the lipids that present at their surface play a role in how they interact with and are perceived by the body and their resultant potency. Here, we use a model formulation to develop cryogenic sample preparation for molecular depth profiling Orbitrap secondary ion mass spectrometry (Cryo-OrbiSIMS) preceded by morphological characterisation using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). It is found that the depth distribution of individual lipid components is revealed relative to the surface and the RNA cargo defining the core. A preferential lipid orientation can be determined for the 1,2-Dimyristoyl-glycero-3-methox-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DMG-PEG2k) molecule, by comparing the profiles of PEG to DMG fragments. PEG fragments are found immediately during analysis of the LNP surface, while the DMG fragments are deeper, coincident with RNA ions located in the core, in agreement with established models of LNPs. This laboratory-based de novo analysis technique requires no labelling, providing advantages over large facility neutron scattering characterisation.",

Its activity can be controlled by ligands offering access to pharmacological Nurr1 modulation. However, the binding epitope(s) and molecular activation mechanisms of synthetic Nurr1 activators remained elusive but are essential to advance Nurr1 ligands towards new medicines. Here we characterized Nurr1 dimer dissociation and coregulator release as molecular contributions to Nurr1 activation by vidofludimus and locate its binding in an allosteric surface pocket lined by helices 1, 5, 7, and 8 by mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation. Structure-guided ligand design using these insights resulted in an optimized Nurr1 agonist with substantially enhanced potency and binding affinity. Our results provide a structural and molecular basis for Nurr1 activation by a synthetic agonist which was lacking for rational ligand design.",

CrI3, a layered ferromagnetic insulator, has gained significant attention as the first stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, sparking interest in two-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we report the synthesis of high-quality, monolayer CrI3 nanotubes encapsulated within multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), ranging from 2 to 10 nm with an average diameter of 5.3 nm, as well as a smaller amount of CrI3 nanorods. Through aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we explored the fundamental physics and magnetism of these 1D van der Waals heterostructures. These findings pave the way towards the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states in tubular geometries, driven by the interplay of magnetic anisotropy and curvature.",

We reveal that continuous-wave laser irradiation yields single crystals of the metastable polymorph, whereas continued irradiation with high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser pulses induces poly-crystallization of the stable form. Crucially, by strategically alternating between these two laser modalities during crystal growth, we can open up new crystallization pathways, including the single crystal growth of the stable phase.

We report that α-iminol rearrangements could be strategically redirected by the interception of Petasis reactions, in the context of being avoided by strong electron-withdrawing groups on the migrative aryl units. 1,4-Aryl migration prevails over 1,2-aryl migration via forming a boron-ate complex. By leveraging this reactivity, we developed a regiospecific synthesis of unsymmetrically 2,3-diaryl substituted indoles from three readily available feedstocks: an amine, an arylglyoxal, and a boronic acid. While traditional Petasis reactions with similar three-component inputs are typically applied to build C(sp3)-C(sp2) and C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds, the present transformation offers a special opportunity for constructing a C(sp2)-C(sp2) linkage. Highly substituted indole motifs with structural diversity in the C2 position are easily accessed by this three-component reaction. A mechanism containing a copper-cobalt collaborative promotion process was suggested.",

Despite its significance, the mechanisms influencing ICD in molecular complexes remain unclear. Here, we investigate and unambiguously prove the ICD process in thiophene dimer, an aromatic ring with a third-row atom. Using multi-particle momentum coincidence spectroscopy, accompanied by high-level electronic structure calculations, we elucidate that the ICD process is initiated from the sulfur-containing inner-valence orbitals which are energetically below the Auger threshold. This leads to an enhancement in the emission of low-energy ICD electrons compared to other aromatic ring dimers. By utilizing this ‘ICD-only decay’ contribution we quantify ICD probabilities above the Auger threshold. This study reveals the pivotal role of sulfur in shaping the ICD electron spectrum, which can be implied to control the low-energy electron emission in biological systems.",

This approach combines experimental hypotheses with mathematical and physical models, enabling a concise description of complex system dynamics and the extraction of kinetic parameters like kinetic pathways, time constants, and species amplitudes. However, building the final kinetic model requires several intermediate steps, including testing various assumptions and models across multiple experiments. In complex cases, some intermediate states may be unknown and are often simplified. This approach requires expertise in modeling and data comprehension, as poor decisions at any stage during data analysis can lead to an incorrect kinetic model, resulting in inaccurate results. Here, we introduce DLRN, a new deep learning-based framework, designed to rapidly provide a kinetic reaction network, time constants, and amplitude for the system, with comparable performance and, in part, even better than a classical fitting analysis. We demonstrate DLRN’s utility in analyzing multiple timescales datasets with complex kinetics, different 2D systems such as time-resolved spectra and agarose gel electrophoresis data, experimental datasets as nitrogen vacancy and strand displacement circuit (using photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques), even in scenarios where the initial state is a hidden, non-emitting dark state.",

Herein, we engineered an OER electrode from abundant stainless steel (SS) via facile approaches, and the obtained electrode consists of a Ni-rich oxide surface layer with a Fe-rich metal substrate. An outstanding activity was observed with an overpotential of 316 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, an electrode self-replenishing concept is proposed in which a Ni-rich catalyst layer can be regenerated from a metallic substrate due to the difference in diffusion and dissolution rates of metal oxides/hydroxides, and this regeneration is validated by various characterizations. A recorded degradation rate of 0.012 was observed at 1000 mA cm−2 for 1000 h. The facile engineering of OER electrodes from SS combined with the self-replenishing catalyst can potentially address the cost, activity, and long-term stability barriers.",

We performed multimodal (fluorescence, lipid ion, and topographic) imaging of two types of HeLa cells labeled with fluorescent dyes and chemically fixed and showed the potential for subcellular-scale analysis of both cell structure and chemical composition. Furthermore, we evaluated the lipid species by comparing the SC-MSI results with those of supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

In this study, we demonstrated the OAD MS/MS technique in the negative-ion mode for profiling phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, and sulfatides, where the fragmentation mechanism remained consistent with that in the positive ion mode. Furthermore, we proposed optimal conditions for the simultaneous acquisition of CID- and OAD-specific fragment ions, termed OAciD, where oxygen atoms and hydroxy radicals facilitate C=C position-specific fragmentation, while residual water vapor induces cleavage of low-energy covalent bonds as observed in CID. Finally, theoretical fragment ions were implemented in MS-DIAL 5 to accelerate C=C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics. The OAciD methodology was used to illuminate brain region-specific marmoset lipidomes with C=C positional information, including the estimation of C=C positional isomer ratios. We also characterized the profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids, finding that lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids were enriched in the cerebellum, whereas those containing omega-6 fatty acids were more abundant in the hippocampus and frontal lobe.",

While NOS linkages in proteins were once assumed to occur only between lysine and cysteine, our investigation shows that these bonds extend beyond the well–studied lysine-NOS-cysteine examples. By systematically analyzing over 86,000 high–resolution X-ray protein structures, we uncovered 69 additional NOS bonds, including arginine-NOS-cysteine and glycine-NOS-cysteine. Our pipeline integrates machine learning, quantum–mechanical calculations, and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data to systematically detect these subtle covalent interactions and identify key predictive descriptors for their formation. The discovery of these previously unrecognized linkages broadens the scope of protein chemistry and may enable targeted modulation in drug design and protein engineering. Although our study focuses on NOS linkages, the flexibility of this methodology allows for the investigation of a wide range of chemical bonds and covalent modifications, including structurally resolvable posttranslational modifications (PTMs). By revisiting and re-examining well-established protein models, this work underscores how systematic data-driven approaches can uncover hidden aspects of protein chemistry and inspire deeper insights into protein function and stability.",

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL), generated from tryptic digestion of 42 human recombinant proteins, in enhancing the detection and quantification of lower-abundance cancer-associated proteins. Additionally, we generated a combined sample-specific biological-rPSL by integrating the rPSL with a spectral library derived from pooled biological samples. We compared the performance of these libraries for DIA data extraction with standard methods, including sample-specific biological spectral library and library-free DIA methods. Our specific focus was on quantifying cancer-associated proteins, including key enzymes involved in kynurenine pathway, across patient-derived tissues and cell lines. Both rPSL and biological-rPSL-DIA approaches provided significantly improved coverage of lower-abundance proteins, enhancing sensitivity and more consistent protein quantification across matched tumour and adjacent noncancerous tissues from breast and colorectal cancer patients and in cancer cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that rPSL and biological-rPSL coupled with DIA-MS workflows, can address the limitations of both biological library-based and library-free DIA methods, offering a robust approach for quantifying low-abundance cancer-associated proteins in complex biological samples.",

This paper describes experimental data and a prediction model for challenging CCS prediction tasks including longer peptides that tend to have higher charge states. The proposed model is based on a pretrained deep protein language model. While the conventional prediction model requires training from scratch, the proposed model enables training with less amount of time owing to the use of the pretrained model as a feature extractor. Results of experiments with the novel experimental data show that the proposed model succeeds in drastically reducing the training time while maintaining the same or even better prediction performance compared with the conventional method. Our approach presents the possibility of prediction on the basis of \"greener\" manner training of various peptide properties in proteomic liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry experiments.",

By cultivating the producer strain, Actinokineospora auranticolor DSM 44650, an antibiotic complex-named kineomicins (Kmc)-was identified and characterized by microbiological assays, LC-MS, and MS/MS analyses. A comprehensive model for Kmc biosynthesis was then proposed by a thorough investigation of kineomicin BGC (knm). The structure of the main complex congener (KmcB), resolved by NMR spectroscopy, proved to be unique. Finally, the remarkably high antibiotic production rate, up to >1 g L-1 Kmc in benchtop bioreactor, indicated A. auranticolor as a natural GPA overproducer, holding promise as a potential host for heterologous expression of GPA BGCs.",

As the level of molecular crowding varies spatio-temporally in cells, it would be beneficial to predict the behaviour of DNA and RNA structures depending on the local cellular environments. This has applications in human mitochondria, which possess an especially crowded condition. In this study, the predictability of guanine-quadruplex (G4) DNA formation in the environment specific to human mitochondria was investigated. In accordance with the stability of duplexes predicted by our nearest-neighbour parameters, the G-rich duplex stability was found to effectively decrease and G4 formation was induced in mitochondrion-like conditions compared to the nucleus-like conditions. Using a peptide-based mitochondrial targeting system, a G4 reporter assay performed in mitochondria indicated that G4 formation were more favoured in mitochondria more than in the nucleus. These findings provide insights useful for the prediction of the behaviour of nucleic acids in mitochondria.",

A mononuclear complex, [Nd(L)(NO3)3] (1Nd), where L is a macrocyclic ligand, was synthesized and used as a precursor to develop two novel species: a dinuclear, [(Nd(L)(NO3))2(µ-BDC)](NO3)2·H2O (2Nd), linked by 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC), and a hexameric, [(Nd(L))(µ-BTC)(H2O)]6·35H2O (6Nd), linked with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC). Thermometric properties were studied in the physiological temperature range (292-332 K), utilizing 804 nm laser excitation (first biological window) and monitoring emissions in the second biological window (908, 1065, and 1340 nm) associated with the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, 4I11/2, 4I13/2 transitions, respectively. Among the complexes, the hexamer 6Nd exhibited exceptional performance, with Sr of 2.4%K-1 at 293 K, when luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) of two Stark components of the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 emission was used, positioning it as a high-performance NdIII-based thermometer. All complexes displayed anti-thermal quenching behavior, surpassing the current molecular-based thermometers in the near-infrared region. Theoretical calculations using complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF) and Boltzmann population models between Kramers doublets of the 4F3/2 level were performed to rationalize the anti-thermal behavior.",

In the context of superconductivity and topological phenomena related to band inversion, intermetallic compounds of bismuth have come into focus recently. While bismuth forms a rich variety of Zintl phases with the heavier alkaline-earth metals, there are significantly fewer magnesium compounds. Here we show that high-temperature high-pressure synthesis opens a convenient route for the preparation of Mg5Bi3Hx already at moderate conditions. The compound (space group Pnma, a = 11.5399(3) Å, b = 8.9503(2) Å and c = 7.8770(2) Å) adopts a Ca5Sb3F crystal structure. The minute amounts of hydrogen could only be detected by thermal decomposition of the compound in combination with mass spectroscopy of the gas phase. Direct space analysis of the chemical bonding allowed for allocating the hydrogen position at a partially occupied interstitial site and reveals strongly polar Mg-Bi and Mg-H bonds in accordance with the Zintl concept. Calculated band structures exhibit substantial electronic reorganization upon hydrogen insertion. The combination of advanced analytical tools in concert with modern quantum chemical techniques provides an efficient approach to allocate trace amounts of interstitial atoms stabilizing intermetallic phases.",

In AD mouse models, microglial expression of apoE3 reduces amyloid plaque burden through enhanced phagocytosis, whereas apoE4 is associated with impaired Aβ clearance. However, the isoform-specific interactions of apoE with Aβ aggregates and the molecular mechanisms by which these isoforms influence Aβ aggregation and clearance remain poorly understood, which is critical for developing potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we employed TIRFM, superresolution microscopy, and single-molecule photobleaching techniques to investigate the isoform-specific effects of apoE on the rate constants of Aβ42 aggregation at the single-fibril level, as well as to quantify the binding affinity and specificity of apoE isoforms to individual Aβ fibril ends. Our results show that apoE4 is ca. 4-5 times less effective than apoE3 and apoE2 in inhibiting fibril elongation, while secondary nucleation is largely unaffected by any of the isoforms. Furthermore, apoE3 exhibits stronger and more specific binding to fibril ends compared to apoE4. These findings suggest that apoE4's reduced affinity for growing fibril ends may impair microglial clearance and increase amyloid deposition through a higher elongation rate in the brain of ApoE-ε4 carriers.",

Obtaining structural information about the intermediate states of Aβ-membrane systems and their molecular interactions is challenging due to their heterogeneity and low abundance. Here, we systematically study the molecular interactions of membrane-associated Aβ1-42 peptides using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, focusing on the primary nucleation phase of the fibrillation process. Compared to the less pathogenic Aβ1-40 peptide, Aβ1-42 forms smaller oligomers prior to fibrillation, as evidenced by a higher overall population of lipid-proximity peptides. Aβ1-42 also exhibits more pronounced residue-specific contacts with phospholipid headgroups compared to Aβ1-40, with multiple lipid-proximity segments throughout the entire primary sequence. The segments involved in initial inter-strand assembly overlap with those located near the lipid headgroups in Aβ1-42, whereas these two segments are distinct in Aβ1-40. ssNMR spectroscopy with sensitivity enhanced by Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) confirmed local secondary structural convergence during the nucleation process of Aβ1-42 and the presence of long-range tertiary contacts at early stages of nucleation. Overall, our results provide a molecular-level understanding of the Aβ1-42 nucleation process in a membrane-like environment and its membrane-disrupting intermediates. The comparison between Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 explains its higher cytotoxicity from the perspective of membrane disruption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Chemocommunication is important in human nonverbal communication. Behavioral effects of anxiety chemosignals on recipients are established but it is unknown whether odor sensitivity can be modulated by such stimuli. We tested recipients’ sensitivity to phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) and n-butanol after exposure to anxiety chemosignals, neutral chemosignals and blank condition. As fourth condition, a horror movie was shown, to compare the effects of visual stimuli and chemosignals on odor sensitivity. Odor sensitivity for PEA was significantly increased by anxiety chemosignals compared to blank condition. No change in odor sensitivity was evident for n-butanol. We also investigated the composition of the applied chemosensory stimuli using untargeted one-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and -olfactometry (GC-O). Considering GC-MS data, several compounds were found with significantly higher normalized peak areas in anxiety sweat samples compared to the neutral samples. GC-O analysis indicated that the carboxylic acids dodecanoic acid and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid were potential main contributors to the odor of anxiety sweat samples, whereby tetradecanoic acid and patchouli alcohol were those of the odor of neutral sweat samples. This study provides evidence that anxiety chemosignals can improve odor sensitivity and constitutes a further step toward elucidating the composition of sweat samples used in chemical communication research.",

However, achieving stable cycling performance, particularly at high mass-loadings and elevated temperatures, remains a challenge. The stable cycling of high mass-loading sodium-ion battery cells is here made possible by addition of prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone (PES) to a non-flammable and fluorine-free electrolyte solution of sodium bis(oxalato)borate (NaBOB) salt in triethyl phosphate (TEP). This study investigates the thermal stability and electrochemical performance of such electrolyte at 40 °C and 55 °C, contrasting their performance with base NaBOB in TEP with and without ethylene sulfate (DTD) additive and with a reference carbonate electrolyte of NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate:diethylene carbonate (EC:DEC). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy was used to reveal degradation products formed in the electrolyte following a 4-weeks storage at 55 °C. Results from galvanostatic cycling at 55 °C demonstrated comparable performance of NaBOB–TEP + PES electrolyte and the reference carbonate electrolyte. The internal cell resistance was initially lower when cells were cycled at 55 °C than at 40 °C for all studied electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "TDP-43, a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein consisting of 414 residues, forms self-association in the nucleus for physiological gene regulation, while aggregation into amyloid (consisting of aberrant β-sheets) in the cytoplasm causes neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Post-translational phosphorylation of TDP-43 alters the self-association properties, which affects both the physiological function in the nucleus and the amyloidogenic potential in the cytoplasm, thereby impacting upon disease progression. However, insight into the role of per-residue phosphorylation in the self-association remains limited due to the difficulty in obtaining site-specifically phosphorylated TDP-43. Here, we demonstrate semi-synthesis of full-length TDP-43 that is uniformly phosphorylated at the 48th serine residue (designated as TDP1-414[pS48]). The synthetic scheme consisting of native chemical ligation followed by His-tag affinity chromatography efficiently gave TDP1-414(pS48) with a high purity. Interestingly, unlike non-phosphorylated TDP-43, the phosphorylated TDP-43 was found to have weak self-association property and to form aggregates that were not typical amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, chemical synthesis and three-dimensional structure analysis of the N-terminal domain (NTD, corresponding to TDP1-80) suggested that the phosphate ion at Ser48 weakens the inter-NTD interaction by inducing electrostatic repulsion. It significantly advances understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved in the post-translational modifications of TDP-43 associated with the neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Long-lived triplet exciton harvesting materials are of immense interest for applications in bioimaging, optoelectronics, anticounterfeiting, and sensing. However, achieving persistent room-temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) in metal-free systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present purely organic axially chiral aminoboranes (R/S-(BN)₂) with enhanced pRTP properties and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). By introducing axial chirality, the dual-core (R/S-(BN)₂) system achieves steric-hindrance-caused rigidity, which restricts molecular motions, leading to superior phosphorescence properties. Notably, R-(BN)₂ demonstrates a phosphorescence quantum yield (ΦP) of 9.2% (S-(BN)₂ : ΦP = 8.7%) and an extended lifetime of 0.9 sec at room temperature, significantly outperforming its mono-core counterpart (BN)₁ (ΦP = 3.0% and τP = 0.6 s). Theoretical analysis corroborates the observed improvements, revealing the synergistic role of borylation and axial chirality in stabilizing triplet states. Furthermore, the axially chiral aminoboranes exhibited CPL in dichloromethane solutions with a dissymmetry factor of ~10-3. These findings highlight the potential of axially chiral frameworks in designing efficient metal-free pRTP materials, as demonstrated in the security writing application, further paving the way for their use in bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting technologies, and next-generation organic electronics.",

Useful chromophores for photothermal therapy (PTT), such as nanoconfined oligomers and polymers, should not only display an excellent light-to-heat efficiency, but in addition must display biocompatibility and good water-solubility. We in this study have designed water-dispersible, nanocaged polypyrroles (PPy), embedded into single-chain nanoparticles (SCNP, sized 6.8 – 8.9 nm) displaying thermoresponsivity, so reaching largely increased PTT-effects. Such encaged PPy-SCNPs allow an efficient photothermal heat conversion reaching temperatures up to 85°C. In a parallelized 96-well-plate-design the PPy-SCNPs can effect an almost complete death of illuminated (cancer) cells at already low concentrations (0.001 mg/mL) with low radiant fluxes. The thermoresponsivity of the SCNPs, surrounding the PPy-chains, then responds to the photothermal heat, so creating a unique self-amplifying effect for photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging.",

    "abstract": "Solid electrolytes (SEs) typically consist of a static framework of anions (FA) and a sublattice of mobile cations (M), with non-covalent dispersion interactions (Edisp) playing a key role in structural stability. However, the impact of these interactions on M-ion migration-whether they assist or hinder it-remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the diffusion barriers of M-ions in SE frameworks, focusing on the M2B12H12 family (M = Li, Na, K), and clarify the role of non-covalent interactions. Our computational analyses reveal that moving from Li to Na to K analogues in M2B12H12 results in significant changes in many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions. The MBD interactions act as springs embedded within the M2B12H12 framework, regulating the effective coordination number (ECN) of M-ions and shaping the potential energy landscape for their migration. A linear correlation is observed between ECN and Edisp, consistent across different alkali ions. This correlation reveals a unified mechanism in which dispersion interactions regulate M-ion migration barrier and identifies a critical bottleneck for beyond-Li diffusion in M2B12H12 SEs. Intriguingly, MBD interactions further influence the prefactor in the diffusivity equation, driving anomalous diffusion behavior in SEs.",

Among the resistance mechanisms, that mediated by metallo-β-lactamases is of particular concern as these bacterial enzymes dismantle most β-lactam antibiotics, which are our widest applied and cheapest to produce antibiotic agents. So far, no clinically applicable metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors are available. Aiming to adapt to structural variations, we introduce the inhibitor concept: dynamically chiral phosphonic acids. We demonstrate that they are straightforward to synthesize, penetrate bacterial membranes, inhibit the metallo-β-lactamase enzymes NDM-1, VIM-2 and GIM-1, and are non-toxic to human cells. Mimicking the transition state of β-lactam hydrolysis, they target the Zn ions of the metallo-β-lactamase active site. As a unique feature, both of their stereoisomers bind metallo-β-lactamases, which provides them unparalleled adaptability to the structural diversity of these enzymes, and may allow them to hamper bacteria’s ability for resistance development.",

Transition-metal metallocenes, such as nickelocene (NiCp2), offer intriguing opportunities due to their well-defined electronic and magnetic properties, making them ideal candidates for studying surface interactions at the atomic level. We investigate the adsorption and transformation of NiCp2, a nickel atom coordinated by two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings, on a Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At low temperatures, NiCp2 preferentially adsorbs at herringbone elbows and step edges, forming ordered assemblies. Upon heating, NiCp2 molecules dissociate into NiCp complexes and Cp radicals. The NiCp fragments self-assemble into one-dimensional chains, which further arrange into triangular structures due to the underlying Au(111) substrate, while Cp radicals exhibit low diffusion barriers on the surface. The dissociated NiCp fragments are non-magnetic, contrasting with the magnetic properties of intact NiCp2 molecules. The formation of one type of dimer of the NiCp fragment is rendered possible by the stabilization granted by gold atoms. This study highlights the controlled formation and assembly of surface-confined nanostructures via temperature-driven molecular dissociation.",

    "abstract": "Ionizable lipids are essential components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for efficient mRNA delivery. However, designing them for high protein expression, endosomal escape, and organ targeting is challenging due to complex structure-activity relationships. Here, we present a high-throughput platform for screening ionizable lipids using a two-step, scalable, one-pot reaction. This enabled the synthesis and vivo screening of 91 new lipids, followed by a structure-activity study, leading to the development of CP-LC-0729, which significantly surpasses the MC3 benchmark in protein expression with preliminary studies showing no in vivo toxicity. Additionally, a one-step strategy helped to yield a permanently cationic lipid which was tested in a fifth-lipid formulation, showing a highly selective lung delivery with a 32-fold increase in protein expression in vivo, outperforming current endogenous targeting strategies. All these findings underscore the potential of lipid CP-LC-0729 and our lipid platform in advancing the efficiency and specificity of mRNA delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Self-healing is a fundamental ability inherent in humans, plants, and other living organisms. To date, a variety of materials with self-healing properties have been developed. However, these materials usually require external inputs such as electric potentials or healing agents to initiate or promote self-healing reactions. Herein, we present a novel self-healing mechanism that operates without any external input, utilizing the dynamic equilibrium between the solid-state and dissolved materials. We employed organic–inorganic perovskites to validate our strategy. Single-particle spectroscopy and imaging demonstrated the spontaneous self-healing of perovskites after photodamage under dynamic equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, we found that perovskites can generate hydrogen in both healed and damaged states. Remarkably, the perovskites exhibited hydrogen generation over four cycles of photodamage and self-healing. The proposed concept and experimental results provide valuable insights for the development of energy conversion and storage systems with improved long-term durability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The field of epitranscriptomics is undergoing a technology-driven revolution. During past decades, RNA modifications like N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine (ψ), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) became acknowledged for playing critical roles in cellular processes. Direct RNA sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) enabled the detection of modifications in native RNA, by detecting noncanonical RNA nucleosides properties in raw data. Consequently, the field’s cutting edge has a heavy component in computer science, opening new avenues of cooperation across the community, as exchanging data is as impactful as exchanging samples. Therefore, we seize the occasion to bring scientists together within the RNA Modification and Processing (RMaP) challenge to advance solutions for RNA modification detection and discuss ideas, problems and approaches. We show several computational methods to detect the most researched mRNA modifications (m6A, ψ, and m5C). Results demonstrate that a low prediction error and a high prediction accuracy can be achieved on these modifications across different approaches and algorithms. The RMaP challenge marks a substantial step towards improving algorithms’ comparability, reliability, and consistency in RNA modification prediction. It points out the deficits in this young field that need to be addressed in further challenges.",

Here, we introduce ChemLM, a transformer language model for this task. ChemLM leverages self-supervised domain adaptation on chemical molecules to enhance its predictive performance. Within the framework of ChemLM, chemical compounds are conceptualized as sentences composed of distinct chemical ‘words’, which are employed for training a specialized chemical language model. On the standard benchmark datasets, ChemLM either matched or surpassed the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of ChemLM in identifying highly potent pathoblockers targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), a pathogen that has shown an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains and has been identified as a critical priority for the development of new medications. ChemLM demonstrated substantially higher accuracy in identifying highly potent pathoblockers against PA when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. An intrinsic evaluation demonstrated the consistency of the chemical language model’s representation concerning chemical properties. The results from benchmarking, experimental data and intrinsic analysis of the ChemLM space confirm the wide applicability of ChemLM for enhancing molecular property prediction within the chemical domain.",

Gold Teaching and learning methods Undergraduates We can all remember back to our first forays into research. It was a process filled with wonder and confusion as we departed from the safe territory of problems with known solutions to the unknown world of asking (and trying to answer) entirely new questions. The experience was both empowering, showing us all the knowledge we have gained throughout our education, and deeply humbling as we struggled to apply this knowledge in different ways.One of the biggest challenges that new researchers face is the gap between the textbook level understanding they have gained in their coursework and the ways that these topics are pursued in cutting edge research in the field. This gap has undoubtedly always existed as no textbook can be entirely comprehensive or eternally up to date, but we have the sense that this gap has been widening in recent years. The gap is certainly large in interdisciplinary fields, where traditional courses or even entire study programs will not cover the range of topics required to be proficient in the field. But it seems that the gap is also widening in traditional disciplines as the publish or perish culture that has pervaded academia preferentially rewards output of top-level research articles over undergraduate textbooks.From the educational side, we can see the problem being addressed with an increasing shift toward research-based teaching, but we can also see that research-based teaching can and should be supported by a different style of publication tailored to these emerging researchers. Be they newly embarked on their research career or established researchers moving into new domains, all will benefit from a practical and pedagogical introduction to important topics for cutting edge research. We have seen the incredible appetite for these types of papers in the community with tutorials and user guides that have been published in recent years, (1−4) and this has encouraged us to officially highlight this type of publication with a new amendment to our information for authors across the nine ACS Au journals.In the short term, we offer a new type of publication, the \"Tutorial\", that we hope will help fill this gap in the literature. In the long term, we imagine collections of these tutorials that might provide a new way to effectively update textbooks, one chapter at a time.While the form and focus of an effective tutorial can vary significantly, we can suggest some guiding principles for authors embarking on this endeavor.Choosing a TopicClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The scope of a tutorial can either be relatively broad, e.g., an emerging field, or quite narrow, e.g., focused on a particular technique. A guiding principle is that it is a pedagogical introduction for a new reader in the area, providing information that cannot be found in a textbook or a research paper. Conceptual, Theoretical or PracticalA tutorial can encompass any and all of the aspects that are useful to bring a new reader into the field. In some instances, these can be important concepts that are difficult to draw out of the literature; in others, a theoretical description; and in many cases, a focus on practical execution, the how-to aspects of learning a new area. Feel free to use both the main text and the Supporting Information to educate the reader in how-to best practice. FAIR Data and CodeIn all cases, we strongly recommend making code and data available in association with the tutorial so that readers can immediately test play with the concept they are learning.We hope that both our readers and authors will enthusiastically embrace this change. It gives authors the opportunity to write the paper they wish they had been given when they entered the field and the paper they can and will hand out to prospective group members and use in their teaching to provide a gentler introduction to the world of their research. For our readers, we hope these papers will bridge the gap between the knowledge you already have and the research you want to do. Part of the privilege of being an open access journal is that we know these papers can reach readers, regardless of their circumstances, and we hope that we can provide a resource to inspire researchers wherever they are.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorGemma C.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical investigation involving electron collisions with cyanoacetylene is reported. Differential cross sections (DCSs), integral cross sections (ICSs), and momentum-transfer cross sections (MTCSs) for the elastic electron scattering were calculated using the Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method at the static-exchange plus polarization (SEP) level of approximation for energies ranging from 0.5 to 30 eV. The Schwinger variational method combined with Padé's approximants (SVPA), considering static-exchange-polarization plus absorption (SEPA), was also applied for impact energies from 0.1 to 1000 eV. These results were complemented by calculations performed according to the screen-corrected independent atom model (SCIAM). Furthermore, original measurements of absolute elastic (DCSs) at 20 eV were conducted in a crossed-beam apparatus. The theoretical results display an outstanding agreement with each other and an overall agreement with the calculated cross sections available in the literature. The agreement between the calculated and measured results is quite encouraging, further validating the thoroughness of the current research.",

ACS PublicationsPublished 2025 by American Chemical SocietySubjectswhat are subjectsArticle subjects are automatically applied from the ACS Subject Taxonomy and describe the scientific concepts and themes of the article.Chemistry educationGoldMaterialsPolymersUndergraduatesFor the last five years, ACS Publications has offered authors the ability to publish in two families of journals, our long-established family of journals that is available to readers through subscription as well as a newer family of open access (OA) journals where all published work is freely available to readers across the world. As part of the latter family of journals, the ACS Au open access journals were launched in 2021, greatly expanding ACS Publications' first forays into open access publishing that started with the launch of ACS Central Science (2015) and ACS Omega (2016). The ACS Au family of journals includes a large, selective multidisciplinary chemistry journal, JACS Au, serving as a companion to the flagship Journal of the American Chemical Society, and nine fully open access community focused journals covering the breadth of the chemical, biochemical, materials, environmental, and engineering disciplines.The launch of the ACS Au journal family further emphasizes ACS' commitment to supporting authors who choose, or are required by their funder, to publish in fully open access journals. As open access mandates continue to evolve around the world, we have continuously sought to provide authors with the options they need to publish their work in journals that feature high scientific rigor, thorough peer review, global impact and reach, and timely editorial decisions. Five years later, the journals are well-established and will continue to serve their communities as respected venues for high-quality research in chemistry and the allied fields.Recognizing that different authors have different accessibility to funding for Article Publication Charges (APCs), ACS also continues to support authors through the ACS special country pricing policy and ACS Read and Publish Agreements. Read and Publish agreements help institutions sustainably support the transition to open access, by growing the amount of work published open access, while also providing full access to ACS subscription content. Over the past five years, the number of ACS Read and Publish Agreements has expanded substantially, from covering 125 institutes in seven countries in 2019 to over 1,600 institutes across 46 countries in 2024 (Figure 1). 2024 also saw the establishment of first-of-their-kind \"Read and Green\" agreements to further expand the open access options ACS Publications provides for authors. We are delighted that ACS remains committed to expanding these agreements, enabling more authors to publish their work open access and for it to be available to anyone, anywhere in the world.Figure 1Figure 1. Growth of ACS Read and Publish Agreements since 2019.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWith such widespread and continually expanding coverage by Read and Publish agreements, authors based at many institutions around the world are choosing to publish open access even when their institutions or funding agencies do not require it. This is because open access papers and journals offer wider accessibility of published work, and authors naturally seek the broadest possible audience for their research products. Evidence for the increased usage can be seen in Figure 2, where the usage of hybrid ACS publications journals is dominated by researchers in East Asia and the Pacific (53%), the Western Hemisphere (21%), and Europe (19%), whereas usage of the Au family of journals includes a much stronger presence of readers in South Asia (15% vs 6% hybrid), the Middle East and North Africa (4.5% vs 1.2% hybrid), and Africa (1.5% vs 0.4% hybrid). All ten ACS Au journals received their inaugural full Journal Impact Factors (JIF) in the 2024 Journal Citation Reports, and with usage and citations continuing to grow year-on-year, it is anticipated that the momentum will continue as more researchers embrace open access publishing.Figure 2Figure 2. Global usage comparison of papers published in the ACS hybrid journal portfolio vs ACS gold open access journal portfolio 2021–2024.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe fully open access ACS Au journals have evolved to be highly author-centric. For instance, as a new journal, JACS Au is more than 10-fold smaller than the well-established Journal of the American Chemical Society, which allows our editorial team to invest substantial time understanding the nuance of each submission. In parallel, the Au community journals focus strongly on serving the needs of their respective scientific communities. As scientific communities are diverse, there have been numerous strategies employed to meet the needs of authors across the ten Au journals. For example, several editorials have been published across the portfolio that support authors by providing writing tips (DOI: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.2c00030), educating the community about giving proper CRediT (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.2c00029), and providing strategies for improving the visibility of publications (DOI: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00029). We have also leaned into the artistic creativity of our authors through editorials helping them with strategies for making cover art, and we have actively participated in the ACS Publications DEIR cover art series (DOIs: 10.1021/acsbiomedchemau.2c00028; 10.1021/acsorginorgau.2c00060; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00060; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00707; 10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00042; 10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00034; 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.4c00009). As the Au journals started during the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned quickly that a feeling of community is important for chemists and that our communities were looking for more than just advice on publishing. To this end, we have also provided editorials focused on mental health (10.1021/acspolymersau.2c00062) and strategies for fostering healthy, inclusive research ecosystems (10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00069; 10.1021/jacsau.2c00056).Another author- and reader-centric activity has been our focus on chemical education. Chemical education is critically important to the future of all chemists and our chemistry discipline, but traditionally, this topic has been primarily represented within the ACS Publications portfolio in the Journal of Chemical Education. The Au family of journals has the benefit that all content is available to anyone, anywhere in the world. Embracing this global reach, we have sought to publish interesting and innovative work on the pedagogy and scholarship of chemical education as well as new training materials of interest and value to researchers and educators across the globe who may not have access to ACS content through subscription. We have sought to ensure that the chemical education research community has a welcoming place to publish their latest research (DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00227; 10.1021/jacsau.3c00192), and we have supported the field through editorials and resources for educators. We have highlighted new teaching materials and cooperatives that help educators get the support and materials they need (DOIs: 10.1021/acsnanoscienceau.1c00020; 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00014), and we have published open access tutorials and methods/protocols that can be used directly as alternatives or supplements to costly textbooks in undergraduate and graduate courses (DOIs: 10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00070; 10.1021/jacsau.4c00979). Finally, ACS has made a commitment to chemical educators at primarily undergraduate educational institutions with an ACS-sponsored Read and Publish agreement that waives the APC so that chemists can publish undergraduate research at over 170 institutions across the United States.Growing visibility and building relationships with the scientific communities we serve have been crucial for the ACS Au portfolio in these formative years. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to grow the number and diversity of publications in the journals and to celebrate this great content. It was also important to us that researchers at all career stages felt like they were represented. We have established an Early Career Advisory Board at JACS Au and the \"Rising Stars\" Special Issue series in the ACS Au community journals. Initiatives highlighting the researchers shaping the future of their fields will continue to be a feature of the Au journals into our future.As we close out this editorial, we would be remiss not to thank the numerous individuals and groups that have contributed to the growth and success of the Au family of journals. This includes our retired Editors and recently appointed Editors (Tables 1 and 2), as well as our dozens of dedicated Editorial Advisory Board members across the family of Au journals. We thank the authors who boldly submitted papers to our journals in the early days when global understanding of OA publishing was still limited, as well as our repeat authors who now, after five years, have published with us numerous times, in some cases more than a half dozen papers across the last four years. Finally, we have to thank all our referees. Peer review is the backbone of rigorous scientific publishing, and manuscripts published by ACS Publications are the most trusted, most cited, and most read because of the quality of our peer reviews and peer reviewers. Thank you to all the reviewers who have helped make the Au family of journals thrive.Table 1.

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the structural changes of lithium borate (LiB) glass 25Li2O-(75 - x)B2O3 was conducted in the absence and presence of lead(II) oxide or aluminum oxide (x = 10 mol %) glass modifiers. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were used to explore the structural properties of LiB glass by incorporating trace amounts of manganese(III) oxide (0.00-0.25 mol %) as a probe. Differential thermal analysis and XRD results for the glasses and their ceramics confirmed the integration of aluminum atoms into the glass framework by forming a lithium aluminum boron oxide Li2(AlB5O10) crystalline phase. Lead atoms were located interstitially, which disordered the borate glass structure and produced a lithium tetraborate crystalline phase. Semiempirical modeling of the glass structures was conducted to estimate the fundamental vibrational modes of the glass materials using a parametric method 3 (PM3MM) with molecular mechanics corrections to elucidate the geometry of the borate (BO3) groups and their possible vibrational modes. Our analysis revised the conventional representation of the tetrahedral BO4 units, which were not observed, to \"distorted-trigonal\" BO3 groups and associated with nonbridging oxygen (NBO) atoms. EPR spectroscopy established a link between the NBO in oxides and the well-defined peak at g-factor ∼4.2 in glass materials, which had been assigned to iron(III) ions according to the literature.",

In this study, we use isotope exchange pulse responses to elucidate the oxygen exchange mechanism for (Bi0.8Tm0.2)2O3-δ (BTM)-(La0.8Sr0.2)0.99MnO3-δ (LSM) composites. With an optimized composition and microstructure, these composites can achieve polarization resistances below 0.01 Ω·cm2 at 700 °C. Analysis of the oxygen exchange rate, , by splitting it into elementary processes using the serial two-step scheme, demonstrates that both the dissociative adsorption and incorporation of oxygen are accelerated in BTM-LSM compared to the parent phases. Dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen is rate-limiting below 900 °C in the range 0.002-0.05 atm O2 and below 850 °C in 0.21 atm O2. Cation interdiffusion or changes in the electronic structure at the interface between the two materials create an electrocatalytically active region spanning 1-40 nm around the BTM-LSM phase boundary. Oxygen exchange coefficients within this region were estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of the entire composite surface. We propose two potential pathways for oxygen exchange in BTM-LSM, with calculated p O2 dependencies for each rate-determining step (rds). The p O2 dependency of reveals that molecular oxygen is involved in the rds.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the low-temperature behavior of concentrated aqueous solutions of cesium chloride and discover two hydrates of CsCl. We employ four different methods, namely, (i) simple cooling at rates between 0.5 and 80 K s–1, (ii) simple cooling followed by pressurization, (iii) hyperquenching at 106 to 107 K s–1, and (iv) hyperquenching followed by pressurization. Depending on the method, different types of phase behaviors are observed, which encompass crystallization involving freeze-concentration, pressure-induced amorphization, full vitrification, and polyamorphic transformation. The CsCl hydrates discovered in our work cold-crystallize above 150 K upon heating after ultrafast vitrification (routes iii and iv) and show melting temperatures below the eutectic temperature of 251 K. We determine the composition of these hydrates to be CsCl·5H2O and CsCl·6H2O and find evidence for their existence in ESEM, calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. The dominant and less metastable hydrate is the hexahydrate, where the pentahydrate appears as a minority species. We also reveal the birthplace for the CsCl hydrates, namely, the freeze-concentrated solution (FCS) formed upon cold-crystallization of the fully glassy solution (from iii and iv). The spongy FCS produced upon cooling of the liquid (from i and ii) is incapable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. By contrast, the FCS produced upon heating the glassy solution (from iii and iv) shows tiny, fine features that are capable of crystallizing CsCl-hydrates. Our findings contradict the current knowledge that alkali chlorides only have hydrates for the smaller cations Li+ and Na+, but not for the larger cations K+, Rb+, and Cs+ and pave the way for future determination of CsCl-hydrate crystal structures. The pathway to metastable crystalline materials outlined here might be more generally applicable and found in nature, e.g., in comets or on interstellar dust grains, when glassy aqueous solutions crystallize upon heating.",

Existing degradation techniques are frequently lacking due to their low efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and potential for secondary contamination. Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) technology has emerged as a promising alternative, utilizing energized reactive species to break down PFASs under ambient conditions. Therefore, this review examines the efficacy and effectiveness of CAP in degrading PFASs by reviewing various CAP setups and examining the key factors involved. This review also aims to further the development of CAP as a viable solution for PFAS degradation by addressing outstanding challenges and future directions in soil and water treatment.",

Our work introduces the use of heavy atoms as a strategy for suppressing phonon transport in organic molecules. Starting with a one-dimensional (1D) force-constant model and density functional theory calculations of model chemical systems, we illustrate how increasing the mass of a central atom affects phonon transmission and conductance. Following this, we turned our attention to the chemically accessible systems of metallapolyynes and extended metal atom chains (EMACs). Our findings suggest that several of the studied EMACs exhibit thermal conductance either near or below a recently proposed threshold of 10 pW/K─a crucial step toward reaching high thermoelectric figure of merits. Specifically, we predict that the molecule MoMoNi(npo)4(NCS)2 has a thermal conductance of just 8.3 pW/K at 300 K. Our results demonstrate that conceptually simple chemical modifications can markedly reduce the thermal conductance of single molecules; these results both deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving single-molecule phonon thermal conductance and suggest a path toward using single molecules as thermoelectric materials.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the onset of degradation in the air electrode within solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), and the subsequent impact on cell performance, is a critical step in mitigating the performance losses and stability issues of SOECs. In an effort to identify early onset degradation phenomena, SOECs were characterized as fabricated and after testing potentiostatically at 1.3 V for 1000 h at 750 °C. SOEC air electrodes composed of a 1:1 composite of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (6428-LSCF) and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) were studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS), and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) to evaluate the changes in the air electrode structurally and chemically. These techniques show the migration of Sr species from the air electrode through pores in the GDC barrier layer, progressing to the electrolyte boundary, where it accumulates and reacts with (Zr0.84Y0.16)O2-δ (YSZ) to form SrZrO3. Microscopy results are paired with atomistic simulations to better understand the relationship between the thermodynamic instability of 6428-LSCF and cell fabrication/testing conditions. First-principles calculations reveal that LSCF-6428 is not stable during cell manufacturing and testing conditions, which supports the experimental identification of secondary phases in both as-fabricated and tested cells. Together, these results demonstrate that the challenging environments encountered by SOECs during cell manufacturing and operation lead to instabilities of the target 6428-LSCF anode material and underscore the need for more durable, high-performing SOEC components.",

Rotaxanes are composed of a macrocyclic structure that is mechanically interlocked with a linear molecule. These mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) provide a potential chemical environment that allows for the interaction with cations. In this study, the bonding situations between rotaxanes or their acyclic/cyclic molecular derivatives and: (i) transition metal (Zn2+ and Cd2+); or (ii) alkali metal (Li+, Na+, and K+), cations have been studied. It is notable that among the MIMs structures, the rotaxanes demonstrate enhanced interactions with cations in comparison to the cyclic and, notably, the acyclic derivative molecules. The modification of rotaxane structures through structural changes and chemical reduction represents an intriguing approach to enhance cationic recognition, which is supported by the formation of more favorable electrostatic and/or orbital interaction energies in comparison with Pauli repulsive energies. The findings of this investigation can be employed in the synthesis of compounds with enhanced cation recognition capabilities.",

Examples are drawn from amorphous silicon and silica literature as well as from molecular glasses. Our outlook stresses the need for new computational methods to extend the time- and length-scales accessible through numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "The direct conversion of dinitrogen to nitrate is a dream reaction to combine the Haber–Bosch and Ostwald processes as well as steam reforming using electrochemistry in a single process. Regrettably, the corresponding nitrogen oxidation (NOR) reaction is hampered by a selectivity problem, since the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored in the same potential range. This opens the search for the identification of active and selective NOR catalysts to enable nitrate production under anodic reaction conditions. While theoretical considerations using the computational hydrogen electrode approach have helped in identifying potential material motifs for electrocatalytic reactions over the last decades, the inherent complexity of the NOR, which consists of ten proton-coupled electron transfer steps and thus at least nine intermediate states, poses a challenge for electronic structure theory calculations in the realm of materials screening. To this end, we present a different strategy to capture the competing NOR and OER at the atomic scale. Using a data-driven method, we provide a framework to derive generalized design criteria for materials with selectivity toward NOR. This leads to a significant reduction of the computational costs, since only two free-energy changes need to be evaluated to draw a first conclusion on NOR selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy offers profound insights into the vibrational dynamics of spinel ferrites, yet the precise assignment of these modes presents a notable challenge. This difficulty stems from the complex structure of spinel ferrites, where metal cations of varying spins populate distinct lattice sites, complicating the spectroscopic characterization. Specifically, cobalt ferrite is extensively utilized in electronic applications due to its superior magnetic properties, influenced significantly by the degree of inversion, denoted as (x), and the spin configurations within the crystal. While the magnetic influences of (x) are well-documented, its impact on other material properties has not been thoroughly investigated through first-principles calculations. This study delves into how varying degrees of inversion from (x = 0) to (x = 1) and different magnetic interactions-ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, and antiferromagnetism-affect the Raman vibrational modes of cobalt ferrite. We introduce a new perspective on the mode assignments by comparing our findings with existing experimental data. These insights could significantly refine experimental synthesis protocols, ensuring the production of materials optimized for specific applications. The interplay between inversion and spin configurations not only elucidates the vibrational properties but also enhances our understanding of the fundamental physics governing these versatile materials.",

Such transformations often involve fundamental processes such as bond breaking and formation, energy transfer, proton transfer, and electron transfer that can occur on ultrafast time scales. These processes are critical to existing industry as well as emerging technologies including areas such as catalysts, energy conversion and storage, sensing, and optronics. In parallel, ultrafast probes of chemical transformations have continued to advance. New developments include new ways to combine ultrafast probes with in situ reactions, whether in the gas or condensed phase. Other advancements include development of probes that reach the attosecond time domain, spectroscopies that are multidimensional, and ultrafast pulses in the X-ray regions. To highlight recent advances in the field, we are pleased to present this ACS Physical Chemistry Au virtual special issue on \"Ultrafast Spectroscopy of Chemical Transformations\", which includes papers covering different aspects of ultrafast studies of dynamics of interest in physical chemistry.The Article by Lynam and Hunt et al. studies the solution phase structure, vibrational properties, and ultrafast relaxation dynamics of the precatalyst species Mn(ppy)(CO)4 in solution using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00037). Time-resolved IR results reveal the presence of ultrafast (few ps) intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution between carbonyl stretching modes prior to vibrational relaxation, which is relatively solvent-insensitive and suggests limited solvent–solute interactions in the ground electronic state. The study provides a detailed picture of the complex potential energy surface, bonding and vibrational dynamics of Mn(ppy)(CO)4.The Letter by Schlenker et al. focuses on ultrafast pump–photolysis–probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy on the intermediate TAHzH· heptazinyl radical produced from an excited state proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction of trianisole heptazine (TAHz), as a monomeric analogue for carbon nitride, with 4-methoxyphenol (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00030). The results demonstrate an optically gated photolysis that releases H· and regenerates ground state TAHz. The TAHzH· radical signature at 520 nm had a lifetime of 7.0 ps, and its photodissociation by the photolysis pulse is demonstrated by the ground state bleach recovery of the closed-shell neutral TAHz, as previously predicted as evidence of a dissociative πσ* state. This first experimental demonstration of photolysis of the TAHzH· heptazinyl radical through a repulsive πσ* state is a critical feature of the proposed reaction mechanisms involving water oxidation and CO2 reduction.The Letter by McCaslin and Ramasesha et al. investigates the ultrafast photodissociation of nickel tetracarbonyl─a prototypical metal–ligand model system at 197 nm using mid-infrared TA spectroscopy to probe the bound C═O stretching modes (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00033). Evidence was found for the picosecond time scale production of highly vibronically excited nickel dicarbonyl and nickel monocarbonyl, in marked contrast with a prior investigation at 193 nm. Spectral evolution with a 50 ps time constant suggests an additional dissociation step, and the absence of any corresponding growth in signal strongly indicates the production of bare Ni, a heretofore unreported product from single-photon excitation of nickel tetracarbonyl.The Article by Burt and Warne et al. uses time-resolved extreme UV spectroscopy to investigate photodissociation within the iodobenzene C-band by photolyzing the carbon–iodine bond of iodobenzene at 200 nm and probing the ensuing dynamics at 10.3 nm (120 eV) over a 4 ps range (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00036). Two product channels were observed and subsequently isolated using a global fitting method. Their onset times and energetics were assigned to distinct electron transfer dynamics initiated following site-selective ionization of the iodine photoproducts, enabling the electronic states of the phenyl fragments to be identified using a classical over-the-barrier model for electron transfer. In combination with previous theoretical work, a detailed picture was developed for the corresponding neutral photochemistry and photophysics.The paper by Tiwari et al. studies the impact of entasis caused by stress induced by the surrounding lattice on the excited state dynamics of a prototypical copper(I)-based photocatalyst in single crystal form (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00047). Using femtosecond broadband TA spectroscopy, triplet state formation from the entactic state is studied and to be faster (∼3.9 ps) in crystals compared to solution (∼11.3 ps). The observed faster intersystem crossing in crystals hints toward the possible existence of distorted square planar geometry with higher spin–orbit coupling at the minima of the S1 state. The influence of entasis on vibrationally coherent photoinduced Jahn–Teller distortions was also discussed. The findings reveal the photophysical properties of the copper complex under lattice-induced stress, which may enhance the broader applicability of the entatic state concept in other transition metal systems.The Letter by Zhang et al. focuses on carrier spin dynamics in metal halide perovskite magic sized clusters (PMSCs) with unique optical and electronic properties (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00051). The study found that for ultrasmall sized nanoclusters, electron-surface (of defect) scattering likely plays an important role in carrier spin relaxation. The electron spin lifetime is shorter in such PMSCs compared to similar perovskite quantum dots due to larger surface-to-volume ratio and increased electron-surface scattering.Somewhat different to ultrafast studies based on ultrafast lasers, the Perspective by Tickner, Singh, Zhivonitko and Telkki provides a review on the approach of \"ultrafast\" nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that uses spatial encoding to record an entire two-dimensional (2D) data set in just a single scan and can be applied to either Fourier-transform or Laplace-transform NMR (DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00042). Data acquisition times are significantly shorter than traditional 2D/Laplace NMR experiments, which allows monitoring of rapid chemical transformations. The Perspective also outlines the principles of ultrafast NMR and focuses on examples of its use to detect fast molecular conversions in situ with high temporal resolution, along with some future directions. It should be noted that the \"ultrafast\" time scale referred to here for NMR is on the millisecond to second time scales, which differs significantly from the ultrafast time scale based on lasers (fs and ps).Together, these articles provide a glimpse of recent activities in the study of ultrafast dynamics relevant to physical chemistry. Our thanks go to the authors for choosing to publish their work in ACS Physical Chemistry Au, and to the reviewers for their contributions to these papers. We hope you find these contributions as insightful as we have one can envision that the field of ultrafast studies in physical chemistry will continue to evolve and expand as a major subfield and contribute significantly to the development and advancement of chemistry.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsTanja Cuk, Associate Editor, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1635-2946, Email: [email protected]Jin Z.

Their low toxicity, affordability, and biocompatibility make them a promising alternative in developing next-generation solar cells. This study explored carbon nanodots (CNDs) as an alternative to traditional carbon allotropes, focusing on creating sustainable and environmentally friendly Grätzel-type solar cells using low-cost materials. The feasibility of CNDs, in conjunction with Leandra australis fruit dye as TiO2 sensitizers, was investigated, as well as the impact on the diffusion coefficient of I3 - in the electrolyte due to excess I2. The synergistic interaction between the dye and CNDs altered the material energy states, red-shifting the solution's light absorption region (Dye-CNDs). Improved V oc and J sc values were recorded, and as a result, a 5% increase in energy conversion efficiency (η) was calculated for the FTO/TiO2-Dye-CNDs photoanode cell compared to the control photoanode cell (FTO/TiO2-Dye). These results highlight the promising potential of CNDs as a low-cost alternative to significantly enhance the potential of Grätzel-type solar cells, paving the way for more sustainable energy solutions.",

    "abstract": "The present study elucidated the role of both hydrogen and halogen bonds, from an electronic structure perspective, in the anion recognition process by the [2]catenane (1) containing a moiety with hydrogen bond donors entangled with another macrocyclic halogen bond donor. Spherical and nonspherical anions have been employed. The roles of different σ–hole donors have also been considered. The structure of 1 was modified by incorporating other σ–hole donors, namely bromine, chlorine, fluorine, as well as −Te–CH3 as a chalcogen bond donor, leading to the modified [2]catenanes 2–5. Insights into anion recognition were gained by quantifying the contributions of not only the mechanical but also hydrogen and halogen/chalcogen bonds to anion recognition using the GKS-EDA energy partition scheme and homodesmostic reactions scheme. GKS-EDA reveals that the anions Cl– and TS– exhibit the most stabilizing interactions with the 1 binding pocket. The EDA results confirm that by changing from a stronger σ-hole donor (I) to a weaker σ-hole donor (F) will have a considerable impact on anion interaction, thereby demonstrating that the halogen bonds formed between the [2]catenane and the anion play a pivotal role.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces the penta-structured semiconductor p-CGeP4 through density functional theory simulations, which possesses an indirect band gap transition of 3.20 eV. Mechanical analysis confirms the mechanical stability of p-CGeP4, satisfying Born-Huang criteria. Notably, p-CGeP4 has significant direct (e 31 = -11.27 and e 36 = -5.34 × 10-10 C/m) and converse (d 31 = -18.52 and d 36 = -13.18 pm/V) piezoelectric coefficients, surpassing other pentagon-based structures. Under tensile strain, the band gap energy increases to 3.31 eV at 4% strain, then decreases smoothly to 1.97 eV at maximum stretching, representing an ∼38% variation. Under compressive strain, the band gap decreases almost linearly to 2.65 eV at -8% strain and then drops sharply to 0.97 eV, an ∼69% variation. Strongly basic conditions result in a promising band alignment for the new p-CGeP4 monolayer. This suggests potential photocatalytic behavior across all tensile strain regimes and significant compression levels (ε = 0% to -8%). This study highlights the potential of p-CGeP4 for groundbreaking applications in nanoelectronic devices and materials engineering.",

    "abstract": "In-droplet hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX)-mass spectrometry (MS) experiments have been conducted for peptides of highly varied conformational type. A new model is presented that combines the use of protection factors (PF) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with intrinsic HDX rates (kint) to obtain a structure-to-reactivity calibration curve. Using the model, the relationship of peptide structural flexibility and HDX reactivity for different peptides is elucidated. Additionally, the model is used to describe the degree of conformational flexibility and structural bias for the disease-relevant Nt17 peptide; although highly flexible, intrinsically primed for facile conversion to α-helical conformation upon binding with molecular partners imparts significant in-droplet HDX protection for this peptide. In the future, a scale may be developed whereby HDX reactivity is predictive of the degree of structural flexibility and bias (propensity to form 2° structural elements such as α-helix, β-sheet, and β-turn) for intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such structural resolution may ultimately be used for high-throughput screening of IDR structural transformation(s) upon binding of ligands such as drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to improve safety and cycling stability of liquid electrolytes, the use of dicarbonates has been explored. In this study, four dicarbonate structures with varying end groups and spacers are investigated. The effect of these structural differences on the physical and ion transport properties is elucidated, showing that the end group has a significant influence on ion transport. The solvation structure and ion transport in the dicarbonates are compared to those of the linear carbonates dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). Although the carbonate coordination numbers (CN) are similar in the different systems, the CN from the anion is higher in dicarbonate electrolytes. At low salt concentrations, rapid solvent exchange is observed in the DMC- and DEC-containing systems, transitioning to a more correlated ion transport at high salt concentration. In contrast, the exchange of solvents around lithium ions (Li+) is limited in the dicarbonate systems regardless of the salt concentration, with only one carbonate group from each molecule participating in the coordination. In addition, according to the molecular dynamics simulations, Li+ mainly moves together with coordinating dicarbonate molecules and anion(s).",

    "abstract": "The unique properties and versatile applications of natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES) have sparked significant interest in the field of green chemistry. Comprised of natural components that form liquids at room temperature through strong noncovalent electrostatic interaction, these solvents are cost-effective, nontoxic, and versatile. Betaine chloride-based NaDES, in particular, have shown promise in biocatalysis and sugar extraction due to their excellent properties. Despite their potential, the complex nature of these solvents, characterized by intense hydrogen bonding and proton transfer processes, poses significant challenges. This study employs quantum molecular dynamics (ab initio MD-AIMD) to explore the intricate NaDES-microstructure formed from betaine chloride and amino acids (arginine, histidine, lysine). Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of proton transfers within these solvents, demonstrating rapid and extensive hydrogen bonding interactions. The Van Hove correlation functions reveal that proton transfers are highly mobile, facilitating the formation and breaking of covalent hydrogen bonds. This dynamic behavior is further corroborated by the radial distribution functions, which indicate significant proton exchange between amino acids and betaine cations. Chloride anions play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of NaDES through strong interactions with proton donors. These findings advance our understanding of these eutectic solvents and their potential applications in sustainable chemical processes.",

    "abstract": "Novel coumarin-triphenyliminophosphorane (TPIPP) fluorophores, synthesized via a nonhydrolytic Staudinger reaction, exhibit remarkable redox-responsive optical properties. Upon chemical and electrochemical oxidation, these compounds display a hypsochromic shift in absorption from 430 to 350 nm, accompanied by up to 11-fold fluorescence enhancement under 405 nm excitation. The fluorescence switching occurs at an electrochemical oxidation potential of approximately +2.0 V. This enhanced one-photon excited fluorescence is attributed to an emissive radical effect, stemming from in situ generated radical cations at the polarizable iminophosphorane (P=N) bond. The radical formation was confirmed by trapping experiments using tetracyanoquinodimethane, which produced characteristic absorption of radical anions around 850 nm, and by electron spin resonance studies using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide as a spin trap. Conversely, two-photon excited fluorescence under 800 nm pulsed laser excitation decreases upon oxidation, likely due to reduced two-photon absorption resulting from altered π-conjugation. This work demonstrates that external redox modulation can induce significant changes in absorption profiles and enable switching between enhanced one-photon and diminished two-photon excited fluorescence, highlighting the potential of leveraging the controllable radical character of the P=N bond in designing redox-responsive fluorophores.",

    "abstract": "Donor–bridge–acceptor complexes (D–B–A) are important model systems for understanding of light-induced processes. Here, we apply two-color two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy to D–B–A complexes with a trans-Pt(II) acetylide bridge (D–C≡C–Pt–C≡C–A) to uncover the mechanism of vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). Site-selective 13C isotopic labeling of the bridge is used to decouple the acetylide modes positioned on either side of the Pt-center. Decoupling of the D-acetylide- from the A-acetylide- enables site-specific investigation of vibrational energy transfer (VET) rates, dynamic anharmonicities, and spectral diffusion. Surprisingly, the asymmetrically labeled D–B–A still undergoes intramolecular IVR between acetylide groups even though they are decoupled and positioned across a heavy atom usually perceived as a \"vibrational bottleneck\". Further, the rate of population transfer from the bridge to the acceptor was both site-specific and distance dependent. We show that vibrational excitation of the acetylide modes is transferred to ligand-centered modes on a subpicosecond time scale, followed by VET to solvent modes on the time scale of a few picoseconds. We also show that isotopic substitution does not affect the rate of spectral diffusion, indicating that changes in the vibrational dynamics are not a result of differences in local environment around the acetylides. Oscillations imprinted on the decay of the vibrationally excited acceptor-localized carbonyl modes show they enter a coherent superposition of states after excitation that dephases over 1–2 ps, and thus cannot be treated as independent in the 2D-IR spectra. These findings elucidate the vibrational landscape governing IR-mediated electron transfer and illustrate the power of isotopic labeling combined with multidimensional IR spectroscopy to disentangle vibrational energy propagation pathways in complex systems.",

    "abstract": "OaPAC is a photoactivated enzyme that forms a homodimer. The two blue-light using flavin (BLUF) photoreceptor domains are connected to the catalytic domains with long coiled-coil C-terminal helices. Upon photoreception, reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network between Tyr6, Gln48, and the chromophore in the BLUF domain and keto–enol tautomerization of Gln48 are thought to occur. However, the quantitative energetics of the photoisomerization reaction and how the BLUF domain's structural change propagates toward the catalytic domain are still unknown. We evaluate the free-energy differences among the dark-state and two different light-state structures by the free-energy perturbation calculations combined with QM/MM free-energy optimizations. Furthermore, we performed long-time MD simulations for the free-energetically optimized dark- and light-state structures to clarify the differences in protein dynamics upon photoisomerization. The free-energy difference between the two optimized light-state structures was estimated at ∼4.7 kcal/mol. The free-energetically optimized light-state structure indicates that the chemically unstable enol tautomer of Gln48 in the light state is stabilized by forming a strong hydrogen bonding network with the chromophore and Tyr6. In addition, the components of free-energy difference between the dark- and light-state structures show that the energy upon photoreception is stored in the environment rather than the internal photoreceived region, suggesting a mechanism to keep the photoactivated signaling state with the chemically unstable enol tautomer of Gln48. In the light state, a fluctuation of Trp90 near the C-terminal helix becomes large, which causes subsequent structural changes in the BLUF core and the C-terminal helix. We also identified residue pairs with significant differences concerning residue-wise contact maps between the dark and light states.",

The release of high-energy photons from this relaxation can be detrimental to human health; therefore, fluorescence quenchers need to be incorporated in commercial sunscreen formulations containing PBSA or DPDT. Troxerutin is a fluorescence quencher utilized for DPDT commercially. Here, its ability to quench the fluorescence of both PBSA and DPDT is evaluated using a dual-pronged approach by breaking down the multicomponent problem into its constituent parts. First, PBSA and DPDT's femtosecond to nanosecond photodynamics are uncovered in solution and on the surface of a human skin mimic to ascertain a benchmark. Second, these results are compared to their photodynamics in the presence of troxerutin. A significant reduction in the fluorescence lifetime is observed for both PBSA and DPDT on a human skin mimic with the addition of troxerutin, which is attributed to a Dexter energy transfer (DET) or Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching mechanism. This finding demonstrates the hitherto unseen fluorescence quenching mechanism of troxerutin on a human skin mimic and its role in quenching the fluorescence of commercial UV sunscreen filters through a DET or FRET mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Protein dynamics in the unfolded state, in the context of early stage protein folding or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), is not well understood. The discovery of IDPs, and their sequence-dependent dynamics, has led to many computational and experimental investigations regarding the conformational preferences of short oligopeptides and individual amino acid residues in the unfolded state. As proteins consist of sequences of amino acid residues, characterizing the intrinsic conformational preferences of the individual residues in the unfolded state is crucial for understanding the emergent conformations of peptides and proteins. While advances have been made in understanding conformational preferences, the atomistic mechanisms driving these preferences remain unresolved. In this work, we show that the distributions of atomic overlaps between backbone and side chain atoms in Ramachandran space are unique for amino acid residue mimetic structures alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine in Ramachandran space indicating unique intrapeptide energy landscapes for each residue. We then construct a mean field potential consisting of only an empirical peptide backbone-water and average intrapeptide Lennard-Jones contributions to explore their influence on the conformational preferences. With this fairly simple model, we were able to produce Ramachandran distributions that qualitatively agree with previously reported experimental and computational predictions about the conformational preferences of these amino acid residues in the unfolded state in water. Our results indicate these conformational preferences are the result of the balance between pPII-stabilizing backbone-water interactions and repulsive side chain-backbone interactions where the latter will depend uniquely on the atomic makeup and geometry of the side chain.",

In this work, phosphate glasses with 50P2O5-(50 – x)BaO-xDy2O3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 4.0 mol %) nominal compositions were prepared by melting and the impact of Dy3+ ions on glass physical, structural, thermo-mechanical, and optical properties was evaluated. Following refractive index, density, and X-ray diffraction characterizations, the glasses were studied comprehensively through Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dilatometry, optical absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The thorough investigation and data analyses shed light on the Dy3+-driven structural and thermal properties reported here for the first time. The thermal expansion behavior was put in context with the reported data for other lanthanides and analyzed in the framework of the high ionic field strengths, leading to tighter glass networks. Further, a detailed analysis of the absorption, PL, and emission decay curves was carried out, providing insights into the origin of the optical behavior. Supported is the hypothesis that the cross-relaxation channels between Dy3+ ions taking place at low concentrations are responsible for the decrease in the decay times while the PL attractive for lighting applications still improves. Conversely, high Dy3+ concentrations facilitate the emission quenching proceeding via an electric dipole–dipole interaction likely incorporating the resonant excitation migration pathway for Dy3+–Dy3+ mean distances shorter than ∼15 Å.",

The model is based on the coupling of the Frequency Dependent Fluctuating Charges and Fluctuating Dipoles (ωFQFμ), specifically designed to describe plasmonic substrates, and the polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) classical force field to model the solvating environment. The resulting ωFQFμ/FQ approach accounts for the interactions between the radiation and the NP, as well as with the surrounding solvent molecules, by incorporating mutual interactions between the plasmonic substrate and solvent. ωFQFμ/FQ is validated against reference TD-DFTB/FQ calculations, demonstrating remarkable accuracy, particularly in reproducing plasmon resonance frequency shifts for structures below the quantum-size limit. The flexibility and reliability of the approach are also demonstrated by simulating the optical response of homogeneous and bimetallic NPs dissolved in pure solvents and solvent mixtures.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we developed (thio)ureido-calix[4]arene derivatives and thoroughly explored their anion-binding properties in acetonitrile. A series of anions, including important inorganic ones (Cl–, HSO4–, H2PO4–, and HP2O73–) and several ever-present carboxylates (acetate, benzoate, and fumarate), were studied. All systems were investigated by several methods (NMR, ITC, and UV) used in a synergistic fashion, providing their comprehensive thermodynamic description. Acidities of the receptors were determined prior to the anion-binding studies and considered in the data-handling procedures. Complexes of various stoichiometries were detected and the driving force for their formation elucidated. The correlation of the anion structural features and H-bond acceptor properties with the stoichiometries and complexation thermodynamics parameters was rationalized. Generally, stability of the complexes followed the trend defined by the basicity of anions. Thiourea and urea analogues exhibited similar affinities for anion binding except for the H2PO4– and HP2O73–, which interacted with the thiourea analogue more strongly. The hosts endowed with 4 (thio)urea groups formed species containing two receptor molecules bridged by a fumarate or hydrogen pyrophosphate anion. Thermodynamic information provided in this work is applicable in further design of supramolecular systems, whereas the presented approach to data handling will aid researchers when dealing with multiple coexisting equilibria.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling methanol's infrared spectrum has challenged spectroscopists for a century, with numerous loose ends still to be explored. We engage in this exploration based on experiments of isolating single methanol molecules in solid argon and neon matrices. We report infrared spectra of methanol in its natural isotopic composition and with partial and full deuteration. These experiments are accompanied by calculating wavenumbers involving anharmonicity and mode-coupling based on the vibrational configuration interaction approach. This allows for an unambiguous assignment of all fundamentals and resonances in the mid-infrared spectrum. An increasing degree of deuteration lifts resonances and aids in assigning bands uniquely. It also becomes evident that different notations typically used in chemistry or physics to describe molecular vibration from spectroscopy fail to describe the spectra appropriately. We highlight the shortcomings and suggest a more elaborate analysis using Sankey diagrams to unambiguously identify spectral features. Consequently, we demystify debated resonances occurring from various stretches and deformations of the methyl group.",

They are formed via the anion-exchange reaction between lanthanide(III) bromide and metal(II) acetate salts and driven by a mismatch in hard-soft acid-base character. The crystal structure of EuHg revealed a heteropolymeric 1-D structure, with cationic acetate-bridged and anionic bromide-bridged chains forming parallel arrays; IR, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopic data of LnPb strongly suggested similarity with the LnHg compounds. The analogous reaction with EuCl3·6H2O and Hg(OAc)2 forms an isostructural material, but substituting Pb(OAc)2 generates [Eu(OAc)2(OH2)3]Cl and PbCl2 instead of a mixed-metal product comparable to LnPb. An N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate [Eu(OAc)2(DMF)3](PbBr3)] (EuPb·DMF) was structurally characterized, showing the same heteropolymeric motif as EuHg and resembling an organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskite due the anionic chain of face-sharing bromoplumbate(II) octahedra. Photoluminescence properties of the compounds, including lifetime measurements and Tb(III)→Eu(III) energy transfer parameters for the LnM 50:50 Eu/Tb solid-solutions are described.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) reflective pigments are considered as energy-efficient cooling materials to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect and reduce energy consumption. In this study, a novel blue pigment based on Mg1-xCoxTiO3 with high NIR reflectance was synthesized by spray pyrolysis, and its crystallographic and optical properties were investigated by varying the Co content and the calcination temperature. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and TEM analyses revealed that the prepared Mg1-xCoxTiO3 pigments possessed an impurity-free ilmenite crystal structure and a dense spherical shape with a uniform distribution of Co. The intense blue color is due to the 4T1g (F) → 4T1g (P) transition of Co2+ in the octahedral ligand field. The optimal Co content and calcination temperature for obtaining the highest NIR reflectance with excellent blue characteristics were determined to be 20% (x = 0.2) and 800 °C, respectively. As a result, the Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 blue pigment (L* = 59.8, a* = -1.23, b* = -36.8) shows a high NIR solar reflectance of 78.9%, which is 34% higher than that of CoAl2O4. The color difference (ΔE*) values before and after immersed in acid/alkaline solution are less than 1.0, indicating that Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 exhibits excellent chemical stability. The temperature rise test under NIR irradiation demonstrated that the synthesized Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 blue pigment exhibited improved heat shielding performance compared to that of CoAl2O4. Therefore, Mg0.8Co0.2TiO3 could be used as a promising cool blue pigment for sustainable solutions to alleviate heat accumulation due to sunlight.",

Herein, palladium-catalyzed regioselective tetra-arylation of a wide range of C(1)-N-aryl-o-carboranyl amides with aryl iodides has been developed. A variety of B(3,4,5,6)-tetra-arylated o-carboranes were synthesized in good-to-excellent yields. Moreover, the mono-, di-, and triarylated intermediate products were isolated, and the exact structures were determined by NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and X-ray analysis, which provide a rationale that the order of introduction of aryl groups into o-carborane is B(4) > B(5) > B(3)/B(6). This protocol represents a powerful synthetic method for constructing polyfunctionalization of o-carborane derivatives under very mild and simple reaction conditions, which offers a valuable reference for the design and synthesis of molecular propellers based on carboranes.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of phosphors with multiple capabilities has garnered significant interest, especially for applications in optical thermometry and dynamic anticounterfeiting technologies. In this work, we successfully synthesized a series of color-tunable Pr3+ single-doped Ca2InTaO6 (CITO:Pr3+) persistent luminescence (PersL) materials by using a high-temperature solid-state method. The crystal structure of the obtained CITO:Pr3+ phosphor was characterized by X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. Concentration-, excitation wavelength-, and temperature-dependent optical properties were systematically studied, and the results revealed that these materials display versatile luminescence behaviors and possess excellent optical temperature sensing characteristics and remarkable anticounterfeiting capabilities. Furthermore, by incorporating defect energy levels through nonequivalent substitution of Pr3+ for Ca2+, the materials also exhibit red PersL emission. This multimodal luminescence capability underpins their potential for dynamic multiple anticounterfeiting applications. Additionally, the differential thermal quenching rates between the 3P0 → 3H4 and 1D2 → 3H4 transitions of Pr3+ were leveraged for optical temperature sensing. The CITO:0.015Pr3+ phosphor, when excited at 318 nm, achieved maximum absolute sensitivity (Sa) and relative sensitivity (Sr) values of 20.42% K-1 at 393 K and 2.37% K-1 at 345 K, respectively. These results highlight the promising potential of CITO:Pr3+ materials for both multimodal dynamic anticounterfeiting and precise optical temperature measurement.",

However, this process is profoundly influenced by the intricate redox chemistry of Np itself and the diverse concomitant fission products in spent nuclear fuel, with the underlying mechanistic details remaining inadequately elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that molybdenum (Mo) and iron (Fe) dramatically accelerated the reduction rate of Np(V) by approximately 2 × 104-fold. Additionally, by integrating analytical techniques including absorption spectroscopy, stopped-flow spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and solvent extraction, we deciphered the electron transfer interactions between Mo and Fe, as well as their synergistic catalytic mechanism in driving the Np(V)-Np(IV) conversion.

Electrochemical studies revealed two one-electron reduction events: -0.12 and -0.77 V for Re(CO)3Cl(phendione) and -0.30 and -0.79 V for Re(CO)3Cl(AQphen) (vs Ag/AgCl). In the presence of CO2, the second reduction shifted positively by 0.20 and 0.14 V, indicating adduct formation.

DFT calculations supported formation of [quinone-CO2]2- adducts, with bond lengths of 1.447 and 1.406 Å. Under blue LED light (410 nm) and CO2, photochemical experiments showed spectral changes consistent with reduced quinone-CO2 species.

    "abstract": "The emergence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, clearly linked to the in vivo dissociation of Gd(III)-based MRI contrast agents (CA), has promoted intensive research to identify safe CA candidates. Towards this goal, we have designed the novel ligand H4OPDMA, which combines a rigidified macrocycle, low total ligand basicity, and malonate pendant arms to increase the number of donor atoms. Thanks to these design elements, H4OPDMA is capable of forming a Gd(III) chelate with high thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Indeed, the conditional stability of [Gd(OPDMA)]- (pGd = 14.8; pH 7.4, cGdL = 10-5 M) calculated for physiological conditions is comparable to that of [Gd(DTPA)]2- (pGd = 15.6), and its dissociation half-life is estimated to be 3.2 years at 37 °C and pH 7.4, making it an exceptionally inert chelate. Moreover, the water proton relaxation enhancement efficacy of [Gd(OPDMA)]- (r1 = 4.5 mM-1 s-1, 25°C, 20 MHz) is similar to that of clinical MRI contrast agents. Luminescence lifetime measurements and 17O NMR data confirmed the presence of one water molecule in the inner sphere of the metal ion (q = 1), which undergoes relatively fast exchange (kex298 = (73 ± 12) × 106 s-1). The fast water exchange can likely be related to an associatively activated mechanism, as suggested by the negative activation entropy, ΔS⧧ = -(7 ± 1) J mol-1 K-1. In accordance with this, DFT calculations indicate an eight-coordinated structure for the Gd(III) ion, involving one water molecule and seven donor atoms of the OPDMA4-, while one carboxylate group remains uncoordinated.",

Here, we explore the electrocatalytic behavior of a self-assembled copper porphyrin cube featuring iron nodes (Fe-Cu) using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as model transformations. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemical experiments, and XPS data revealed that Fe-Cu decompose to regenerate Cu-TAPP under catalytic conditions. The CO2RR versus HER activity of Fe-Cu was tested under heterogeneous conditions to preserve the preorganized cubic arrangement of porphyrins. Upon scission of the Fe-imine nodes, the catalytic activity of the constructed Fe-Cu differs from Cu-TAPP and physical mixtures of Fe(II) and Cu-TAPP. Like free Fe(II) salts, the Fe-Cu-based materials were more selective for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas Cu-TAPP generated a mixture of CO2RR products. Spectroscopic methods were used to establish that the Fe-Cu releases Cu-TAPP under reducing conditions, making the shift in selectivity particularly notable since the same active species is present in both systems. This study illustrates the use of self-assembly to preorganize catalytic sites and exploits the limited molecular movement under heterogeneous conditions to preserve a polynuclear microenvironment despite operating under conditions where the assembly does not remain intact.",

Electrochemical generation necessitates knowledge of the redox potentials involved, which is hindered by the lack of well-defined Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox waves in the voltammetry of many iron-based catalysts. Hence, other approaches including chemical oxidation and bulk spectro(electro)chemical methods need to be taken. In the case of the well-studied oxidation catalyst, [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+, where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine, estimates of the Fe(III/IV) redox potentials range from 0.4 to 1.3 V vs SCE. Here, we show that electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy reveals \"hidden\" redox waves, and hence redox potentials, when coupled with cyclic voltammetry. Rapid spectral acquisition (>2 Hz) of surface-enhanced Raman spectra at electrochemically roughened gold electrodes enables real-time spectral acquisition during cyclic voltammetry. We show that the Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox potential of [(N4Py)Fe(II)OH2]2+ is close to that determined earlier by chemical redox titrations (0.85 V vs SCE). Furthermore, comproportionation and adsorption processes are shown to impact the rates of electron transfer observed, which rationalizes the absence of a distinct Fe(III)/Fe(IV) redox wave in its cyclic voltammetry.",

    "abstract": "Neutral organometallic complexes containing a formally divalent terbium ion are especially scarce, owing to the highly negative TbIII/TbII reduction potential and the thermodynamic stability of the TbIII ion. In fact, there are only two crystallographically characterized neutral terbium(II) complexes known to date. Here, we present the synthesis of the unprecedented heteroleptic Tb(III) bis(amide) chloride complex, (NHAr*)2TbCl (1) (where Ar* = 2,6-(Ar')2C6H3, Ar' = 2,4,6-(iPr)3C6H2), which was chemically reduced using the strong reducing agent, KC8, to yield a new member of this small family of highly reactive TbII compounds, namely, the homoleptic terbium bis(amide) complex, (NHAr*)2Tb (2). Notably, the spectroscopic and magnetic characterization of 2 revealed that the compound contains a formally divalent terbium ion since the additional electron was exclusively found to reside in the primarily arene ligand-based π* orbitals, as corroborated by ab initio calculations. Furthermore, 2 exhibits slow magnetic relaxation between 1.8 and 16 K under a 1250 Oe applied dc field. Ab initio calculations uncovered that magnetic relaxation occurs through the first excited spin-orbit state. Study of 2 via SQUID magnetometry hints at considerably weaker 4f-5d magnetic coupling relative to other TbII complexes, rendering its electronic structure unique relative to that of other neutral organometallic TbII complexes.",

CO adsorption on various iron facets of relevance to the Fischer-Tropsch process suggest that the Fe(111) surface is the most active for catalysis, and that CO bound to the penultimate layer of Fe atoms or the b-state is the resting state during catalysis. Notably, a μ-1,2 mode was discarded for the b-state due to a lack of exemplar molecular species and expectation that such a mode would have a higher energy infrared (IR) absorption than observed experimentally (viz. 1735-1860 cm-1). Here, we report the synthesis of a diiron(I/II) complex in which CO binds μ-1,2: (Fe(OTf))(Fe(THF)(μ-1,2-CO))L where L2- is a bis(β-diketiminate) cyclophane (1). Surprisingly, the observed νCO at 1763 cm-1 for 1 compares well with that reported for b-state. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mössbauer, and density functional theory (DFT) results support a weakly coupled s = 3/2 iron(I) and s = 2 iron(II) pair.

By using Mn2CO3 or MnO2 as the manganese source, a complete self-reduction behavior of Mn4+ to Mn2+ was observed in the ZSO host, yielding intense green LPL, thermoluminescence (TL), and photostimulated luminescence (PSL) emission from Mn2+. The spontaneous reduction behavior originates from the intrinsic defect of the Zn vacancy (VZn) caused by Yb3+ and B3+ occupying the Zn2+ and Si4+ sites. The influence of synthetic conditions, including Mn sources and doping concentrations, on the crystal structure and optical (photoluminescence (PL), LPL, PSL, TL) properties was systematically investigated. By analyzing the TL spectra at different temperatures and heating rates, the trap depth and distribution of ZSO:Mn2+,Yb3+,B3+ were characterized. With the incorporation of Yb3+ and B3+, the intensity of LPL and PSL and the decay time of ZSO:Mn2+ improved significantly under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and near-infrared (NIR) stimulation. Utilizing the LPL, TL, and PSL properties of ZSO:Mn2+,Yb3+,B3+ phosphors, an intelligent LPL pattern was realized under various stimulations, which provides a quick-response approach for information encryption and optical information storage.",

For example, the formation of hydrogen bonds between the building blocks and molecules of the crystallization solvent may prevent the construction of the frameworks. Herein, we propose a guest-exchange-based strategy for converting non-HOF crystals to HOFs. Specifically, non-HOF crystals of bis(benzimidazole)ZnCl2 complex 1 (bis(benzimidazole) = phenylbis(benzimidazol-2-yl)methane) obtained from its N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution (12·(DMF)5) were converted to HOF crystals via the exchange of DMF to acetone or tetrahydrofuran by exposing 12·(DMF)5 to the corresponding vapor. Interestingly, the complete guest exchange is not always required, which further emphasizes the convenience of the guest-exchange strategy in HOF synthesis. We also demonstrate that HOF crystals synthesized via guest exchange can serve as an adsorber for acetone and diethyl-ether vapors.",

The results revealed that ligand exchange reactions are instantaneous, giving rise to the standard Gaussian distribution indicative of a random exchange or substitution process. In sharp contrast, metal exchange reactions are slow (hours to days), resulting in fractal-like patterns. The intercluster Au-Ag exchange occurs in the innermost icosahedral core of the cluster. These reactions, when performed with a permeable membrane separating the two reactants, provided strong evidence that both exchanges require bimolecular collisions resembling conventional SN2-type reactions between two superatomic clusters. This notion was further corroborated by the unexpected observation of \"half\" Au and \"half\" Ag peaks in the mass spectra, which may be taken as circumstantial evidence for the formation of a transient dimer [(AuAg)44(SR)30]28- upon intercluster collisions in solution. Finally, the effects of experimental conditions, such as solvent and temperature, were also investigated.",

In this paper, we obtained the UiO-68-NH2 (Zr-N) MOF with flake, octahedron, block, and flower morphologies in different sizes by adjusting the concentrations of acetic acid and water modulators. It is disclosed that the introduced acetic acid can compete with organic ligands for coordination with zirconium nodes, whereas water can affect the hydrolysis rate of zirconium precursors, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystal growth of the Zr-N crystals. Therefore, their synergistic effect led to the successful synthesis of Zr-N ions with different morphologies and sizes. Notably, the flower-like Zr-N with a size of about 100 nm and maximum specific surface area exposure of abundant active sites, which facilitates the diffusion of reactants as well as enhances the separation and transfer rate of photogenerated carriers, endowing it with excellent hydrogen evolution performance (989 μmol g-1 h-1) and being about 75 times higher than that of the bulk Zr-N counterpart (13 μmol g-1 h-1).

    "abstract": "Developing catalysts with high efficiency and low cost for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is attractive but challenging. Herein, relying on the high catalytic activity of Ni, low overpotential of Co, and superior antipoisoning resistance of Mo, a NiMoO4-NiCo2O4 p-p heterojunction is constructed via a hydrothermal strategy followed by calcination. Interestingly, phase transformation of β-NiMoO4 to α-NiMoO4 occurs when a heterojunction is generated. The unique structure of NiMoO4-NiCo2O4 enables faster charge transfer capability, greater active site availability, lower impedance, and reduced activation energy. Thus, a much better catalytic performance for the UOR is triggered when employing NiMoO4-NiCo2O4 as a catalyst. A specific current density of 1306 mA cm-2 mg-1 (at 0.6 V vs Hg/HgO) is achieved for NiMoO4-NiCo2O4, which is much larger than that for NiMoO4 and NiCo2O4. Potential-dependent impedance analyses unveil that Ni3+ should be active sites and both indirect and direct urea oxidation paths should be accelerated on NiMoO4-NiCo2O4. Phase transformation of β-NiMoO4 to α-NiMoO4 is vital. Making the energy bands of NiCo2O4 and NiMoO4 match better, promoting Ni3+ formation, facilitating active sites exposure, and reducing alkalinity to enhance antipoisoning capacity all make sense. This work stresses the importance of crystal phases in developing heterojunctions with high catalytic performance.",

Particularly, LCCO-24 exhibited high activity and improved reaction kinetics for both the OER and HER under alkaline conditions. When employed for overall water splitting, it achieved a low full-cell voltage of 1.49 V at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2, comparable to leading noble metal catalysts. Analysis confirmed that the enhancement in bifunctional electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the increased presence of oxygen defects and the increase in surface area.

In addition, the composite of Co(II)-CP with the short hydroxyl multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Co(II)-CP@HCNTs) was prepared via an in situ preparation strategy. Amperometric current response reveals that the glass carbon electrodes (GCEs) of Co(II)-CP and Co(II)-CP@HCNTs exhibit highly sensitive electrochemical sensing toward NO2- and Fe3+ in the corresponding electrolytes. Co(II)-CP@HCNTs demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performance toward NO2- oxidation and Fe3+reduction to Co(II)-CP. The sensing mechanisms for NO2- and Fe3+ were illustrated with Hirshfeld surface analysis and density of states calculations. Furthermore, this methodology was successfully implemented on a miniaturized screen-printed electrode (SPE) platform. Among the three tested electrodes, the Co(II)-CP@HCNT-modified SPEs exhibited superior sensing capabilities, showing response ranges of 0.002-20 mM for nitrite and 0.002-38 mM for ferric ions, respectively.

Moreover, Co(II)-CP@HCNTs/SPE was further validated through practical applications for the detection of both analytes in real-world samples in the respective electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "Developing high-performance cathode materials with enhanced stability and fast charge transport kinetics is crucial for advancing aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we introduce S-doped VO2 (S-VO2) as a cathode material, leveraging sulfur incorporation to regulate the electronic structure, suppress vanadium dissolution, and improve electrochemical performance. The introduction of sulfur not only induces oxygen vacancies, which enhance electronic conductivity and facilitate rapid electron transfer, but also strengthens the V-O bond, effectively mitigating vanadium dissolution during cycling. As a result, the S-VO2 cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 386.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, retains 79.6% of its capacity over 1600 cycles at 2.0 A g-1, and exhibits outstanding long-term durability with 80.3% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at 10.0 A g-1. Ex situ XRD, in situ Raman, and XPS analyses confirm the highly reversible Zn2+ storage mechanism, while XANES and EXAFS studies reveal that S doping stabilizes the local coordination environment of vanadium, reducing structural distortions and enhancing cycling stability. This work highlights the synergistic role of sulfur doping and oxygen defects in optimizing cathode materials, providing valuable insights for the design of next-generation AZIBs with superior performance and long-term reliability.",

    "abstract": "Photocatalysis plays a crucial role in modern organic synthesis by enabling efficient transformations under mild conditions and reducing the need for harmful reagents. Its ability to harness visible light for sustainable chemical processes makes it an attractive alternative to conventional methods. In this study, we have utilized two silver-based MOFs, incorporating two different Co3+-metalloligands, as photocatalysts for oxidation reactions and oxidative coupling processes. The reactions include the oxidation of phenylboronic acids to phenols and the oxidative coupling of amines and anilines to imines and azo compounds. Ag-MOFs demonstrated significant visible light absorption and excellent chemical stability, with superoxide radicals identified as the primary reactive oxygen species. The photocatalytic performance is supported by band gap energy calculation and photophysical studies, including electrochemical impedance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The photocatalytic performance of an Ag-MOF was critically influenced by its architecture, including the presence of argentophilic interactions. Such a feature not only enhanced its structural stability but also improved the light absorption, a more significant number of active sites, better charge separation, and a remarkable photocatalytic outcome.",

    "abstract": "A systematic investigation of the coordination chemistry of iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes synthesized from pyridyl-amine ligands was performed, focusing on how ligand steric hindrance and metal centers affect oxidation behavior, coordination modes, and biological activities. The study revealed that steric hindrance at the ligand's bridge carbon strongly influenced both oxidation behavior and coordination modes. Smaller substituents (e.g., H and Me) facilitated oxidation to form pyridyl-imine species under adventitious oxygen, whereas bulky substituents (e.g., i-Bu and mesityl) suppressed oxidation, yielding stable pyridyl-amine or 16-electron pyridyl-amido complexes. Moreover, iridium(III) complexes were more prone to oxidation than the corresponding ruthenium(II) complexes under similar conditions. The aqueous stability of the newly synthesized complexes was confirmed. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that most of the complexes exhibited notable anticancer potency against A549, HeLa and cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cancer cells. Mechanistic studies suggested a redox-driven pathway involving the catalytic oxidation of NADH to NAD+, the elevation of ROS levels and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Notably, pyridyl-amine complexes induced apoptosis, while 16-electron pyridyl-amido complexes did not, though both caused S phase cell cycle arrest. Additionally these complexes can inhibit A549 cell migration, suggesting their potential to reduce cancer metastasis.",

Cyanobacteria must tightly regulate metal homeostasis to prevent deficiency or toxicity, yet their metallophores remain overlooked. Here, we report lusichelins A-E (1-5), new metallophores isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lusitaniella coriacea LEGE 07167. Their structures and configurational assignments were determined by using NMR, mass spectrometry, TD-DFT calculations, and retrobiosynthetic insights. Lusichelins feature a unique structural arrangement with thiazoline/thiazole rings connected via a vinyl group, an aliphatic carbon chain, or directly enabling the potential for metal coordination. Genomic analysis identified a hybrid PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with the lusichelin structure, bearing traits characteristic of metallophore biosynthesis. Functionally, lusichelins act as metallophores capable of chelating both iron and copper. Lusichelin C (3) consistently bound iron under both metal-rich and metal-limited culture conditions, while copper complexation was only observed under elevated copper levels. At physiologically relevant pH values, no significant metal-binding preference was detected. Moreover, compound production was maximized under metal-rich conditions and in response to copper limitation. Lusichelin B (2) exhibited cytotoxicity against colon carcinoma cells while reversing multidrug resistance via ABCB1 efflux pump modulation. These findings expand our understanding of cyanobacterial metallophores in microbial metal homeostasis and highlight their biological potential.",

It was assumed that HICA in fusarihexins D and E would have the same configuration, as they are derived from the same biological source. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structures of fusarihexins D and E as well as three new analogues. The compounds were synthesized by employing solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and high dilution macrolactamization and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Comparing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of synthesized and natural compounds revealed that the HICA residue has the S-configuration in fusarihexin D. The antiplasmodium activity on Plasmodium falciparum and antitumor activity against MCF7 and A431 cells were also investigated. Encouragingly, fusarihexin D (with S-HICA) displayed potent antiplasmodium activity by interfering with the ring stage of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite life cycle (IC50 at 650 nM).",

The combination of a hydrophobic group at the 3'-position and a phenolic hydroxy group at the 4'-position was crucial for the high activity.

    "abstract": "Cordyceps militaris is a valuable edible and medicinal fungus. Its chemical composition and biological activity have become the focus of attention. In this study, three unusual C30 ergosterols, cordycepsterols A-C (1-3), have been isolated from this fungus. Their structures have been identified according to extensive spectroscopic methods as well as computational quantum chemistry. They possess an unusual 6/6/6/5/6-fused pentacyclic system which might be derived from a normal ergosterol backbone by adding two skeletal carbons. Compounds 1-3 exhibit significant inhibitory activity against nitric oxide production with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 3.0, 0.9, and 2.3 μM, respectively. They could significantly suppress the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 at the concentration of 5 μM, which indicated that C. militaris and its cordycepsterols A-C have a potential anti-inflammatory application prospect.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived natural products are commonly consumed orally and can be structurally modified by the gut microbiota, potentially altering their biological activity. However, high-throughput studies on their microbial metabolism remain limited. This study applied an in vitro screening system for microbiome-derived metabolism using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolism of 200 natural products by human gut microbiota, and successfully annotated 118 natural products metabolized by gut microbiota. For the first time, metabolic reactions of isorhynchophylline and wilforgine in the intestine were documented. Notably, a substantial increase in the plasma concentration of isocorynoxeine was observed in human microbiota-colonized rats following isorhynchophylline administration compared to those without colonization, suggesting that the dehydrogenation of isorhynchophylline by gut microbiota observed in the in vitro screening system also occurs in vivo. 16S rRNA gene sequencing further revealed an increased abundance of Klebsiella and Escherichia-Shigella following isorhynchophylline administration, suggesting that these genera may influence its microbial transformation or pharmacological activity.",

Prenylation and oxidation further diversify these structures, enhancing their bioactivity and membrane affinity. Despite recent advances, the biosynthetic pathways of IDKPs, especially those involving dual prenylation, remain inadequately understood. In this study, the fellutanine biosynthetic gene cluster from Nannizzia fulva was cloned and heterologously expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. A partially oxidized intermediate in the fellutanine biosynthetic pathway was characterized. The dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS) enzyme FelB was shown to catalyze consecutive prenylations at two C-2 positions of cyclo(l-Trp-l-Trp) in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Additionally, comparative studies with the known DMATS enzyme OkaC revealed differences in the regioselectivity. Furthermore, the biprenylation mechanism of FelB and OkaC was elucidated through molecular docking and active site analysis.",

Using combinatorial biosynthesis, we were able to manipulate the biosynthetic route to yield hydroxylated pathway congeners, most notably the new natural products deoxyascocorynin (10), hydroxyterferol (11), and hydroxyallantofuranone (12).",

    "abstract": "Natural polymers have garnered attention due to their unique properties, i.e., structural versatility, biocompatibility, and modifiability. Recent efforts focus on sustainable raw materials to develop environmentally friendly processes and products that align with global sustainability goals. Among these, Chios mastic gum, derived from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia), is notable for its diverse food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics applications. One of its key components is cis-1,4-poly-β-myrcene, a natural polyterpene polymer, constituting 20-30% of the resin's composition. Despite its potential, the complex composition of Chios mastic gum poses challenges in extracting, isolating, and quantifying its polymeric content. NMR spectroscopy offers a nondestructive approach and may be instrumental in developing standardized methods for quantifying cis-1,4-poly-β-myrcene in Chios mastic gum. Such methods are vital for understanding the resin's composition and exploring potential applications, particularly in sustainable materials and biomedical fields. This study addresses these challenges by producing a cis-1,4-poly-β-myrcene sample as a standard in quantification procedures. Centrifugal partition chromatography, a support-free liquid-liquid chromatography technique, was employed to purify the polymeric fraction. The polymer was then characterized through size exclusion chromatography and NMR methods, including DOSY and quantitative HSQC experiments, to facilitate an accurate analysis and open the door to further applications of this natural polymer.",

Structural characterization was performed by using 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, and X-ray diffraction experiments. The compounds underwent in vitro antiparasitic testing against Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Plasmodium falciparum, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Cytotoxicity evaluation was performed using rat myoblast (L6) cells. Perovskone (1) demonstrated excellent activity against T. cruzi, showing an IC50 value of 0.89 μM and a selectivity index (SI) of 14.9. Perovskone I (4) and perovskone G (2) exhibited potent activity against P. falciparum (IC50 values of 0.03 and 0.08 μM, respectively), with favorable SIs of 843.0 and 80.0, comparable to those of chloroquine and artemisinin. Perovskone M (8) displayed promising antileishmanial activity (IC50 = 0.44 μM, SI = 22), comparable to the efficacy of miltefosine against L. donovani (IC50 = 0.51 μM).

Despite their increasing prevalence, current therapeutic interventions remain suboptimal, constrained by substantial adverse effects and prohibitive treatment costs. Through an anti-lipid droplet (LD) accumulation screening platform, over 3000 methanolic extracts of Formosan plants were evaluated. Among them, the leaf extract of Syzygium simile demonstrated significant inhibitory activity of 40% at 25 μg/mL, emerging as the most promising species. Through bioassay-guided fractionation, 20 compounds were isolated from the n-hexane layer of the leaves, including nine new compounds [simisyzygins C-G (1-5, respectively) and simicadinenes A-D (6-9, respectively)] and 11 known compounds. These new compounds possess unique carbon skeletons characterized as flavonoid-sesquiterpenoid hybrids. Their structures were elucidated by the analysis of spectroscopic data. The structures of 1, 4, 5, and 11 were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Syzygioblane B (11) demonstrated the most potent inhibition of LD accumulation in Huh7 cells, achieving a 64.1% reduction at 40 μM with dose-dependency (5-40 μM) and no observable cytotoxicity. This is the first phytochemical and biological investigation of S. simile that highlights its potential as a promising botanical drug candidate for treating LD accumulation-related diseases.",

Previous in vitro studies have shown that (3S)-16,17-didehydrofalcarinol (1), a polyacetylene oxylipin isolated from Tridax procumbens, is active against Leishmania mexicana. We have analyzed the mechanism of action of compound 1, evaluating reactive oxygen species production, apoptosis of L. mexicana, cytotoxicity in murine macrophages, and its efficacy in controlling the disease progression and parasite load when applied topically in C57BL/6 mice infected with L. mexicana. Results show that parasites incubated with 1.6 μM compound 1 significantly increased reactive oxygen species production (p ≤ 0.05). The percentage of apoptosis also increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) and did not affect the viability of macrophages. The application of the topical formulations with 0.5% and 0.75% compound 1 for 7 weeks reduced disease progression and parasite load. We demonstrate that compound 1 generates the death of L. mexicana by apoptosis through reactive oxygen species production. We conclude that compound 1 can be used a possible alternative treatment for localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, enabling a less painful and more accessible therapy.",

Having in our laboratory some authentic samples of dibenzopyrrocoline-type Cryptocarya alkaloids, we decided to reinvestigate their absolute configuration using modern spectroscopic techniques along with TDDFT calculations. The NMR reinvestigation of the authentic sample of cryptowolinol led us to revise its relative configuration using ML-J-DP4 and DP4+ analyses. Moreover, the absolute configuration of all dibenzopyrrocoline alkaloids reported to date benefitted from a complete re-evaluation based on a comparison with TDDFT-SR and TDDFT-ECD predictions leading to a unified absolute configuration. At last, this patrimonial reinvestigation unveiled a historical sample corresponding to a heretofore unpublished dibenzopyrrocoline alkaloid, which we named isocryptaustoline. The reisolation of this molecule from the total alkaloid extract of Cryptocarya oubatchensis makes it a genuine natural product.",

    "abstract": "Natural hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) and riparins offer significant health benefits. However, their extraction from natural sources is difficult, and traditional synthetic methods remain wasteful, raising the need for more efficient alternatives. In this work, a two-step chemo-enzymatic flow method for the efficient esterification and amidation of phenolic acids was developed and successfully applied to the synthesis of riparin derivatives and HCAAs. The flow Fischer esterification was optimized using vanillic acid as a model starting material and SiliaBond Tosic Acid (SCX-3) as an immobilized acid catalyst, achieving a quantitative yield in a short residence time. The following amidation step, catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B, was optimized in toluene, leading to the desired amides. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their radical scavenging, antibacterial, and antileishmanial properties. Overall, this work disclosed a novel approach for the efficient synthesis of riparin derivatives and HCAAs with interesting biological properties.",

The structures of 1-7 were established by the analysis of NMR, high-resolution MS, and comparison of the experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Cinerol L (1) is particularly noteworthy, as it features a 5H-pyrrolo[1,2a]-benzimidazole moiety modified by an ethyl sulfonate, while cinerols N (3) and O (4) possess a unique acetyl-substituted hydroquinone moiety. Cinerols L-R (1-7) were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) with IC50 values of 5-20 μM in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Furthermore, the potent inhibitory activity on inflammatory cytokines of 4 prompted us to evaluate its effect on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, a critical pathway that contributes to the inflammatory responses. Cinerol O (4) was unveiled to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and the production of inflammatory cytokines via suppressing the expression of NF-κB and MAPKs in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Centella asiatica (L.) Urban (Apiaceae) has been utilized for centuries in traditional medicine systems in Southeast Asia and Southern Africa, including Madagascar. Previous studies have reported evidence of the therapeutic potential of C. asiatica formulations in models of Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) have been identified to be among the pharmacologically relevant metabolites contributing to the botanical's cognitive enhancement and neuroprotective effects. Isomers of CQAs are, however, difficult to differentiate by commonly used LC-MS techniques, making the characterization, standardization, and batch-to-batch consistency of these formulations challenging. Individual CQAs have unique proton Spin Network Fingerprints (pSNFs) that can be used to distinguish between CQA regioisomers within complex extracts. This work describes the development of a CQA-focused pSNF library that can be used to complement LC-MS methods for the accurate metabolite identification and characterization of bioactive C. asiatica fractions and extracts. The isolation of two new (1 and 2) and four known (3-6) CQAs and CQA analogues from C. asiatica and their contribution to the pSNF library are also discussed herein.",

    "abstract": "Sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a metal-dependent hydrolase that plays key roles in dNTP homeostasis, antiretroviral defense, and regulation of various cancers in humans. Beyond mammals, SAMHD1 is also present in a wide range of eukaryotes, including invertebrates, plants, and human parasites. Although the specific mechanisms and biological significance of SAMHD1 in these organisms are not well understood, its functions are linked to essential processes such as photosynthesis, genome maintenance, and immune response. In this study, we bioinformatically mined the SAMHD1 superfamily and selected the ortholog from the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis as a model system for both fungal and biochemically intractable plant SAMHD1s. Ri SAMHD1 retains the substrate promiscuity of the human enzyme but bypasses the strict requirement for allosteric activation through tetramerization, positioning it as a prototypical enzyme in which hydrolysis and allosteric regulation can be uncoupled. Its activity is selectively dependent on transition metal ions such as Mn and Fe, while Mg serves as a poor activator. Although Ri SAMHD1 lacks several ancillary regulatory features present in human SAMHD1, its activity is differentially modulated by GTP, which acts as an allosteric activator at lower concentrations and an allosteric inhibitor at higher concentrations. These results demonstrate that metal dependence and allosteric regulation are adaptive traits that have evolved divergently among mammals, fungi, and plants, invoking alternative molecular routes for fine-tuning dNTP levels. Our findings on Ri SAMHD1 provide a paradigm for the mechanistic diversification of SAMHD1 enzymes and offer valuable insights for dissecting the complex mechanisms of nucleotide regulation in humans.",

Vaccines are economical and effective means for combating infectious diseases. Herein, we present the first total synthesis of the highly functionalized mono- and oligosaccharides of B. hinzii O-antigen for vaccine development. The rare 2,3-diacetamidopyranoses were generated from 3-O-acetyl-2-nitroglycals via an organocatalyzed one-pot relay glycosylation method. The postglycosylation oxidation strategy was used to overcome the poor reactivity of 2,3-diacetamido-aldouronic acid building blocks in glycosylation reactions. Direct amidation of alduronic acid with NH3 in the late stage reduced the protecting group operation and increased the synthetic efficiency. Di-tert-butylsilylidene-directed α-galactosylation method was used to construct challenging 1,2-cis-glycosidic bond. Six oligosaccharides of B. hinzii O-antigen were obtained and further conjugated to human serum albumin for antigenicity evaluation (the sera antibodies were obtained from vaccinated mouse via inactivated B. hinzii). The terminal tetrasaccharide of B. hinzii O-antigen has been identified as a potential glycol-epitope and might be useful for vaccine development against B. hinzii.",

    "abstract": "Ru/C-catalyzed polyethylene (PE) and hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis under quasi-supercritical fluid of isopentane was kinetically and mechanistically investigated. PE hydrogenolysis with C-C and C-H cleavage showed zeroth order, suggesting strong adsorption of hydrocarbons. PE yielded broad product distribution of heavy (C21-40) and diesel-range (C11-20) hydrocarbons in the primary step of hydrogenolysis due to stochastic C-C cleavage over Ru surface. Catalytic hydrogenolysis of n-hexadecane, squalane, and light hydrocarbons such as n-pentane, iso-pentane, and n-hexane further described C-C cleavage reactivity between primary and secondary carbons, i.e., 1C-2C and 2C-2C, which has an order of magnitude higher hydrogenolysis rate than that involving a tertiary carbon. The PE saturated Ru surface and lower C-C cleavage reactivity of tertiary carbon in iso-pentane, therefore, imited sovlent conversion during hydrogenolysis, whereas leading to selective PE conversion. Using hexadecane, we observed comparable hydrogenolysis rates between H2 and D2 (k H /k D ∼ 1), indicating the kinetically relevant step of C-C cleavage with facilitating C-H cleavage and rehydrogenation. However, the normal kinetic isotope effect between hexadecane and deuterated hexadecane (k C16H34 /k C16D34 ∼ 5) revealed that the dehydrogenation, i.e., C-H cleavage, can be kinetically involved in the hydrogenolysis kinetic. By considering the 8-fold lower H-D exchange rate with deuterated hexadecane compared to n-hexadecane, the lower rate for hydrogenolysis and H-D exchange with deuterated hexadecane can be attributed to the C-D bond dissociation energy being 3 kJ/mol higher than that of the C-H bond. Increasing H2 pressure favors internal C-C bond cleavage over terminal one. This minimizes the formation of lower hydrocarbons, particularly methane. However, the increase in H2 pressure increases the coverage of adsorbed hydrogen on the Ru particles due to competitive adsorption of H2 and polyethylene, which, in turn, reduces the polyethylene conversion rates.",

    "abstract": "The simple but essential azetidinone core of the β-lactam antibiotics is uniquely N-sulfonated in the monobactam subfamily. This feature confers both target binding specificity to inactivate bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (antibiosis) and structural differentiation to elude destruction by metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). The recent FDA approval of Emblaveo to treat serious bacterial infections combines an established synthetic monobactam aztreonam and avibactam, which additionally blocks serine β-lactamases, to create a broadly effective antibacterial therapeutic. Here we report experiments to capture the native monobactam biosynthetic steps to the natural product sulfazecin with the aim of accessing new monobactams by reprogramming its biosynthetic machinery. In sulfazecin biosynthesis, the β-lactam ring is formed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase SulM that incorporates l-2,3-diaminopropionate (Dap), which is then N-sulfonated in trans and efficiently cyclized to the fully elaborated monobactam by an unusual thioesterase (TE) domain. We describe an improved synthesis of (2S,3R)-vinylDap to support rational structure-based engineering experiments to obtain the corresponding (4R)-vinyl sulfazecin. While these experiments were initially based on an AlphaFold model of the adenylation domain that incorporates Dap (SulM A3), we further report high-resolution X-ray crystal structures with both the l-Dap substrate and an accurate analogue of the activated (3R)-methyl-Dap adenylate bound. The ligand-bound structures rationalize the inability of SulA3 to incorporate larger substrates. Comparisons with the structures of other diamino acid-activating adenylation domains identify alternate binding modes that may be more suitable for the production of sulfazecin analogues. The impact of these structures on the further engineering of the SulA3 domain and its relation to monobactam synthesis in the recently structurally characterized SulTE are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic ammonia oxidation reaction (eAOR) have much to offer in terms of mechanistic investigations and practical energy issues. This work reports the use of complex [Ru(pdc-κ-N1O2)(bpy)(NH3)] (Ru-NH 3 ) (H2pdc = 2, 6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) bearing a readily accessible pdc2- ligand to catalyze ammonia oxidation under electrochemical conditions. The rich structural variations of Ru-NH 3 in coordinating solvents and an ammonia atmosphere were fully characterized by cyclic voltammograms (CVs), NMR, and XRD. CV experiments showed that Ru-NH 3 promotes electrocatalytic ammonia oxidation at a low overpotential of 0.85 V with a calculated catalytic rate (k obs) of 18.9 s-1. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) at an applied potential of 0.3 V vs Fc+/0 achieves 76.1 equiv of N2 with a faradaic efficiency of 89.8%. Experimental and computational analyses indicated that oxidation of Ru-NH 3 generates a reactive Ru III -NH 3 intermediate, which undergoes sequential electron and proton transfer steps to form a Ru VI ≡N species. N-N bond formation occurs via the nucleophilic attack of an ammonia molecule on the Ru VI ≡N moiety with a facile barrier of 8.6 kcal/mol. Eventually, N2 evolved as the product after releasing two electrons and three protons.",

    "abstract": "The activation of lattice oxygen at low temperatures is essential for heterogeneous catalytic oxidation, but exactly how this is achieved by adjusting the coordination structure of atomic sites is still elusive. Herein, the Cu1O3-CeO2 catalyst with highly dispersed unsaturated Cu1-O3 coordination was creatively engineered, which remarkably enhanced the low-temperature oxidation of CO (a typical model reaction) from 12% to 90% at 66 °C compared to conventional CuCeO x catalyst. The preservation of atomic coordination-deficient Cu sites enables the transfer of electron cloud density from Cu atoms to O atoms, hence, facilitating the activation of lattice oxygen. Further electron transfer from O atom to Cu species results in charge back-donation to form sufficient Cu+ and metal per-oxy species, contributing to weaken O-O bonds. We determined that the increasing number of electron donors induced by unsaturated atomic Cu1-O3 coordination is an efficient strategy to develop highly active and stable catalysts for lattice oxygen activation. The catalyst synthesis strategies and oxygen activation mechanism demonstrated in this work provide a generalizable platform for the future design of well-defined functional catalysts for low-temperature oxidation reactions.",

    "abstract": "Cationic micelles, composed of amphiphilic block copolymers with polycationic coronas, offer a customizable platform for mRNA delivery. Here, we present a library of 30 cationic micelle nanoparticles (MNPs) formulated from diblock copolymers with reactive poly(pentafluorophenol acrylate) backbones modified with diverse amines. This library systematically varies in nitrogen-based cationic functionalities, exhibiting a spectrum of properties that encompass varied degrees of alkyl substitution (A1-A5), piperazine (A6), oligoamine (A7), guanidinium (A8), and hydroxylation (A9-A10) that vary in side-chain volume, substitution pattern, hydrophilicity, and pK a to assess parameter impact on mRNA delivery. In vitro delivery assays using GFP+ mRNA across multiple cell lines reveal that amine side-chain bulk and chemical structure critically affect performance. Using machine learning analysis via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) on 180 formulations (3780 experimental measurements), we mapped key relationships between amine chemistry and performance metrics, finding that amine-specific binding efficiency was a major determinant of mRNA delivery efficacy, cell viability, and GFP intensity. Micelles with stronger mRNA binding capabilities (A1 and A7) have higher cellular delivery performance, whereas those with intermediate binding tendencies deliver a higher amount of functional mRNA per cell (A2, A10). This indicates that balancing the binding strength is crucial for performance. Micelles with hydrophobic and bulky pendant groups (A3-A5) tend to induce necrosis during cellular delivery, highlighting the significance of chemical optimization. A7 amphiphile, displaying primary and secondary amine, consistently demonstrates the highest GFP expression across various cell types and in vivo achieves high delivery specificity to lung tissue upon intravenous administration. Moreover, we established a strong correlation between in vitro and in vivo performance using Multitask Gaussian Process models, underscoring the predictive power of in vitro models for anticipating in vivo outcomes. Overall, this innovative study integrates advanced data science with experimental design, demonstrating the pivotal role of chemical amine-dependent optimization for advancing targeted mRNA delivery to the lungs.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are dynamic, membrane-bound organelles that play key roles in cellular waste disposal, macromolecule recycling, and signaling. Disruptions in lysosomal function and lipid composition are implicated in a wide range of diseases including lysosomal storage disorders, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Imaging of the lysosomal lipid composition has the potential to not only enhance the understanding of lysosome-related diseases and their progression but also help identify them. In this work, we present a novel viscosity-sensitive, green-emitting BODIPY probe that can distinguish between ordered and disordered lipid phases and selectively internalize into the lysosomal membranes of live cells. Through the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we demonstrate that lysosomal membranes in multiple cancer cells exhibit significantly higher microviscosities compared to noncancer cells. The differences in lysosomal microviscosities provide an effective approach for identifying cancer cells and indicate that malignant cells may possess more oxidized and saturated lysosomal lipid membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of viscosity-sensitive probes in quantifying the compositional changes in lysosomal membranes by investigating the effects of lysosome-permeabilizing cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), sertraline, and astemizole. Our results reveal that despite their functional similarities, these CADs exert opposite effects on lysosomal microviscosities in both cancerous and noncancerous cells, suggesting that different mechanisms may contribute to the CAD-induced lysosomal damage and leakage.",
